Our mission is to contribute to human progress by empowering people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world and have fun together. From start to finish 2020 reinforced the importance of that mission. During one of the most challenging years in recent history for our global community and their loved ones, our team worked hard to find ways to bring people closer together. We've enabled relationships to deepen and flourish, even as we were physically apart. We added 16 million daily active users this quarter for a total of 265 million up 22% year-over-year. This growth validates the broad appeal of our service and the role we play in the life of each member of the Snapchat community. Our quarterly revenue increased 62% year-over-year to $911 million showing the trust advertisers have placed in us and our communities receptiveness to brands with shared values. We expect our relationships with community members and business partners to become even stronger as our platform continues to evolve. We set an internal goal for full-year adjusted EBITDA profitability in 2020 and I'm excited to share that we achieved this with positive adjusted EBITDA of $45 million. As a result of exceptional efforts from our team members around the world and their disciplined execution, our fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA was $166 million. Achieving full-year profitability in the midst of such a difficult and destabilizing year proves the resilience of our business and represents an important milestone as we work towards being able to self-fund our investments in the future. Snapchat is embraced by a generation that is driving the future. The Snapchat Generation primarily Gen Z and millennials are 150% more likely to communicate with pictures than words and 82% of them believe they have a personal responsibility to change the world. Our opportunities to serve and uplift this community in the coming decades will continue to grow and we are inspired by the world that the Snapchat Generation is working to create. At the core of this opportunity is the power of our camera. It is one of the world's most used cameras with an average of over 5 billion snaps created every single day. Cameras are no longer only a means to capture a moment in time or a memory, they now enable a whole world of self-expression and visual communication and we have worked to drive this fundamental transformation since our founding. We've done this by putting the camera at the center of our application and the center of our strategy and by building businesses around it. Empowering people to communicate visually drives high-frequency engagement with our application with daily active users opening Snapchat 30 times per day on average. This means that improving speed, ease, and quality of visual communication are important for growing engagement. We finished rolling out new messaging infrastructure this quarter, making it easy to innovate and add new features within chat, while simultaneously improving performance and enabling regionalization of our chat infrastructure. We also made significant improvements to the video quality for Snaps while still ensuring Snapchat is the fastest way to communicate and share a moment. The first platform we built to extend the utility of the Snapchat camera beyond visual messaging was stories which allows Snapchatters, publishers, businesses and influencers to express themselves in creative and compelling ways without the pressures associated with traditional social media. Stories are a ephemeral display content in chronological order and don't have public likes or comments. We have evolved Stories over time to embrace new formats like shows with total time spent watching shows increasing nearly 70% year-over-year in 2020. Our commitment to both the quality and integrity of content on our service has driven a lot of this product evolution. Initiatives like our 2018 redesign to separate social content from media content, our content guidelines that we enforce equally across publishers and all community members and our early decision to create a hand-curated platform with Discover proved valuable as we have been able to provide trusted and reliable content to our community. For example, during the week of the US Presidential election nearly 30 million Snapchatters watched election related coverage on Discover from our trusted media partners. We're also excited to see the success the both new and traditional media companies are finding on our content platform. Partners ranging from digital natives like Wave TV, Barcroft, Team Whistle and Group 9 to more established media companies like NBC Universal, ESPN and Viacom CBS have each reached over 25 million viewers across their Discover channels in Q4. We have launched 10 new Snap Originals, including the second season of Will Smith's Will From Home, a show which has reached 43 million total viewers in its two seasons. Offering relevant content to our diverse and growing user base is an important part of our strategy. And we have a launched a record 97 new international Discover channels this quarter. Furthermore, we continue to add shows and publisher content offerings that appeal to older audiences with a 25% year-over-year increase in viewership among our 35 plus audience. The camera also drives engagement on our map. Our goal is to build the world's most personalized map and we made investments few years ago that are now paying dividends. Each month over 250 million Snapchatters open our map where they can find the people and places that mean the most to them. Our community can engage with shared stories from around the globe and explore new places by tapping on the map. There are now more than 35 million businesses on the map for our community to discover and connecting local businesses with prospective customers represents a substantial future revenue opportunity for our business. More recently, the power and frequency of use of our camera allowed us to launch Spotlight. We're really excited about the opportunity that this new platform creates for our community to reach a large audience with their most compelling snaps and to be rewarded for their creativity. We've long watched as some of the best snaps go viral on other platforms and wished to provide a way for snaps to reach a larger audience on Snapchat but we struggled to accomplish that in a way that aligns with our values. Spotlight combines a simple submission flow that allows people to submit their best snaps in just one tap with a rigorous review and ranking process that allows us to filter out content that is inconsistent with our guidelines, the result is a fun and safe product experience that services the best of Snapchat all in one place. Our primary goal in launching spotlight was to build critical mass, both in terms of video submissions and audience in a select set of countries, so that we could begin to rapidly iterate on content ranking and the overall product experience. We are seeing over 175,000 video submissions per day on average, in part due to our incentive program for creators where we distribute over $1 million per day to the top performing videos. Getting early momentum with creators is vital for attracting new viewers to the Spotlight experience and these investments have helped Spotlight grow to over 100 million monthly active users in January. Our product and ranking teams have been able to quickly improve our ability to match Spotlight viewers with the right content and we are now working on a broader rollout of Spotlight to our entire community. Our commitment to reinventing the camera is most evident through our advances in augmented reality. Today, more than 200 million people engage with AR on Snapchat every day on average. We have co-developed our vision for augmented reality together with our growing community and have created cutting-edge tools and capabilities that allow creators to build increasingly advanced lenses and distribute them to the entire Snapchat community. We are inspired everyday by the creativity of our creator community who have made over 1.5 million lenses using Lens Studio across a growing variety of use cases. For example, during a year when physical gatherings were difficult for many, AR remains integral to empowering Snapchatters self-expression, creativity and connectivity with loved ones during the holidays. For Diwali this year, many lenses leveraged new body tracking and segmentation capabilities, so people could spry on best of stories in AR. Our community played with Diwali theme lenses more than 500 million times, more than 8 times the engagement of our Diwali lenses last year. We are particularly excited about the ways that AR is evolving beyond self-expression, communication and entertainment. For example, our beauty partners have been accelerating their investments in virtual discovery and trial on experiences in response to the COVID pandemic. The Estee Lauder Companies brands, two faced cosmetics launched an eye makeup tutorial lens through Lens Studio. The Lens overlays each step of makeup application in augmented reality and can be activated anytime by scanning the product's packaging. The brand's lens organically, grew to become one of our top-performing lenses with millions of people using it to learn about the product. Other examples include NYX Professional Makeup's virtual store they created in Lens Studio where people can walk around and explore their products in AR. In addition to promoting this experience on their Snapchat brand profile, they're also leveraging Camera Kit to distribute their Lens to partners like Triller. We are doubling down on our solutions for beauty with our partnership with Perfect Corp which will enable hundreds of makeup brands to seamlessly create high quality makeup AR experiences. Beauty is just one of the many areas where we see opportunities to provide valuable utility through augmented reality. We are excited to continue investing in experiences like trying on clothes, visualizing products in your home, learning about the items and locations around you and so much more. We're excited about the progress we're making in collaboration with our partners on games, minis and Snap Kit. For example, Voodoo revamped one of its most popular games Aquapark, so Snapchatters can play in real-time with their friends on Snapchat, complete with in-game Bitmojis. TurboVote supported our Gen Z and millennial audience during the 2020 election with its voter registration mini, which helped register more than 1.2 million US Snapchatters. We recently launched an integration with Twitter using Creative Kit where Twitter users can share tweets directly through Snap's and Stories on Snapchat. Bitmoji kit helps personalize user experiences through people's beloved avatars whether on the Samsung default keyboard or when you're spending money on Venmo. We are now powering AR experiences on other apps through Camera Kit, further expanding the opportunity of Lens Studio. In just the past two years since our first partner summit, we have launched several new capabilities and thousands of successful partner integrations and we look forward to continuing this momentum, as we expand our platform. Looking forward, we are focused on continuing our disciplined execution on both our short and long-term goals for growing our business. We plan to make additional progress on profitability and free cash flow, accelerate our full-year revenue growth beyond the 46% year-over-year growth achieved in 2020 and grow our community around the world by improving and localizing the Snapchat product experience. We are also reorganizing our product team around the five core platforms on Snapchat; Map, Communication, Camera, Stories, and Spotlight which we believe will drive increase focus and operational excellence, as we transition each platform into a monetizable business. We successfully made that transition with stories which we monetized with full-screen vertical video ads and with our camera where businesses can pay to promote their lenses. All of our platforms shared the same powerful monetization infrastructure, which drives strong ROI for our advertising partners. In time, we look forward to creating new ways for businesses to reach customers on our map, engage with their customers using Minis and games and chat and extend the reach of their video campaigns on Spotlight. Lastly, we see a tremendous opportunity to innovate in e-commerce, which to date has been largely driven by utilitarian benefits such as price, selection and convenience. As we have learned from our progress and providing new ways for people to try on and interact with products using augmented reality, improvements in the shopping experience to make it more entertaining and immersive can lead to powerful downstream results in terms of conversion. We plan to experiment rapidly and plant many seeds because we see this opportunity as very large and still very early in terms of maturity despite the massive step change in adoption, due to the global pandemic. This year has shown us that there is nothing more important than the people we share our lives with. As the global health crisis is addressed and the world begins to reopen, we see opportunities to help strengthen the bonds of the Snapchat community all over the world and are committed to making sure Snap continues to play a positive and constructive role in people's lives. I look forward to speaking with many of you in a few weeks at our first-ever Investor Day when you'll have the chance to meet more of our extraordinary team. Until then take care and stay safe. I'll now turn it over to Jeremi to share more about our business.\nJeremi Gorman: Thanks, Evan. 2020 was an important year for us. We are in the early stages of an inflection point, as we work towards becoming a cornerstone of advertiser's media plans and growing our always-on budget, which positions Snap for a long runway of growth. Not only have we invested for the future, but we also delivered strong results amidst unforeseen challenges throughout the year and demonstrated the resilience of our team, our business and our ability to deliver strong ROI through one of the most extra normal times in our industry's existence. In 2020, our full year revenue was $2.5 billion, growing at 46% year-over-year, an acceleration of 1% from 2019. In Q4 2020, we generated revenue of $911 million, a significant acceleration of 18 percentage points to 62% year-over-year growth. These results are a byproduct of the hard work being done across all teams at Snap and validate the decisions we've made around our business structure, our go-to-market strategy and the products we have built for our community and advertisers. While brand advertisers encountered some disruption during the year, direct response advertisers remained steady as we continued to demonstrate that we are an efficient platform for driving results across down funnel metrics. In Q1 of 2020, our business grew 58% year-over-year during January and February but slowed in March and throughout Q2 as the realities of COVID-19 and subsequent economic impacted the course. However, in Q3 and Q4, we saw many existing advertisers return to Snap and so many new ones leverage our innovative ad formats and bidding capabilities to drive real business value on our platform. This drove active advertisers to an all-time high. In addition, our brand safe environment and privacy-first approach has differentiated us from our peers. These emerged as important themes in 2020, we don't believe they are going away and they have led to improved advertiser retention and increased demand. The recent audit of digital platforms and advertising spend by many brands has given us an opportunity to educate the highest levels of our industry on our points of differentiation and safety by design principles. We have been able to tell our story to an attentive elevated audience but is reevaluating marketing dollar allocations, while there is still more to do, we are excited to continue building on our recent results and investing to capitalize on our momentum. We are fully focused on making progress against our revenue and ARPU opportunities, which we believe will be driven by our three key priorities. First, investing in our sales and marketing functions by continuing to train higher and build for scale. Second, driving ROI through measurement, relevance and optimization. And third, building innovative ad experiences around video and augmented reality. Our unwavering commitment to these three priorities along with our unique reach and growing global audience allow us to drive performance at scale for businesses around the world. The pandemic and stay-at-home orders accelerated the digital transformation creating a new normal where brands are trying to determine the technology and trends that are here to stay. For instance, with a more limited ability to get physical products in the hands of consumers in store, more brands are turning into augmented reality for virtual try-on including combining AR and video tutorials for a best-in-class try-on experience. This trend is only accelerating with the Snapchat Generation. Our reach among 13 to 34 year-olds in many of our established markets continues to grow could which give our business incredible insights on what these generations are looking for. And our priority is helping brands connect with the Snapchat generation in new and unique ways. Our sales model allows us to build deep domain expertise and to prioritize and pivot resources on certain verticals accelerate or decelerate with macro trends. This approach proved its value in 2020 and we were able to focus our investments on top-performing verticals, which included e-commerce, CPG, tech, telco, gaming, streaming, financial Services and restaurants. For example, even while films were largely out of the theaters because we have highly performing ad products, we saw impressive growth in streaming and we're pleased to see our entertainment advertising partners increase spend as they pivoted to direct response. In addition, we also saw QSR brands such as Chipotle leverage our location-based technology to encourage customers to order and pick up meals from their restaurants at scale. Our ad platform is maturing to a place where as advertisers move their dollars they see strong ROI giving us increased confidence that budgets will build over time. We are also offering more down funnel bidding capabilities that allow advertisers to optimize for the objectives they are trying to achieve and we continue to scale these products in 2020. For example, revenue from our pixel verified sign up goal-based bidding product increased more than four times year-over-year in Q4, one of four down-funnel optimizations that our year-over-year revenue growth in excess of four times as we continue to see strong advertiser adoption of our goal-based bidding optimization. We believe this is one of the clearance ways for us to scale revenue and close the ARPU gap relative to our peers. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought rapid change in shopping patterns, as people have moved their consumption online. Direct-to-consumer businesses are flourishing and consumers are looking for new ways to discover product at home. We are committed to finding new ways to support businesses via out ad products and tooling capabilities while providing our community with new ways of experiencing the products and brands that they love. Many advertisers were able to leverage our ad formats that naturally support the e-commerce opportunity. For example, UGG, a part of Deckers brands started testing Dynamic Ads in October 2019. After initial testing proved to be extremely successful, they increased investment by over 10 times in Q4 of 2020, during one of the most competitive times of the year for shoppers. This solution, not only helped them drive relevance during the holiday period, but they've shared this will be a key performance driver throughout the year. Brands are also exploring new ways to drive social commerce. In Q4, Ralph Lauren leveraged multiple components of our platform to drive both awareness and business results. First, they invested in creating a collection of Bitmoji outfits as an inspired effort to engage younger audience which proved to be extremely successful. Over 20 million users dressed their Bitmoji in Ralph Lauren and tried on the collection over 550 million times in the first five months of the partnership. Next, they utilized our Scan camera technology to enable an AR shopping experience after Snapchatters scanned their ubiquitous Pony logo. And finally, they built a new brand profile, which offers a permanent home for their brand, content and AR experiences on Snapchat. We continue to invest heavily to grow our video advertising business, the primary way we monetize Snapchat. We see more opportunity over time to grow video inventory particularly via the growth in viewership of Spotlight and Stories. We're using multiple products shows incremental results, for instance, Marc Jacobs leveraged Snap Ads and Commercials to drive sales and their new fragrance line, their Commercials campaign resulted in 43 point lift in Ad Awareness and a 6 point lift in purchase intent. Beyond video ad, we are focused on using augmented reality to solve real business problems for brands, allowing advertisers to engage with our audience directly via our camera. Adoption of our AR lenses has benefited from virtual try-on, consumers are in need of new ways to experience products and brands need to reach consumers where they are, at home. With both consumers and brands open to these new experiences, our platform is perfect for this moment. For example, Dior recently launched an AR trial Lens featuring 65 products from their new B-27 sneaker launch. Internationally, OnePlus India created lenses for Diwali as a means to bring people together safely during the pandemic. Their lenses garnered over 80 million impressions and reached over 14 million Snapchatters in India. Overall, the campaign was highly successful and drove a 9 point lift in both ad awareness and a 7 point lift in message awareness. We've also been investing and optimization algorithm that dynamically serve AR experiences for Snapchatters who are most likely to meet brands call. We've seen shoppable lens campaigns drove a 2.4 times higher intent lift than the average across all Snapchat campaigns measured in Q3. Lastly, businesses leveraging AR as one component of a larger multi-product campaign on Snapchat tend to achieve stronger results. For example, Activision Call of Duty: Black Ops ran one of the most successful campaigns we have seen in console gaming. They leveraged Snap Ads commercials and a reach in frequency Lens and saw an 11 point lift in favorability and a 5 point lift in purchase intent. Moreover, Snapchatters exposed to multiple ad products saw a 10 point lift in intent and the Lens drove a 17 point lift in intent. There is a lot more work to do in helping businesses achieve their goals via AR, but we are thrilled with the results that our partners are seeing and we're going to continue investing in this opportunity. In conclusion, we started 2020 on a high note and we ended it with accelerating momentum, which we plan to carry forward in 2021, continuing to drive ROI and performance for our advertising partners investing in innovative ad unit and providing support for our sales and marketing functions. I am confident in our long-term trajectory and I look forward to sharing even more at our Investor Day in a few weeks. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Derek.\nDerek Andersen: Thanks, Jeremi. Our Q4 financial results reflect our priorities of growing our community making focused investments in the future of our business and scaling our operations efficiently in order to drive towards profitability and positive free cash flow. As Evan mentioned earlier, our community grew to 265 million daily active users in Q4, an increase of 47 million or 22% year-over-year, which represents an acceleration over the prior quarter growth rate of 18%. The growth in our community continues to be broad-based, with year-over-year and sequential growth on both iOS and Android platforms and in each of North America, Europe and Rest of World. In North America, DAU grew by 5 million or 6% year-over-year to reach $92 million. In Europe, DAU grew by 7 million or 10% to reach 74 million. In Rest of World DAU grew by 35 million or 55% to reach 99 million. The acceleration of growth in Rest of World reflects the benefit of improved application performance in local markets, the popularity of Augmented Reality lenses created by our community and investments to better serve our community, including local content, local marketing partnerships, and broader language support. Total revenue for Q4 was $911 million, an increase of 62% year-over-year representing a 10 percentage point acceleration over the prior quarter. While global ARPU grew 33% over the same period, we continue to see strong adoption of our advertising products in Q4. Revenue from our Commercials ad product more than doubled year-over-year in Q4, as we continue to see building demand from advertisers seeking to reach Gen Z and millennial audiences at scale and with a full-screen video advertising product that is delivered adjacent to brand-safe content. In addition, revenue from our pixel verified purchase goal-based bidding products more than tripled year-over-year in Q4, as we have continued to benefit from strong adoption of our pixel by our advertising partners over the past year. Overall eCPM in Q4, increased 46% year-over-year driven by a combination of mix shift towards a higher eCPM product, such as Commercials, mix shift towards higher eCPM regions with the relatively higher growth in North America, as well as a rapid rise in overall demand sequentially. Despite this growth in eCPM, we believe our eCPMs remain well below market rates for our audiences and ad units. The ongoing growth of our community combined with deep engagement within our app, including deep engagement across platforms we have not yet begun to monetize, gives us ample opportunity to expand inventory and our ARPU opportunity over time. We continue to make improvements to our targeting and optimization capabilities that allow us to utilize our inventory more efficiently. In addition, we more than doubled the number of active advertisers year-over-year in Q4, which further contributed to our ability to optimize our targeting by providing a greater diversity of advertising offers for our models to select from. For example, while eCPMs for inventory monetized by our pixel verified purchases rose by 41% sequentially in Q4. The cost per purchase for our advertising partners declined by 11% over the same period. Consequently, we believe that we will be able to deliver attractive returns on ad spend to our advertising partners as eCPM grows over the long term. Gross margins were 59% in Q4, up 3 percentage points year-over-year. We continue to make significant progress against our goal of driving down our underlying infrastructure unit costs over time. In Q4, these efforts resulted in infrastructure costs per DAU of $0.69, down from $0.72 in the prior year. On the content side, we invested to support the launch of spotlight in Q4 and this contributed approximately $40 million to our cost of revenue in Q4, representing a 5 percentage point headwind to gross margin expansion in the quarter. While it is still very early in the development of this new content platform, we are highly encouraged by the initial results and excited about the potential for Spotlight to further expand our monetization opportunity in the future. We are particularly pleased that we have been able to support the launch of Spotlight while continuing to expand our gross margins, which reflects our overall approach of scaling our operations efficiently while making investments in the future of our business. Operating expenses were $369 million in Q4, up 36% year-over-year. People and related costs grew 33% year-over-year in Q4, driven by a 24% increase in average full-time headcount and higher cash compensation cost per team member. Growth in our average full time headcount was driven primarily by continued focused investments in our monetization and engineering teams to scale our top-line growth and accelerate the pace of our product innovation. As we noted earlier this year, we have invested incrementally in our cash-based compensation programs in 2020. However, this investment is offset by a lower rate of dilution. In addition, we have continued to grow our investments in marketing in order to build on the momentum, we have established with our advertising and Snapchatter communities. While it typically takes time for the benefit of these investments to become evident in our output metrics, we are encouraged with the progress we have observed thus far. Q4 marked our second consecutive quarter of adjusted EBITDA profitability at $166 million for the quarter, an improvement of $123 million year-over-year. We noted on our prior call that our cost structure would grow at a faster rate in Q4 than in any recent quarter and this was the case as we invested in content to support the launch of spotlight in hiring to grow our talent base and in marketing, as I noted earlier. That said, we were particularly pleased that we were able to make these investments, while still delivering adjusted EBITDA leverage of 35% in Q4 as we continue to make progress towards profitability and sustain positive free cash flow. Net income was negative $113 million in Q4, an improvement of $128 million over the prior year and $87 million over the prior quarter. The year-over-year improvement in net income reflects the flow-through of improved adjusted EBITDA and a favorable comparison against the one-time legal expense that was accrued in the prior year. These factors were partially offset by the impact of interest expense related to the convertible notes issued over the past year and higher stock-based compensation, driven by a higher headcount and higher payroll taxes that vary with the stock price. Total fully diluted shares outstanding grew just 3% year-over-year in Q4, down from 5% in the same quarter of last year. We consider careful management of our fully diluted shares outstanding to be a key input to building shareholder value over the long term, and we are pleased to see our output metrics reflect the progress we have made in this area. Free cash flow for Q4 was negative $69 million, an improvement of $7 million year-over-year driven by the improvements in adjusted EBITDA that were largely offset by the timing of a $98 million legal settlement payment made in Q4 and the net increase in working capital that resulted from accelerating revenue growth. Notably, absent, the one-time legal settlement payment in Q4, we would have generated approximately $29 million in free cash flow in Q4, which we view as a positive demonstration of our progress towards sustained free cash flow generation. We ended the quarter with $2.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, up from $2.1 billion in the prior year as the proceeds of convertible notes issued in Q2 of 2020, more than offset the investments we have made to grow the business over the past year. Before we discuss the quarter ahead, I would like to take a moment to reflect on the remarkable progress we have made as a business. Growth in our community is accelerating and we have now delivered five consecutive quarters of year-over-year DAU growth in excess of 15%. Full year revenue for 2020 was $2.5 billion, an increase of 46% year-over-year and we exited 2020 with the highest year-over-year revenue growth rate we have reported since 2017. Our revenue has more than doubled since 2018 and while we have invested aggressively in the future of our business, we have expanded our gross margins by 19 percentage points and delivered 47% of our incremental revenue to the adjusted EBITDA line over the same two-year period. We set a goal to achieve full-year adjusted EBITDA profitability at the outset of 2020 and while the past year presented many unexpected challenges and opportunities, we are tremendously proud of the way our teams executed this year in order to reach this milestone by delivering $45 million in adjusted EBITDA profit in 2020. We are closer than ever to achieving our goal of delivering sustained positive free cash flow and being able to self-fund our investments in the future as a result. We have also strengthened our balance sheet materially over the past two years and ended 2020 with more than $3.5 billion in available working capital inclusive of cash, marketable securities and/or existing credit facilities. We close out 2020 with strong momentum across our platforms and well-positioned for the future. We look forward to speaking with you more about the future of our business and our long-term financial opportunity during our first ever Investor Day on February 23. Until then, I would like to share a little bit about how we expect Q1 may unfold. While we have benefited from an improving operating environment in the second half of 2020 and remain optimistic about the momentum, we have established in our business, we are conscious that external factors may emerge that could impact our momentum. For example, we experienced a period of interruption to advertising demand, in the first two weeks of January as many brand advertisers paused campaigns during this period amid events at the US Capital. And thus we started the quarter slower than we would have otherwise expected. We anticipate that the iOS platform policy changes to be implemented later this quarter will present another risk of interruption to demand in the period immediately after they are implemented. It is not clear yet what the longer-term impact of those changes may be for the top-line momentum of our business, and this may not be clear until several months or more after the changes are implemented. As we look forward to Q1, we estimate the daily active users will grow year-over-year in Q1 at a rate of approximately 20% to reach 275 million. On the revenue side, if we are able to sustain the momentum, we have observed in recent weeks, we believe that our revenue growth rate approximately equal to what we reported in Q4 could be attainable in Q1. That said, our guidance range is for year-over-year revenue growth of 56% to 60% and this range reflects our best estimate of the potential impact of interruptions to demand associated with the iOS platform changes that we anticipate will be implemented in the final month of the quarter. This would result in revenue of approximately $720 million o $740 million in Q1. On the expense side, we intend to continue to invest in the long-term growth of our business and we will continue to support the launch of Spotlight with our $1 million per day creator fund in order to build on the momentum we are seeing with this exciting new platform. As a result, we estimate that adjusted EBITDA will be approximately negative $70 million to negative $50 million in Q1. Thank you for joining our call today and we will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRoss Sandler: Two questions, maybe start off with overall demand environment for Snapchat advertising in 2021 question. So Google and Facebook, which are these behemoths in the industry are both talking about accelerating growth in 1Q and 2Q. And I know there's a lot of moving pieces with - you're tough comp in Jan, Feb and then the easy comp in March and then decide EFA stuff, so I guess what's baked in - is the 60% growth you're seeing like kind of what's happening right now? How material of an impact do you see from the iOS changes, any additional color there would be helpful, just on the overall macro? And then, add in the second question is, you guys have launched a lot of cool new products over the years, you invented a lot of things in this industry, how would you rank Spotlight in terms of your new products that you've launched in terms of potential to drive significant increase in either user growth or engagement compared to maybe maps are games or some of the cool lenses you've put out? Thanks a lot.\nDerek Andersen: Thanks a lot, Ross, it's Derek speaking. I'll take the first part of your question, then I'll kick the second part about spotlight over to Evan. Maybe just to give you a little more color on the forward look and the guide on revenue, I guess what I'd say is, for starters, we're really encouraged by the momentum we've established for their advertising partners in general at a high level. We saw the active advertisers double year-over-year in Q4, and we think that's a pretty, pretty strong indicator that we're delivering value to our partners and we have good momentum with them. We're also pleased with the growth we've been able to put up in total on the revenue line at 62% in Q4, which is a 10 point acceleration over the prior quarter of 52. So, the range we're looking at in the quarter is between 56% and 60% is what we gave on the guide, which would be amongst the highest year-over-year growth rates we reported as a public company, but potentially just below the prior quarter. And I can share a little more context there. One as you noted at the beginning of the quarter, we did see some positives from advertisers at the beginning of the quarter. I mean some of the events that we saw at the capital, we have worked with our partners reestablished the momentum we've got campaigns back going since then and we've resumed momentum after this period. I noted a little bit in prepared remarks that if we were able to sustain the momentum we're seeing right now in recent weeks, through the remainder of the quarter, we actually think that we could achieve growth rates in Q1 that are approximately in line with what we observed in Q4. That said, we do anticipate that there could be another interruption to demand later in the quarter, as we see some of the iOS changes implemented and as we work with our advertising partners to navigate those changes also implemented. So given that risk of interruption in demand that lies ahead, we wanted to make sure that we call that out and also to ensure that any guide we provided reflect our best estimate of those risks to interruption in the back half of the Q. So as I said earlier, it isn't clear what the longer-term impact will be to our top-line momentum of that, this may not be clear for some time after the changes are implemented. So, the risk we're calling out here is more specific to the interruptions we expect during the period of implementation of those changes to the platform as we work through those with our partners. So again, really pleased with the momentum that we saw in the second half of 2020, really pleased with the acceleration that we saw on Q4 top-line to 62% and pleased with the momentum that we're seeing in the business right now and working to keep that momentum going. So hopefully that gives you a little bit more color. I'll turn it over to Evan to touch on Spotlight.\nEvan Spiegel: Thanks Ross, for the question on Spotlight, we're very pleasantly surprised with the momentum Spotlight but admittedly, I think we start with some great raw ingredients, meaning we have such a widely used camera with over 5 billion snaps made every day, and incredibly creative community and of course, a really large audience that loves watching mobile content. So, maybe we should have expected it, but so far it's really often the races with over 175,000 video submissions every day, and an audience of over 100 million people in January. So, really excited with the early momentum, and we now that we have both sides of the marketplace, meaning the content submissions and the audience, we can do a lot of work to optimize our ranking and make sure we're doing a good job with content understanding, serving the right content to the right people based on their interest. So lots of opportunity ahead and the team is making great progress really quickly growing engagement on that product. So really excited about where we're at with that.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Levine of Pivotal Research Group. Please go ahead.\nMichael Levine: Well, thanks for the question guys. I'd love to ask both Jeremi and Evan, on the AR and VR front, I guess I'm curious do you think that this could be the year that we really see an inflection with respect to advertisers willing to invest in this from a content perspective and what do you, what do you feel like advertisers basically still need to see in place to go ahead and feel comfortable with that?\nJeremi Gorman: Hi Michael, thanks for the question. Yeah, I think you know it's been a really exciting period for us, we've seen a lot of acceleration in demand for AR advertising in particular as more and more people are at home and the living room becomes a new showroom. And at this time, we really don't see going backwards. In terms of becoming more mainstream and showing up more regularly and advertiser buys, I think there is kind of three focus is there, the first is on delivering ROI with AR and we started to develop a lot of those tools, which I'll talk about in a second here. And then, reducing the cost of creating AR, really important largely by commoditizing the and democratizing the ability to do it. And then lastly, again, it is just kind of ease of creation. So most importantly, we have the reach and engagement with augmented reality to build a large business and some of the businesses they're both using lenses. So as Evan just mentioned over 5 billion videos and pictures taken every day in the camera. So really, really great base to build on there and foundation. And then we've been new focused on demonstrating the ROI of investing in lenses and I think that's really important. What used to be this kind of takeover products for the big branding moments have now turned into a highly performing ad format where you can buy directly from the lenses themselves, where you can do goal-based bidding down funnel activities on lenses. For AR, the creative can take a bit longer to develop and therefore it's really important that the results speak for themselves. They have to be worked at when you advertisers put this in, but some of our recent efforts we're trying had definitely lead to meaningful improvements in purchase and conversion. As I mentioned, it does take a little bit of time to build that we're also heavily investing and improving tooling for lenses and making them easier to build in Lens Studio including creating Lens web builder to make it anyone - easy for anyone to build their own AR experience online, but honestly going forward, we will see a huge opportunity to innovate in augmented reality and we have been blown away by our community and how they've leverage tools like Snap machine learning which allows people to upload ML models and run them in real time within Lenses, the power new experiences. We believe that engagement with augmented reality is at a meaningful scale and to answer your question directly. Yes, it definitely justifies advertiser intent. And we've been able to validate those investments with clear ROI. So we're going to continue to make lenses easier to create and more powerful, which will help grow the AR opportunity for years to come.\nOperator: The next question comes from Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nHeath Terry: I was wondering if you could update us a bit on the strategy for Snap Audience Network, particularly with Unity coming on board. What kind of impact do you expect that's going to have to its contribution - the Audience networks contribution to grow and then maybe from a higher level for partners that are at the scale that something like Unity, how do they make the decision to work with Snap versus what are the other networks that's available to them?\nDerek Andersen: It's Derek speaking, I think the first thing I'd say is we're very early with the Snap Audience Network. It's not currently a significant or material part of the business at this point in time and so it's not also factored in as a major factor on a go-forward. So we're very early in the process of growing and experimenting with our business and bringing on partners that can help the business. So very early to be talking about the direction that that's going to drive in terms of revenue and top-line growth and what have you. I think what I would say, at a very high level though is that partners value our unique ad formats and that's one of the things that makes our platform attractive and of course, vertical video being a part of that augmented reality and of course, bringing the audience into that. So very early, we'll update you as that becomes more significant. But we're just getting started in that area today.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rich Greenfield of LightShed Partners. Please go ahead.\nRich Greenfield: Hi, thanks for taking a couple of questions. First, we see the word [indiscernible], it's sort of used everywhere, it seems these days, but the avatars are generally tied to each platform and Evan you bought Bitmoji a while ago. We're starting to obviously see it more and more places and wondering does this have the potential to sort of be a global or universal avatar and how should we think about monetization opportunities for Bitmoji not just within gaming what beyond gaming? So just sort of any recent examples are just what are you thinking about Bitmoji over the next couple of years? And then two, I think over the last couple of calls, you talked about sort of how Map is going to start to see more and more businesses and I think in the prepared remarks you made comments about personalized map or the most personalized map, when do we start to see small and medium businesses really start to populate on the map? Is that a 2021 event or do we have to wait longer. Thanks so much.\nEvan Spiegel: Thanks rick. We're so excited about what's happening with Bitmoji and the team has been doing such an incredible job driving towards their vision of being the world's avatar, we've got a couple of focus areas for Bitmoji. One of them is just involving the avatars themselves, the avatar style. We've been investing a lot in 3D, which enables use in much more sophisticated games. So that's been a big focus of ours and of course making a lot easier for people to express themselves with their avatar that means improving the Bitmoji editor adding new fashion brands and partners like Ralph Lauren that Jeremy mentioned earlier. And of course trying to improve and strengthen the Avatar bond, the bond that people have with their Bitmoji which we do through partnerships. So for example, the integration of Bitmoji with the Samsung keyboard. So, we're going to continue pushing forward on those fronts. We certainly see opportunity for monetization longer term. But frankly, the opportunity is just still so large and so early that we're going to invest in improving avatar themselves and really increasing their utility interestingly one example that we saw recently was game developer that integrated their Bitmoji into their games so radically reduced conversion costs and customer acquisition, which had then allowed them to monetize their game at a higher rate. And so that's a really cool example where we're extending Bitmoji into partner games and services adding a lot of value for the partner and of course, adding value for our community because they feel so strongly about their relationship with the Bitmoji that are excited to play a game really as themselves. So that's definitely a great opportunity for us looking forward, and then when it comes to the Map, I think it is probably important just maybe breakout the SMB opportunity into two sort of different maybe categories; one, in our digital native smaller businesses and they're really trying to grow with things like our dynamic product ads or goal-based bidding, which we have our pixel integration for but if we look at local businesses, there definitely is an opportunity longer term on the Map. We started just by making sure the businesses can be easily discovered on the Map today and we're really focused on adding actions around those businesses. So right now you can place an order or find directions, make a reservation, you can share with your friends and we're going to continue to build engagement around businesses on the Map and over time will be able, I think to convert that into another monetizable surface for Snap. So, as with all of our platforms, we really just try to create value for our community to build that engagement and then over time think about converting that into a business. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJustin Post: It's been really interesting, Evan, to watch the evolution of the app over time and big change in November when it's considerably smoother than one of the prior changes, just what are your learning from that and are you really seeing an increase in engagement from that change since that happened and what can you tell us about that. And secondly, obviously Spotlight is to a great start. Do you see that usage is incremental or is it taking maybe away a little bit from other areas? Thank you.\nEvan Spiegel: That's a great question. Thanks so much. So I think first and foremost huge credit to our engineering and product teams and of course all the folks working on our data platform and whatnot, who have gotten so good. They are really understanding what's happening on our platform, being able to test and iterate on big changes that we're making and they've just done an outstanding job allowing us to continue to move really quickly and try really big ideas without being disruptive to the platform overall. So, really all the credit goes to the team on that one and what we're excited about is now that we've built that muscle and we've demonstrated that we can move really quickly on these big changes that frees us up to try new things. And that combined with these platform investments in iOS for example, more recently, where we have improved the architecture on the client itself similar to how we approached some of the challenges we faced on Android, those changes also allow us to move faster. So, we've got this combination out really deep understanding of what's happening on our platform, the ability to test, really, really quickly and a new architecture that allows us to move faster both on the front end and the back end. So, overall just really can't thank the team enough for all their hard work there and it shows that we're going to be able to move a lot faster and innovate in the future. And then separately, when we look at Spotlight we're super excited. So far, it looks like a lot of that engagement is incremental and that really speaks to the new layout of the service around the action bar which allows people to easily access different parts of the platform and that doesn't totally surprise me because Spotlight fills a really different need than Stories for example that allow you to catch up with your closest friends and really see the world from their perspective. So as we look at Spotlight that content, it's really the best of Snapchat and people are submitting the snaps that are the funniest or most engaging or most interesting. So I definitely think that content fills a really different need for our community, and we're excited about the engagement we're seeing so far.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead\nLloyd Walmsley: Thanks. Two questions if I can. First just, the 4x growth in dollars around four down funnel metrics is spectacular. How do you guys get comfortable that the momentum in these ad unit is sustainable through these upcoming iOS changes that are going to effectively blind ad platforms to down funnel measurement. Is Apple going to back down in some of these restrictions or do you think opt-in rates are high, or are your CPMs just so low and services like Spotlight just so meaningful that it doesn't matter but curious to get your take on that. And then secondly, you now have ad units to help advertisers across the funnel. So when you look at your customer base and what they're doing, are they using all of these tools on Snap. How are you going to market to make them aware of all that, how much of an opportunity is it to get them buying across all of these units and leveraging the full value of the platform.\nJeremi Gorman: Thanks, Lloyd. Really appreciate the question. I'll take the IDSA one first, and the 4x growth as you're saying in our down funnel metrics were also thrilled to see that, but as it comes to IDSA and the changes whether or not that will impact us, the reality is we admire Apple and we believe that they are trying to do the right thing for their customers. They're focused on protecting privacy is aligned with our values in the way that we've built our business from the very beginning. So, the team here that we're really focused on has less to do with IDSA for which Apple has long offered an opt-out and instead on a much more broad policy change that requires Snapchatters to opt-in to tracking with other personal identifiers such as their email address, which was really harder for us than the overall digital ad ecosystem to match advertising outcomes. But we've been working really closely with Apple to implement SK ad network, which is their privacy protective as well as building our own solutions that use aggregated data to protect privacy. We've been communicating very well with advertisers, educating them, talking about them deeply about these coming changes and encouraging them to implement our conversion API and measurement to mitigate any of this and then longer term we're investing and using first party data from our platform and providing more opportunities for on platform conversion that will really help. Overall, we feel really well prepared to these changes. But changes to this ecosystem are usually disruptive and the outcome is uncertain. To talk to your second question regarding the ad units and how it's helping advertisers across the funnel, you're right, the advertisers who are most successful on Snap are using broad - our broad portfolio of targeting optimization and/or format choices across AR, Commercials, Snap Ads, Story Ads going in with each of the goal-based bidding products and really optimizing their overall campaign. We do see a significant opportunity to get more advertisers using all the features and functionality that we offer. We do have multiple case studies that show the value of utilizing multiple formats. The ones I just mentioned before, but we don't make it as easy as we thought. So it's very much still day one here in terms of ensuring that all of our advertisers use as many of our products as possible to get the best outcome for their dollar, but we are specifically focused on driving adoption, retention driving products and features and we know that ROI is the best retention future we could possibly have. So we continue to focus on measurement optimization and delivering that ROI for our advertising partners.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mark Shmulik of Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nMark Shmulik: Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess if we think about advertisers growing 2x this year, as we look ahead to kind of 2021 and sales objectives, any color you can share and how you think about that strategically between continuing to grow the advertiser base versus, I think what we just talked about around growing share of wallet in cross-selling more products and services within it. And then my second question, well I'm generally not want to kind of compare across, I think this quarter you guys really only wants to grow domestic users sequentially. So, any color you can share on what you've been doing to drive that re-acceleration and whether you expect those trends to continue? Thank you.\nJeremi Gorman: Sure, this is Jeremi. As mentioned before regarding advertiser growth, we exited in 2020 with both the best momentum we've ever had in our advertising business, more than doubling advertiser count year-over-year in Q4 and again putting up highest number of advertisers of all time. I think the important part about that is really the diversity of advertisers and the diversity of demand in our ecosystem and how that makes our entire marketplace stronger. We set up our team in three different category, the first of which focuses on enterprise or large-scale plants that have complex buying structures and then there is a tier called emerging, which is focused on advertisers that really focus on VR and ensuring that those app installed e-com, et cetera. And then lastly, we have a skill function that goes out to get small medium businesses, small e-commerce advertisers, people who utilize Shopify as their back-end for instance, have a diversity of advertisers set in the ecosystem. So that everybody can succeed. So we're really focused on growing that demand and we'll continue to do so for years to come.\nEvan Spiegel: On the DAU question, we're really excited about the momentum we're continuing to see in the United States. I think a lot of this has to do with the large investments we've made in underlying technology platform form over the last several years. In addition to a lot of fantastic innovation around things like augmented reality and of course Spotlight. So, we're going to continue to differentiate our products, do our best to really serve the needs of our community. And I think we're still at the early stages of our growth given how powerful visual communication is, young people in particular prefer to communicate visually, and increasingly, we're seeing people embrace visual communication as their preferred method. So well, a lot of opportunity in front of us there, and thankfully, a lot of these investments we've made over the last few years are paying off.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, the first one on Spotlight monetization, curious just to hear about what - what sort of mechanics or technologies are already in place for you to start to test on Spotlight monetization and what are some of the investments you still need to make to sort of eventually start to beta test and rollout Spotlight monetization as we think about 2021? And then, the second one on content investment, maybe, Evan, just talk about, as you look at the explore tab, what do you think are sort of some of the key content investment areas that will be important for that tab to continue to evolve throughout 2021?\nEvan Spiegel: Yes. So I think as it pertains to the monetization timing on Spotlight, it's still really early. We're going to focus on growing engagement. But fortunately, we've got a lot of demand for our vertical video, which is the format we will use to monetize Spotlight and of course, all the underlying advertising infrastructure. So I think Spotlight will be a great way for folks to extend their video campaigns, but again, we're focused on the product experience today and we'll think about testing a little bit further down the road. And then as it pertains to Discover we've been doing a lot here, especially on content supply. So really trying to understand what sort of content is resonating with our community, where the gaps are in terms of different demographics and interest, making sure that we can meet that demand with the requisite supply and then taking a couple of big bets around compelling new shows for our community, because we see that there is really a lack of investment in premium mobile video and that's an area where we can - we can really grow. So I think overall, we're just able to use a lot of our understanding of our audience to think about where to make content investments and improved supply either with original content or through syndication and of course, with our partners.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the question. Evan, just wanted to ask the early 1Q disruption stands in contrast, I think to your positioning as a curated and more brand safe platform. So, just curious if you can talk about your efforts here and just how much the differentiation is resonating with marketers and agencies? Thanks.\nEvan Spiegel: Jeremi might be better positioned to talk about how our positioning is resonating with advertisers, I know she's having a lot of conversations with our partners. But I think just broadly speaking, when it comes to some of the policy changes that Apple is making. We really think of them as high integrity folks and we're happy to see them making the right decision for their customers. So, of course, this is in line with how we've been thinking about building our business since the beginning, we really innovated and I think we'll continue to innovate. So this is really an opportunity to work together with our partners, work together with Apple and really move forward in a way that benefits everyone in particular consumers who deserve to be protected.\nJeremi Gorman: And I can take it that from there regarding what advertisers and agencies are saying to us. I think when we look at the overall industry, the growth - the growing focus on brand safety and privacy across the entire industry actually places us in a really unique and beneficial position given what Evan just said, which is that, from the beginning of our business, we made defining decisions that helps us avoid many of the issues seen on other platforms. So a lot of the conversations we're having with advertisers and agencies are around things like the fact that we don't have any comments. For instance, the fact that it is that - our groups can only be 64 people, that is another good example of that but friendship need to be bidirectional and when you get into that with advertisers and agencies, they truly understand how our design was different from the beginning. In addition, we have very clear policies and we adhere to those policies consistently. But it really is the very foundation of both our consumer product and our advertising business that's been built around commitment to brand safety and privacy. So the positives that we mentioned for earlier in the year aren't related to Snap specifically, some minor disruption as it pertains to the overall market, as things we're shifting and changing, but we believe that building trust with trust with our community and providing a safe environment on Snapchat is actually the most critical things to our long-term success because our customers coming here and they have fun and they feel safe and it's a private and enjoy their experience on Snapchat, which means that they will continue to stay with us for years to come and those growing audiences or what advertisers want to see. And we really take this all very seriously, including with Spotlight all content is manually reviewed by our team before its surface to a large number of Snapchatters meaning it can't go viral without a manual review and we will continue to adhere to those practices as it's core to our foundation and frankly, from my point of view, it has been an extreme tailwind as advertisers look to align their values other businesses that share those same values in our safety by design and privacy by design principles and commitment to our community, really, a lineup with looking at their money.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session as well as Snap Inc.'s fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Thank you for attending today's session. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Derek Andersen",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeremi. Our Q4 financial results reflect our priorities of growing our community making focused investments in the future of our business and scaling our operations efficiently in order to drive towards profitability and positive free cash flow. As Evan mentioned earlier, our community grew to 265 million daily active users in Q4, an increase of 47 million or 22% year-over-year, which represents an acceleration over the prior quarter growth rate of 18%. The growth in our community continues to be broad-based, with year-over-year and sequential growth on both iOS and Android platforms and in each of North America, Europe and Rest of World. In North America, DAU grew by 5 million or 6% year-over-year to reach $92 million. In Europe, DAU grew by 7 million or 10% to reach 74 million. In Rest of World DAU grew by 35 million or 55% to reach 99 million. The acceleration of growth in Rest of World reflects the benefit of improved application performance in local markets, the popularity of Augmented Reality lenses created by our community and investments to better serve our community, including local content, local marketing partnerships, and broader language support. Total revenue for Q4 was $911 million, an increase of 62% year-over-year representing a 10 percentage point acceleration over the prior quarter. While global ARPU grew 33% over the same period, we continue to see strong adoption of our advertising products in Q4. Revenue from our Commercials ad product more than doubled year-over-year in Q4, as we continue to see building demand from advertisers seeking to reach Gen Z and millennial audiences at scale and with a full-screen video advertising product that is delivered adjacent to brand-safe content. In addition, revenue from our pixel verified purchase goal-based bidding products more than tripled year-over-year in Q4, as we have continued to benefit from strong adoption of our pixel by our advertising partners over the past year. Overall eCPM in Q4, increased 46% year-over-year driven by a combination of mix shift towards a higher eCPM product, such as Commercials, mix shift towards higher eCPM regions with the relatively higher growth in North America, as well as a rapid rise in overall demand sequentially. Despite this growth in eCPM, we believe our eCPMs remain well below market rates for our audiences and ad units. The ongoing growth of our community combined with deep engagement within our app, including deep engagement across platforms we have not yet begun to monetize, gives us ample opportunity to expand inventory and our ARPU opportunity over time. We continue to make improvements to our targeting and optimization capabilities that allow us to utilize our inventory more efficiently. In addition, we more than doubled the number of active advertisers year-over-year in Q4, which further contributed to our ability to optimize our targeting by providing a greater diversity of advertising offers for our models to select from. For example, while eCPMs for inventory monetized by our pixel verified purchases rose by 41% sequentially in Q4. The cost per purchase for our advertising partners declined by 11% over the same period. Consequently, we believe that we will be able to deliver attractive returns on ad spend to our advertising partners as eCPM grows over the long term. Gross margins were 59% in Q4, up 3 percentage points year-over-year. We continue to make significant progress against our goal of driving down our underlying infrastructure unit costs over time. In Q4, these efforts resulted in infrastructure costs per DAU of $0.69, down from $0.72 in the prior year. On the content side, we invested to support the launch of spotlight in Q4 and this contributed approximately $40 million to our cost of revenue in Q4, representing a 5 percentage point headwind to gross margin expansion in the quarter. While it is still very early in the development of this new content platform, we are highly encouraged by the initial results and excited about the potential for Spotlight to further expand our monetization opportunity in the future. We are particularly pleased that we have been able to support the launch of Spotlight while continuing to expand our gross margins, which reflects our overall approach of scaling our operations efficiently while making investments in the future of our business. Operating expenses were $369 million in Q4, up 36% year-over-year. People and related costs grew 33% year-over-year in Q4, driven by a 24% increase in average full-time headcount and higher cash compensation cost per team member. Growth in our average full time headcount was driven primarily by continued focused investments in our monetization and engineering teams to scale our top-line growth and accelerate the pace of our product innovation. As we noted earlier this year, we have invested incrementally in our cash-based compensation programs in 2020. However, this investment is offset by a lower rate of dilution. In addition, we have continued to grow our investments in marketing in order to build on the momentum, we have established with our advertising and Snapchatter communities. While it typically takes time for the benefit of these investments to become evident in our output metrics, we are encouraged with the progress we have observed thus far. Q4 marked our second consecutive quarter of adjusted EBITDA profitability at $166 million for the quarter, an improvement of $123 million year-over-year. We noted on our prior call that our cost structure would grow at a faster rate in Q4 than in any recent quarter and this was the case as we invested in content to support the launch of spotlight in hiring to grow our talent base and in marketing, as I noted earlier. That said, we were particularly pleased that we were able to make these investments, while still delivering adjusted EBITDA leverage of 35% in Q4 as we continue to make progress towards profitability and sustain positive free cash flow. Net income was negative $113 million in Q4, an improvement of $128 million over the prior year and $87 million over the prior quarter. The year-over-year improvement in net income reflects the flow-through of improved adjusted EBITDA and a favorable comparison against the one-time legal expense that was accrued in the prior year. These factors were partially offset by the impact of interest expense related to the convertible notes issued over the past year and higher stock-based compensation, driven by a higher headcount and higher payroll taxes that vary with the stock price. Total fully diluted shares outstanding grew just 3% year-over-year in Q4, down from 5% in the same quarter of last year. We consider careful management of our fully diluted shares outstanding to be a key input to building shareholder value over the long term, and we are pleased to see our output metrics reflect the progress we have made in this area. Free cash flow for Q4 was negative $69 million, an improvement of $7 million year-over-year driven by the improvements in adjusted EBITDA that were largely offset by the timing of a $98 million legal settlement payment made in Q4 and the net increase in working capital that resulted from accelerating revenue growth. Notably, absent, the one-time legal settlement payment in Q4, we would have generated approximately $29 million in free cash flow in Q4, which we view as a positive demonstration of our progress towards sustained free cash flow generation. We ended the quarter with $2.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, up from $2.1 billion in the prior year as the proceeds of convertible notes issued in Q2 of 2020, more than offset the investments we have made to grow the business over the past year. Before we discuss the quarter ahead, I would like to take a moment to reflect on the remarkable progress we have made as a business. Growth in our community is accelerating and we have now delivered five consecutive quarters of year-over-year DAU growth in excess of 15%. Full year revenue for 2020 was $2.5 billion, an increase of 46% year-over-year and we exited 2020 with the highest year-over-year revenue growth rate we have reported since 2017. Our revenue has more than doubled since 2018 and while we have invested aggressively in the future of our business, we have expanded our gross margins by 19 percentage points and delivered 47% of our incremental revenue to the adjusted EBITDA line over the same two-year period. We set a goal to achieve full-year adjusted EBITDA profitability at the outset of 2020 and while the past year presented many unexpected challenges and opportunities, we are tremendously proud of the way our teams executed this year in order to reach this milestone by delivering $45 million in adjusted EBITDA profit in 2020. We are closer than ever to achieving our goal of delivering sustained positive free cash flow and being able to self-fund our investments in the future as a result. We have also strengthened our balance sheet materially over the past two years and ended 2020 with more than $3.5 billion in available working capital inclusive of cash, marketable securities and/or existing credit facilities. We close out 2020 with strong momentum across our platforms and well-positioned for the future. We look forward to speaking with you more about the future of our business and our long-term financial opportunity during our first ever Investor Day on February 23. Until then, I would like to share a little bit about how we expect Q1 may unfold. While we have benefited from an improving operating environment in the second half of 2020 and remain optimistic about the momentum, we have established in our business, we are conscious that external factors may emerge that could impact our momentum. For example, we experienced a period of interruption to advertising demand, in the first two weeks of January as many brand advertisers paused campaigns during this period amid events at the US Capital. And thus we started the quarter slower than we would have otherwise expected. We anticipate that the iOS platform policy changes to be implemented later this quarter will present another risk of interruption to demand in the period immediately after they are implemented. It is not clear yet what the longer-term impact of those changes may be for the top-line momentum of our business, and this may not be clear until several months or more after the changes are implemented. As we look forward to Q1, we estimate the daily active users will grow year-over-year in Q1 at a rate of approximately 20% to reach 275 million. On the revenue side, if we are able to sustain the momentum, we have observed in recent weeks, we believe that our revenue growth rate approximately equal to what we reported in Q4 could be attainable in Q1. That said, our guidance range is for year-over-year revenue growth of 56% to 60% and this range reflects our best estimate of the potential impact of interruptions to demand associated with the iOS platform changes that we anticipate will be implemented in the final month of the quarter. This would result in revenue of approximately $720 million o $740 million in Q1. On the expense side, we intend to continue to invest in the long-term growth of our business and we will continue to support the launch of Spotlight with our $1 million per day creator fund in order to build on the momentum we are seeing with this exciting new platform. As a result, we estimate that adjusted EBITDA will be approximately negative $70 million to negative $50 million in Q1. Thank you for joining our call today and we will now take your questions. Thanks a lot, Ross, it's Derek speaking. I'll take the first part of your question, then I'll kick the second part about spotlight over to Evan. Maybe just to give you a little more color on the forward look and the guide on revenue, I guess what I'd say is, for starters, we're really encouraged by the momentum we've established for their advertising partners in general at a high level. We saw the active advertisers double year-over-year in Q4, and we think that's a pretty, pretty strong indicator that we're delivering value to our partners and we have good momentum with them. We're also pleased with the growth we've been able to put up in total on the revenue line at 62% in Q4, which is a 10 point acceleration over the prior quarter of 52. So, the range we're looking at in the quarter is between 56% and 60% is what we gave on the guide, which would be amongst the highest year-over-year growth rates we reported as a public company, but potentially just below the prior quarter. And I can share a little more context there. One as you noted at the beginning of the quarter, we did see some positives from advertisers at the beginning of the quarter. I mean some of the events that we saw at the capital, we have worked with our partners reestablished the momentum we've got campaigns back going since then and we've resumed momentum after this period. I noted a little bit in prepared remarks that if we were able to sustain the momentum we're seeing right now in recent weeks, through the remainder of the quarter, we actually think that we could achieve growth rates in Q1 that are approximately in line with what we observed in Q4. That said, we do anticipate that there could be another interruption to demand later in the quarter, as we see some of the iOS changes implemented and as we work with our advertising partners to navigate those changes also implemented. So given that risk of interruption in demand that lies ahead, we wanted to make sure that we call that out and also to ensure that any guide we provided reflect our best estimate of those risks to interruption in the back half of the Q. So as I said earlier, it isn't clear what the longer-term impact will be to our top-line momentum of that, this may not be clear for some time after the changes are implemented. So, the risk we're calling out here is more specific to the interruptions we expect during the period of implementation of those changes to the platform as we work through those with our partners. So again, really pleased with the momentum that we saw in the second half of 2020, really pleased with the acceleration that we saw on Q4 top-line to 62% and pleased with the momentum that we're seeing in the business right now and working to keep that momentum going. So hopefully that gives you a little bit more color. I'll turn it over to Evan to touch on Spotlight. It's Derek speaking, I think the first thing I'd say is we're very early with the Snap Audience Network. It's not currently a significant or material part of the business at this point in time and so it's not also factored in as a major factor on a go-forward. So we're very early in the process of growing and experimenting with our business and bringing on partners that can help the business. So very early to be talking about the direction that that's going to drive in terms of revenue and top-line growth and what have you. I think what I would say, at a very high level though is that partners value our unique ad formats and that's one of the things that makes our platform attractive and of course, vertical video being a part of that augmented reality and of course, bringing the audience into that. So very early, we'll update you as that becomes more significant. But we're just getting started in that area today."

            "content": "Thanks, Evan. 2020 was an important year for us. We are in the early stages of an inflection point, as we work towards becoming a cornerstone of advertiser's media plans and growing our always-on budget, which positions Snap for a long runway of growth. Not only have we invested for the future, but we also delivered strong results amidst unforeseen challenges throughout the year and demonstrated the resilience of our team, our business and our ability to deliver strong ROI through one of the most extra normal times in our industry's existence. In 2020, our full year revenue was $2.5 billion, growing at 46% year-over-year, an acceleration of 1% from 2019. In Q4 2020, we generated revenue of $911 million, a significant acceleration of 18 percentage points to 62% year-over-year growth. These results are a byproduct of the hard work being done across all teams at Snap and validate the decisions we've made around our business structure, our go-to-market strategy and the products we have built for our community and advertisers. While brand advertisers encountered some disruption during the year, direct response advertisers remained steady as we continued to demonstrate that we are an efficient platform for driving results across down funnel metrics. In Q1 of 2020, our business grew 58% year-over-year during January and February but slowed in March and throughout Q2 as the realities of COVID-19 and subsequent economic impacted the course. However, in Q3 and Q4, we saw many existing advertisers return to Snap and so many new ones leverage our innovative ad formats and bidding capabilities to drive real business value on our platform. This drove active advertisers to an all-time high. In addition, our brand safe environment and privacy-first approach has differentiated us from our peers. These emerged as important themes in 2020, we don't believe they are going away and they have led to improved advertiser retention and increased demand. The recent audit of digital platforms and advertising spend by many brands has given us an opportunity to educate the highest levels of our industry on our points of differentiation and safety by design principles. We have been able to tell our story to an attentive elevated audience but is reevaluating marketing dollar allocations, while there is still more to do, we are excited to continue building on our recent results and investing to capitalize on our momentum. We are fully focused on making progress against our revenue and ARPU opportunities, which we believe will be driven by our three key priorities. First, investing in our sales and marketing functions by continuing to train higher and build for scale. Second, driving ROI through measurement, relevance and optimization. And third, building innovative ad experiences around video and augmented reality. Our unwavering commitment to these three priorities along with our unique reach and growing global audience allow us to drive performance at scale for businesses around the world. The pandemic and stay-at-home orders accelerated the digital transformation creating a new normal where brands are trying to determine the technology and trends that are here to stay. For instance, with a more limited ability to get physical products in the hands of consumers in store, more brands are turning into augmented reality for virtual try-on including combining AR and video tutorials for a best-in-class try-on experience. This trend is only accelerating with the Snapchat Generation. Our reach among 13 to 34 year-olds in many of our established markets continues to grow could which give our business incredible insights on what these generations are looking for. And our priority is helping brands connect with the Snapchat generation in new and unique ways. Our sales model allows us to build deep domain expertise and to prioritize and pivot resources on certain verticals accelerate or decelerate with macro trends. This approach proved its value in 2020 and we were able to focus our investments on top-performing verticals, which included e-commerce, CPG, tech, telco, gaming, streaming, financial Services and restaurants. For example, even while films were largely out of the theaters because we have highly performing ad products, we saw impressive growth in streaming and we're pleased to see our entertainment advertising partners increase spend as they pivoted to direct response. In addition, we also saw QSR brands such as Chipotle leverage our location-based technology to encourage customers to order and pick up meals from their restaurants at scale. Our ad platform is maturing to a place where as advertisers move their dollars they see strong ROI giving us increased confidence that budgets will build over time. We are also offering more down funnel bidding capabilities that allow advertisers to optimize for the objectives they are trying to achieve and we continue to scale these products in 2020. For example, revenue from our pixel verified sign up goal-based bidding product increased more than four times year-over-year in Q4, one of four down-funnel optimizations that our year-over-year revenue growth in excess of four times as we continue to see strong advertiser adoption of our goal-based bidding optimization. We believe this is one of the clearance ways for us to scale revenue and close the ARPU gap relative to our peers. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought rapid change in shopping patterns, as people have moved their consumption online. Direct-to-consumer businesses are flourishing and consumers are looking for new ways to discover product at home. We are committed to finding new ways to support businesses via out ad products and tooling capabilities while providing our community with new ways of experiencing the products and brands that they love. Many advertisers were able to leverage our ad formats that naturally support the e-commerce opportunity. For example, UGG, a part of Deckers brands started testing Dynamic Ads in October 2019. After initial testing proved to be extremely successful, they increased investment by over 10 times in Q4 of 2020, during one of the most competitive times of the year for shoppers. This solution, not only helped them drive relevance during the holiday period, but they've shared this will be a key performance driver throughout the year. Brands are also exploring new ways to drive social commerce. In Q4, Ralph Lauren leveraged multiple components of our platform to drive both awareness and business results. First, they invested in creating a collection of Bitmoji outfits as an inspired effort to engage younger audience which proved to be extremely successful. Over 20 million users dressed their Bitmoji in Ralph Lauren and tried on the collection over 550 million times in the first five months of the partnership. Next, they utilized our Scan camera technology to enable an AR shopping experience after Snapchatters scanned their ubiquitous Pony logo. And finally, they built a new brand profile, which offers a permanent home for their brand, content and AR experiences on Snapchat. We continue to invest heavily to grow our video advertising business, the primary way we monetize Snapchat. We see more opportunity over time to grow video inventory particularly via the growth in viewership of Spotlight and Stories. We're using multiple products shows incremental results, for instance, Marc Jacobs leveraged Snap Ads and Commercials to drive sales and their new fragrance line, their Commercials campaign resulted in 43 point lift in Ad Awareness and a 6 point lift in purchase intent. Beyond video ad, we are focused on using augmented reality to solve real business problems for brands, allowing advertisers to engage with our audience directly via our camera. Adoption of our AR lenses has benefited from virtual try-on, consumers are in need of new ways to experience products and brands need to reach consumers where they are, at home. With both consumers and brands open to these new experiences, our platform is perfect for this moment. For example, Dior recently launched an AR trial Lens featuring 65 products from their new B-27 sneaker launch. Internationally, OnePlus India created lenses for Diwali as a means to bring people together safely during the pandemic. Their lenses garnered over 80 million impressions and reached over 14 million Snapchatters in India. Overall, the campaign was highly successful and drove a 9 point lift in both ad awareness and a 7 point lift in message awareness. We've also been investing and optimization algorithm that dynamically serve AR experiences for Snapchatters who are most likely to meet brands call. We've seen shoppable lens campaigns drove a 2.4 times higher intent lift than the average across all Snapchat campaigns measured in Q3. Lastly, businesses leveraging AR as one component of a larger multi-product campaign on Snapchat tend to achieve stronger results. For example, Activision Call of Duty: Black Ops ran one of the most successful campaigns we have seen in console gaming. They leveraged Snap Ads commercials and a reach in frequency Lens and saw an 11 point lift in favorability and a 5 point lift in purchase intent. Moreover, Snapchatters exposed to multiple ad products saw a 10 point lift in intent and the Lens drove a 17 point lift in intent. There is a lot more work to do in helping businesses achieve their goals via AR, but we are thrilled with the results that our partners are seeing and we're going to continue investing in this opportunity. In conclusion, we started 2020 on a high note and we ended it with accelerating momentum, which we plan to carry forward in 2021, continuing to drive ROI and performance for our advertising partners investing in innovative ad unit and providing support for our sales and marketing functions. I am confident in our long-term trajectory and I look forward to sharing even more at our Investor Day in a few weeks. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Derek. Hi Michael, thanks for the question. Yeah, I think you know it's been a really exciting period for us, we've seen a lot of acceleration in demand for AR advertising in particular as more and more people are at home and the living room becomes a new showroom. And at this time, we really don't see going backwards. In terms of becoming more mainstream and showing up more regularly and advertiser buys, I think there is kind of three focus is there, the first is on delivering ROI with AR and we started to develop a lot of those tools, which I'll talk about in a second here. And then, reducing the cost of creating AR, really important largely by commoditizing the and democratizing the ability to do it. And then lastly, again, it is just kind of ease of creation. So most importantly, we have the reach and engagement with augmented reality to build a large business and some of the businesses they're both using lenses. So as Evan just mentioned over 5 billion videos and pictures taken every day in the camera. So really, really great base to build on there and foundation. And then we've been new focused on demonstrating the ROI of investing in lenses and I think that's really important. What used to be this kind of takeover products for the big branding moments have now turned into a highly performing ad format where you can buy directly from the lenses themselves, where you can do goal-based bidding down funnel activities on lenses. For AR, the creative can take a bit longer to develop and therefore it's really important that the results speak for themselves. They have to be worked at when you advertisers put this in, but some of our recent efforts we're trying had definitely lead to meaningful improvements in purchase and conversion. As I mentioned, it does take a little bit of time to build that we're also heavily investing and improving tooling for lenses and making them easier to build in Lens Studio including creating Lens web builder to make it anyone - easy for anyone to build their own AR experience online, but honestly going forward, we will see a huge opportunity to innovate in augmented reality and we have been blown away by our community and how they've leverage tools like Snap machine learning which allows people to upload ML models and run them in real time within Lenses, the power new experiences. We believe that engagement with augmented reality is at a meaningful scale and to answer your question directly. Yes, it definitely justifies advertiser intent. And we've been able to validate those investments with clear ROI. So we're going to continue to make lenses easier to create and more powerful, which will help grow the AR opportunity for years to come. Thanks, Lloyd. Really appreciate the question. I'll take the IDSA one first, and the 4x growth as you're saying in our down funnel metrics were also thrilled to see that, but as it comes to IDSA and the changes whether or not that will impact us, the reality is we admire Apple and we believe that they are trying to do the right thing for their customers. They're focused on protecting privacy is aligned with our values in the way that we've built our business from the very beginning. So, the team here that we're really focused on has less to do with IDSA for which Apple has long offered an opt-out and instead on a much more broad policy change that requires Snapchatters to opt-in to tracking with other personal identifiers such as their email address, which was really harder for us than the overall digital ad ecosystem to match advertising outcomes. But we've been working really closely with Apple to implement SK ad network, which is their privacy protective as well as building our own solutions that use aggregated data to protect privacy. We've been communicating very well with advertisers, educating them, talking about them deeply about these coming changes and encouraging them to implement our conversion API and measurement to mitigate any of this and then longer term we're investing and using first party data from our platform and providing more opportunities for on platform conversion that will really help. Overall, we feel really well prepared to these changes. But changes to this ecosystem are usually disruptive and the outcome is uncertain. To talk to your second question regarding the ad units and how it's helping advertisers across the funnel, you're right, the advertisers who are most successful on Snap are using broad - our broad portfolio of targeting optimization and/or format choices across AR, Commercials, Snap Ads, Story Ads going in with each of the goal-based bidding products and really optimizing their overall campaign. We do see a significant opportunity to get more advertisers using all the features and functionality that we offer. We do have multiple case studies that show the value of utilizing multiple formats. The ones I just mentioned before, but we don't make it as easy as we thought. So it's very much still day one here in terms of ensuring that all of our advertisers use as many of our products as possible to get the best outcome for their dollar, but we are specifically focused on driving adoption, retention driving products and features and we know that ROI is the best retention future we could possibly have. So we continue to focus on measurement optimization and delivering that ROI for our advertising partners. Sure, this is Jeremi. As mentioned before regarding advertiser growth, we exited in 2020 with both the best momentum we've ever had in our advertising business, more than doubling advertiser count year-over-year in Q4 and again putting up highest number of advertisers of all time. I think the important part about that is really the diversity of advertisers and the diversity of demand in our ecosystem and how that makes our entire marketplace stronger. We set up our team in three different category, the first of which focuses on enterprise or large-scale plants that have complex buying structures and then there is a tier called emerging, which is focused on advertisers that really focus on VR and ensuring that those app installed e-com, et cetera. And then lastly, we have a skill function that goes out to get small medium businesses, small e-commerce advertisers, people who utilize Shopify as their back-end for instance, have a diversity of advertisers set in the ecosystem. So that everybody can succeed. So we're really focused on growing that demand and we'll continue to do so for years to come. And I can take it that from there regarding what advertisers and agencies are saying to us. I think when we look at the overall industry, the growth - the growing focus on brand safety and privacy across the entire industry actually places us in a really unique and beneficial position given what Evan just said, which is that, from the beginning of our business, we made defining decisions that helps us avoid many of the issues seen on other platforms. So a lot of the conversations we're having with advertisers and agencies are around things like the fact that we don't have any comments. For instance, the fact that it is that - our groups can only be 64 people, that is another good example of that but friendship need to be bidirectional and when you get into that with advertisers and agencies, they truly understand how our design was different from the beginning. In addition, we have very clear policies and we adhere to those policies consistently. But it really is the very foundation of both our consumer product and our advertising business that's been built around commitment to brand safety and privacy. So the positives that we mentioned for earlier in the year aren't related to Snap specifically, some minor disruption as it pertains to the overall market, as things we're shifting and changing, but we believe that building trust with trust with our community and providing a safe environment on Snapchat is actually the most critical things to our long-term success because our customers coming here and they have fun and they feel safe and it's a private and enjoy their experience on Snapchat, which means that they will continue to stay with us for years to come and those growing audiences or what advertisers want to see. And we really take this all very seriously, including with Spotlight all content is manually reviewed by our team before its surface to a large number of Snapchatters meaning it can't go viral without a manual review and we will continue to adhere to those practices as it's core to our foundation and frankly, from my point of view, it has been an extreme tailwind as advertisers look to align their values other businesses that share those same values in our safety by design and privacy by design principles and commitment to our community, really, a lineup with looking at their money."

            "name": "Evan Spiegel",
            "content": "Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our mission is to contribute to human progress by empowering people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world and have fun together. From start to finish 2020 reinforced the importance of that mission. During one of the most challenging years in recent history for our global community and their loved ones, our team worked hard to find ways to bring people closer together. We've enabled relationships to deepen and flourish, even as we were physically apart. We added 16 million daily active users this quarter for a total of 265 million up 22% year-over-year. This growth validates the broad appeal of our service and the role we play in the life of each member of the Snapchat community. Our quarterly revenue increased 62% year-over-year to $911 million showing the trust advertisers have placed in us and our communities receptiveness to brands with shared values. We expect our relationships with community members and business partners to become even stronger as our platform continues to evolve. We set an internal goal for full-year adjusted EBITDA profitability in 2020 and I'm excited to share that we achieved this with positive adjusted EBITDA of $45 million. As a result of exceptional efforts from our team members around the world and their disciplined execution, our fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA was $166 million. Achieving full-year profitability in the midst of such a difficult and destabilizing year proves the resilience of our business and represents an important milestone as we work towards being able to self-fund our investments in the future. Snapchat is embraced by a generation that is driving the future. The Snapchat Generation primarily Gen Z and millennials are 150% more likely to communicate with pictures than words and 82% of them believe they have a personal responsibility to change the world. Our opportunities to serve and uplift this community in the coming decades will continue to grow and we are inspired by the world that the Snapchat Generation is working to create. At the core of this opportunity is the power of our camera. It is one of the world's most used cameras with an average of over 5 billion snaps created every single day. Cameras are no longer only a means to capture a moment in time or a memory, they now enable a whole world of self-expression and visual communication and we have worked to drive this fundamental transformation since our founding. We've done this by putting the camera at the center of our application and the center of our strategy and by building businesses around it. Empowering people to communicate visually drives high-frequency engagement with our application with daily active users opening Snapchat 30 times per day on average. This means that improving speed, ease, and quality of visual communication are important for growing engagement. We finished rolling out new messaging infrastructure this quarter, making it easy to innovate and add new features within chat, while simultaneously improving performance and enabling regionalization of our chat infrastructure. We also made significant improvements to the video quality for Snaps while still ensuring Snapchat is the fastest way to communicate and share a moment. The first platform we built to extend the utility of the Snapchat camera beyond visual messaging was stories which allows Snapchatters, publishers, businesses and influencers to express themselves in creative and compelling ways without the pressures associated with traditional social media. Stories are a ephemeral display content in chronological order and don't have public likes or comments. We have evolved Stories over time to embrace new formats like shows with total time spent watching shows increasing nearly 70% year-over-year in 2020. Our commitment to both the quality and integrity of content on our service has driven a lot of this product evolution. Initiatives like our 2018 redesign to separate social content from media content, our content guidelines that we enforce equally across publishers and all community members and our early decision to create a hand-curated platform with Discover proved valuable as we have been able to provide trusted and reliable content to our community. For example, during the week of the US Presidential election nearly 30 million Snapchatters watched election related coverage on Discover from our trusted media partners. We're also excited to see the success the both new and traditional media companies are finding on our content platform. Partners ranging from digital natives like Wave TV, Barcroft, Team Whistle and Group 9 to more established media companies like NBC Universal, ESPN and Viacom CBS have each reached over 25 million viewers across their Discover channels in Q4. We have launched 10 new Snap Originals, including the second season of Will Smith's Will From Home, a show which has reached 43 million total viewers in its two seasons. Offering relevant content to our diverse and growing user base is an important part of our strategy. And we have a launched a record 97 new international Discover channels this quarter. Furthermore, we continue to add shows and publisher content offerings that appeal to older audiences with a 25% year-over-year increase in viewership among our 35 plus audience. The camera also drives engagement on our map. Our goal is to build the world's most personalized map and we made investments few years ago that are now paying dividends. Each month over 250 million Snapchatters open our map where they can find the people and places that mean the most to them. Our community can engage with shared stories from around the globe and explore new places by tapping on the map. There are now more than 35 million businesses on the map for our community to discover and connecting local businesses with prospective customers represents a substantial future revenue opportunity for our business. More recently, the power and frequency of use of our camera allowed us to launch Spotlight. We're really excited about the opportunity that this new platform creates for our community to reach a large audience with their most compelling snaps and to be rewarded for their creativity. We've long watched as some of the best snaps go viral on other platforms and wished to provide a way for snaps to reach a larger audience on Snapchat but we struggled to accomplish that in a way that aligns with our values. Spotlight combines a simple submission flow that allows people to submit their best snaps in just one tap with a rigorous review and ranking process that allows us to filter out content that is inconsistent with our guidelines, the result is a fun and safe product experience that services the best of Snapchat all in one place. Our primary goal in launching spotlight was to build critical mass, both in terms of video submissions and audience in a select set of countries, so that we could begin to rapidly iterate on content ranking and the overall product experience. We are seeing over 175,000 video submissions per day on average, in part due to our incentive program for creators where we distribute over $1 million per day to the top performing videos. Getting early momentum with creators is vital for attracting new viewers to the Spotlight experience and these investments have helped Spotlight grow to over 100 million monthly active users in January. Our product and ranking teams have been able to quickly improve our ability to match Spotlight viewers with the right content and we are now working on a broader rollout of Spotlight to our entire community. Our commitment to reinventing the camera is most evident through our advances in augmented reality. Today, more than 200 million people engage with AR on Snapchat every day on average. We have co-developed our vision for augmented reality together with our growing community and have created cutting-edge tools and capabilities that allow creators to build increasingly advanced lenses and distribute them to the entire Snapchat community. We are inspired everyday by the creativity of our creator community who have made over 1.5 million lenses using Lens Studio across a growing variety of use cases. For example, during a year when physical gatherings were difficult for many, AR remains integral to empowering Snapchatters self-expression, creativity and connectivity with loved ones during the holidays. For Diwali this year, many lenses leveraged new body tracking and segmentation capabilities, so people could spry on best of stories in AR. Our community played with Diwali theme lenses more than 500 million times, more than 8 times the engagement of our Diwali lenses last year. We are particularly excited about the ways that AR is evolving beyond self-expression, communication and entertainment. For example, our beauty partners have been accelerating their investments in virtual discovery and trial on experiences in response to the COVID pandemic. The Estee Lauder Companies brands, two faced cosmetics launched an eye makeup tutorial lens through Lens Studio. The Lens overlays each step of makeup application in augmented reality and can be activated anytime by scanning the product's packaging. The brand's lens organically, grew to become one of our top-performing lenses with millions of people using it to learn about the product. Other examples include NYX Professional Makeup's virtual store they created in Lens Studio where people can walk around and explore their products in AR. In addition to promoting this experience on their Snapchat brand profile, they're also leveraging Camera Kit to distribute their Lens to partners like Triller. We are doubling down on our solutions for beauty with our partnership with Perfect Corp which will enable hundreds of makeup brands to seamlessly create high quality makeup AR experiences. Beauty is just one of the many areas where we see opportunities to provide valuable utility through augmented reality. We are excited to continue investing in experiences like trying on clothes, visualizing products in your home, learning about the items and locations around you and so much more. We're excited about the progress we're making in collaboration with our partners on games, minis and Snap Kit. For example, Voodoo revamped one of its most popular games Aquapark, so Snapchatters can play in real-time with their friends on Snapchat, complete with in-game Bitmojis. TurboVote supported our Gen Z and millennial audience during the 2020 election with its voter registration mini, which helped register more than 1.2 million US Snapchatters. We recently launched an integration with Twitter using Creative Kit where Twitter users can share tweets directly through Snap's and Stories on Snapchat. Bitmoji kit helps personalize user experiences through people's beloved avatars whether on the Samsung default keyboard or when you're spending money on Venmo. We are now powering AR experiences on other apps through Camera Kit, further expanding the opportunity of Lens Studio. In just the past two years since our first partner summit, we have launched several new capabilities and thousands of successful partner integrations and we look forward to continuing this momentum, as we expand our platform. Looking forward, we are focused on continuing our disciplined execution on both our short and long-term goals for growing our business. We plan to make additional progress on profitability and free cash flow, accelerate our full-year revenue growth beyond the 46% year-over-year growth achieved in 2020 and grow our community around the world by improving and localizing the Snapchat product experience. We are also reorganizing our product team around the five core platforms on Snapchat; Map, Communication, Camera, Stories, and Spotlight which we believe will drive increase focus and operational excellence, as we transition each platform into a monetizable business. We successfully made that transition with stories which we monetized with full-screen vertical video ads and with our camera where businesses can pay to promote their lenses. All of our platforms shared the same powerful monetization infrastructure, which drives strong ROI for our advertising partners. In time, we look forward to creating new ways for businesses to reach customers on our map, engage with their customers using Minis and games and chat and extend the reach of their video campaigns on Spotlight. Lastly, we see a tremendous opportunity to innovate in e-commerce, which to date has been largely driven by utilitarian benefits such as price, selection and convenience. As we have learned from our progress and providing new ways for people to try on and interact with products using augmented reality, improvements in the shopping experience to make it more entertaining and immersive can lead to powerful downstream results in terms of conversion. We plan to experiment rapidly and plant many seeds because we see this opportunity as very large and still very early in terms of maturity despite the massive step change in adoption, due to the global pandemic. This year has shown us that there is nothing more important than the people we share our lives with. As the global health crisis is addressed and the world begins to reopen, we see opportunities to help strengthen the bonds of the Snapchat community all over the world and are committed to making sure Snap continues to play a positive and constructive role in people's lives. I look forward to speaking with many of you in a few weeks at our first-ever Investor Day when you'll have the chance to meet more of our extraordinary team. Until then take care and stay safe. I'll now turn it over to Jeremi to share more about our business. Thanks Ross, for the question on Spotlight, we're very pleasantly surprised with the momentum Spotlight but admittedly, I think we start with some great raw ingredients, meaning we have such a widely used camera with over 5 billion snaps made every day, and incredibly creative community and of course, a really large audience that loves watching mobile content. So, maybe we should have expected it, but so far it's really often the races with over 175,000 video submissions every day, and an audience of over 100 million people in January. So, really excited with the early momentum, and we now that we have both sides of the marketplace, meaning the content submissions and the audience, we can do a lot of work to optimize our ranking and make sure we're doing a good job with content understanding, serving the right content to the right people based on their interest. So lots of opportunity ahead and the team is making great progress really quickly growing engagement on that product. So really excited about where we're at with that. Thanks rick. We're so excited about what's happening with Bitmoji and the team has been doing such an incredible job driving towards their vision of being the world's avatar, we've got a couple of focus areas for Bitmoji. One of them is just involving the avatars themselves, the avatar style. We've been investing a lot in 3D, which enables use in much more sophisticated games. So that's been a big focus of ours and of course making a lot easier for people to express themselves with their avatar that means improving the Bitmoji editor adding new fashion brands and partners like Ralph Lauren that Jeremy mentioned earlier. And of course trying to improve and strengthen the Avatar bond, the bond that people have with their Bitmoji which we do through partnerships. So for example, the integration of Bitmoji with the Samsung keyboard. So, we're going to continue pushing forward on those fronts. We certainly see opportunity for monetization longer term. But frankly, the opportunity is just still so large and so early that we're going to invest in improving avatar themselves and really increasing their utility interestingly one example that we saw recently was game developer that integrated their Bitmoji into their games so radically reduced conversion costs and customer acquisition, which had then allowed them to monetize their game at a higher rate. And so that's a really cool example where we're extending Bitmoji into partner games and services adding a lot of value for the partner and of course, adding value for our community because they feel so strongly about their relationship with the Bitmoji that are excited to play a game really as themselves. So that's definitely a great opportunity for us looking forward, and then when it comes to the Map, I think it is probably important just maybe breakout the SMB opportunity into two sort of different maybe categories; one, in our digital native smaller businesses and they're really trying to grow with things like our dynamic product ads or goal-based bidding, which we have our pixel integration for but if we look at local businesses, there definitely is an opportunity longer term on the Map. We started just by making sure the businesses can be easily discovered on the Map today and we're really focused on adding actions around those businesses. So right now you can place an order or find directions, make a reservation, you can share with your friends and we're going to continue to build engagement around businesses on the Map and over time will be able, I think to convert that into another monetizable surface for Snap. So, as with all of our platforms, we really just try to create value for our community to build that engagement and then over time think about converting that into a business. Thanks for the question. That's a great question. Thanks so much. So I think first and foremost huge credit to our engineering and product teams and of course all the folks working on our data platform and whatnot, who have gotten so good. They are really understanding what's happening on our platform, being able to test and iterate on big changes that we're making and they've just done an outstanding job allowing us to continue to move really quickly and try really big ideas without being disruptive to the platform overall. So, really all the credit goes to the team on that one and what we're excited about is now that we've built that muscle and we've demonstrated that we can move really quickly on these big changes that frees us up to try new things. And that combined with these platform investments in iOS for example, more recently, where we have improved the architecture on the client itself similar to how we approached some of the challenges we faced on Android, those changes also allow us to move faster. So, we've got this combination out really deep understanding of what's happening on our platform, the ability to test, really, really quickly and a new architecture that allows us to move faster both on the front end and the back end. So, overall just really can't thank the team enough for all their hard work there and it shows that we're going to be able to move a lot faster and innovate in the future. And then separately, when we look at Spotlight we're super excited. So far, it looks like a lot of that engagement is incremental and that really speaks to the new layout of the service around the action bar which allows people to easily access different parts of the platform and that doesn't totally surprise me because Spotlight fills a really different need than Stories for example that allow you to catch up with your closest friends and really see the world from their perspective. So as we look at Spotlight that content, it's really the best of Snapchat and people are submitting the snaps that are the funniest or most engaging or most interesting. So I definitely think that content fills a really different need for our community, and we're excited about the engagement we're seeing so far. On the DAU question, we're really excited about the momentum we're continuing to see in the United States. I think a lot of this has to do with the large investments we've made in underlying technology platform form over the last several years. In addition to a lot of fantastic innovation around things like augmented reality and of course Spotlight. So, we're going to continue to differentiate our products, do our best to really serve the needs of our community. And I think we're still at the early stages of our growth given how powerful visual communication is, young people in particular prefer to communicate visually, and increasingly, we're seeing people embrace visual communication as their preferred method. So well, a lot of opportunity in front of us there, and thankfully, a lot of these investments we've made over the last few years are paying off. Yes. So I think as it pertains to the monetization timing on Spotlight, it's still really early. We're going to focus on growing engagement. But fortunately, we've got a lot of demand for our vertical video, which is the format we will use to monetize Spotlight and of course, all the underlying advertising infrastructure. So I think Spotlight will be a great way for folks to extend their video campaigns, but again, we're focused on the product experience today and we'll think about testing a little bit further down the road. And then as it pertains to Discover we've been doing a lot here, especially on content supply. So really trying to understand what sort of content is resonating with our community, where the gaps are in terms of different demographics and interest, making sure that we can meet that demand with the requisite supply and then taking a couple of big bets around compelling new shows for our community, because we see that there is really a lack of investment in premium mobile video and that's an area where we can - we can really grow. So I think overall, we're just able to use a lot of our understanding of our audience to think about where to make content investments and improved supply either with original content or through syndication and of course, with our partners. Jeremi might be better positioned to talk about how our positioning is resonating with advertisers, I know she's having a lot of conversations with our partners. But I think just broadly speaking, when it comes to some of the policy changes that Apple is making. We really think of them as high integrity folks and we're happy to see them making the right decision for their customers. So, of course, this is in line with how we've been thinking about building our business since the beginning, we really innovated and I think we'll continue to innovate. So this is really an opportunity to work together with our partners, work together with Apple and really move forward in a way that benefits everyone in particular consumers who deserve to be protected."

With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Evan.\nEvan Spiegel: Hi everyone, and thank you for joining our call. We added 11 million daily active users this quarter for a total of 249 million, up 4% quarter-over-quarter and 18% year-over-year, demonstrating the benefits of years of investment in our product and partnerships across a wide range of geographies. We generated $679 million in revenue this quarter, up 52% year-over-year, outperforming our expectations and highlighting the substantial value we drive to both direct response and brand advertisers during this continued period of uncertainty. Our year-over-year growth rates for both daily active users and revenue were higher this quarter than they were in Q3 of the prior year. In fact, they represent our highest Q3 growth rates since 2017. Our success underscores the excitement that our community and our advertising partners have around our innovative products and services. The adoption of augmented reality has happened faster than we had previously imagined, and we feel well positioned to execute on the many opportunities that lie ahead. Two years ago, we transformed our business by relentlessly focusing our attention on delivering return on investment for advertisers and building new products and experiences to serve our community. The revenue and community growth we have generated as a result of these efforts has afforded us the opportunity to double down and innovate even more, especially around our camera and augmented reality platform. The creative and technical teams at Snap have worked hard to support Lens Studio creators, and evolve our camera\u2019s capacity to entertain our community and help our partners grow their businesses. For example, this quarter we introduced more Lenses for try-on and commerce, with Sally Hansen creating AR trial and purchase for nail polish, and Champs doing the same for sneakers. Snapchat community engagement is strong, as we continue to grow in new markets, broaden our product offerings, and improve our underlying infrastructure. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of more than 15% year-over-year daily active user growth. We also saw strong retention in our vast community, and we continue to reach over 90% of the Gen Z population and 75% of the Gen Z and millennial population in countries like the U.S., the UK, and France. One key driver of growth across all of our markets has been product innovation and infrastructure improvements. Following the successful rebuild of our Android application last year, we are rolling out a newly streamlined messaging infrastructure that we expect will make messaging faster and more efficient, which will help drive increased engagement, especially as we expand our community across different countries and devices. These foundational investments in our core architecture have also enabled us to innovate faster and release new product features at a rapid pace. In the last year alone, we launched Brand Profiles, Minis, Places on the Map, Dynamic Ads, Bidded AR Lenses, Dynamic Lenses, Camera Kit, Snap ML Lenses, and new creative tools with lots more to come. We are currently rolling out a new five-tab navigation bar for Snapchat, which allows us to deepen the product experience for our Map and Discover platforms. We\u2019re excited to make the Snap Map more visible to new Snapchatters and invest in a better content experience for Discover, especially as we broaden our content offerings across popular creators and professional studios. Our ability to launch a large-scale fundamental product transformation like this quickly and without disruption to our business is evidence of the progress we\u2019ve made. In fact, it was the first major update where we prototyped and launched on Android first due to the structural improvements we made to our Android application last year. Our investments in Lens Studio continue to drive the growth of our augmented reality platform, and we are especially excited to see Lenses created by our community driving a majority of the year-over-year growth in daily Lens views. Our Lens Studio platform allows people all over the world to create rich AR experiences that highlight the broad range of cultures represented by our community. Some of these Lenses are used by Snapchatters across the world, while others are notable for their extraordinary regional engagement. For example, a university student in India created a Lens with a \u2018smoke flare effect which went viral in India and Southeast Asia, garnering billions of views on Snapchat and even more on other social platforms. This demonstrates the impact of the creativity of our community, which empowers self-expression with augmented reality at a volume and scale we could never achieve on our own. We\u2019ve also continued to invest in the technology that underlies our AR platform to empower new experiences for our community. We drew on several years of technical investment and creative experience to launch a number of extremely popular Lenses this quarter. For example, our recently launched Anime Lens uses our Snap ML technology to turn people into anime characters in real time and our community engaged with this Lens 3 billion times in its first week. As we push the envelope on what is possible in augmented reality with these new Lenses, we are even more excited to contribute these new learnings and capabilities to Lens Studio, so our community can leverage them in their own creations. Our content platform continues to mature following our investments in regionalized content and the expansion of our partnerships with both traditional media partners and newer mobile-focused content studios. Our premium Shows format continues to grow rapidly around the world, with time spent watching Shows increasing more than 50% this quarter compared to Q3 of last year. Our successful VS The World docuseries franchise launched its second season featuring Conor McGregor, and has already reached 14 million viewers. Additionally, large media companies continue to find success bringing their top linear TV shows to Snapchat to reach our differentiated audience. Over 50 million Snapchatters watch content derived from TV on Snapchat each month on average, and this familiar programming has helped drive an 80% year-over-year increase in the average number of people watching Shows every day that are over the age of 35. Additionally, as various sports leagues are resuming their seasons, our community has turned to Snap to watch the action. Last month, more than 40% of the U.S. Gen Z population watched premium sports content on Snap. The NBA highlights channel saw over 20% more engagement so far this season than last year, and SportsCenter viewership on Snapchat increased by 80% from July to September. We are also seeing dramatic growth in content engagement in markets like India, where Discover viewership grew nearly 50% quarter-over-quarter. Furthermore, in markets like France and the UK, young people turn to Discover as their destination for premium mobile content, with more than two thirds of the Gen Z and millennial population in both markets watching premium content on Discover. Finally, as our content business develops, we are also providing our partners with better monetization. This quarter, due to growth in Shows and improved monetization, we paid our partners 85% more than we did in Q3 of last year. In addition to AR and content, we are also building new ways to empower creators, developers, brands, and others to improve the entire Snapchat experience for our community. For example, we have partnered with TurboVote to launch a Snap Mini to help our Gen Z and millennial audience register for the upcoming U.S. election. Over 1 million U.S. users have signed up for the Mini, where they can get help registering to vote. According to Democracy Works, more than 50% are likely first-time voters. Additionally, we are continuing to make early progress on our gaming platform by launching three new games this quarter. Many of our early developers are deepening their investment as they explore new genres, monetization models, and game types. For example, Mojiworks, developer of the popular \u2018Ready Chef Go\u2019, is doubling down on the Snap Games opportunity and exploring new genres like music and trivia. We have also been working hard to help our developers find financial success on our platform, and have more than doubled the revenue our developers are generating this quarter compared to Q3 last year. As we look to the future, we believe that the fundamental changes we made to our products and business over the past two years have put us in a strong position to continue executing in a rapidly evolving world. Our improvements to both our core product infrastructure and our internal team and operations have enabled us to accelerate the velocity of our product innovation. Meanwhile, our deep investments in building a scalable advertising platform have allowed us to focus more of our attention on these big future opportunities. We are so excited about our progress in AR, content, and our growing platform, especially as we look to build on our momentum in these areas going forward. Thanks again for joining the call. I\u2019ll hand it over to Jeremi to talk about our business.\nJeremi Gorman: Thank you, Evan. We delivered strong results this quarter and we\u2019re even more excited about the opportunities ahead of us. In Q3, we generated total revenue of $679 million, an increase of 52% year-over-year. The strength in our business reflects the deliberate and structurally sound investments we have made in our ad platform, ad products, and team. We remained nimble and responded to the difficult and rapidly changing macro conditions by supporting our advertising partners in achieving their business goals. We saw the beginnings of a recovery from brand advertisers and continued resilience from direct response advertisers, reinforcing our confidence in the long-term positioning of our business. As brands and other organizations used this period of uncertainty as an opportunity to evaluate their advertising spend, we saw many brands look to align their marketing efforts with platforms who share their corporate values. This gave us an opportunity to engage with advertisers and agencies in real time to ensure that our existing partners as well as new prospects understood our offering in relation to our values. Our sales teams were able to hold many productive C-level conversations to discuss our brand safety positioning and privacy-by-design principles, which provided an opportunity for us to prove our efficacy and ability to scale. We implemented a strategy to ensure advertisers investing in Snap found early and sustained success on our platform as they scaled with us, and we believe that the customer service our teams provided, the alignment on our brand safety principles, and the strong ROI that our advertising partners achieved all contributed to our growth this quarter. As businesses adapted and began to look for opportunities to increase their marketing budgets in Q3, we were pleased to see existing advertisers resume and even increase their budgets, as well as new advertisers allocate spend to drive real business value via our self-serve ad platform. The success we saw in our business in Q3 is the result of many long-term investments we have made to improve our sales and marketing functions, drive ROI through measurement, relevance, and optimization, and build innovative ad experiences through video and AR. It was our continued focus on these three priorities, along with our unique reach and growing global audience, which allowed us to accelerate our growth as more of the world opened up and brands returned to marketing. Across all sectors and verticals, brands are leveraging our millennial and Gen Z audience to reach new customers around the globe. In the U.S., UK, and France, we reach over 75% of 13 to 34 year olds, and we are making progress on growing our reach in other priority markets. To help advertisers better understand the Snapchat Generation, in August we launched our first-ever, global business-to-business marketing campaign, showcasing the values and behaviors that characterize our community. Through our research, we have substantiated that the Snapchat Generation is deeply purpose-driven. We found that over 80% of Snapchatters in the U.S. believe they have a personal responsibility to create positive change in the world, and they are more likely than non-Snapchatters to buy from brands which support local communities. Overall, the B2B campaign was received positively by our advertising partners and has allowed our teams to engage more productively with marketing executives at leading consumer brands as we help businesses learn how to communicate with the Snapchat Generation. We continued to add deep domain expertise under our verticalized sales model, allowing us to effectively serve advertisers of all types and sizes. This structure provided us with the flexibility to pivot resources this quarter to some of our fastest growing verticals including CPG, Streaming, Tech, Telco, Financial Services, and e-commerce. As an example, brands such as Pepsico, MGM, HiSmile, Starling Bank, and Depop as well as agency partners, Publicis and 360i, participated in our B2B marketing campaign where they provided testimonials around the positive results they achieved while partnering with our team. In addition, to support our partners through the pandemic and improve our marketing efforts, we launched Snap Focus, an online learning course for advertisers looking to create their first ad campaign on Snapchat, and Snap Connect, a new marketing program to educate global marketers about direct response advertising on Snapchat. Combined with our webinars and education sessions, our sales and marketing teams have continued to scale and serve our partners in this virtual environment. We continue to invest heavily in ranking, optimization, and measurement in order to deliver measurable ROI for our advertising partners. It was our investments in our self-serve ad platform and our ability to service our customers during a challenging time that allowed us to onboard a record number of advertisers this quarter. Ultimately, all advertisers set their budgets based on performance, be it brand affinity, purchases, or app downloads, and we continue to prove the efficacy of our ad platform by helping our advertising partners achieve their goals. E-commerce remains an exciting opportunity for us and we are doubling down on our efforts in this area. We are taking a holistic approach to e-commerce across sales, native commerce products, and ad tech, including our self-serve tools, lower-funnel optimization goals, and video ad formats. For example, last quarter we launched Dynamic Ads globally, which combine product catalogs with our optimization capabilities to reward advertisers who invest in our platform with ROI at scale, and we are already seeing strong adoption rates from Retail, CPG, Restaurant, and Gaming verticals, among others. More brands have pivoted in this direction, including Sephora investing in Dynamic Ads as a part of their long-term strategy, and Techstyle optimizing for their Fabletics Women\u2019s marketing campaign with pixel purchase optimizations. The rise of mobile content consumption, especially on mobile-native premium formats, presents us with a growing opportunity. The first building block was Discover, our video content business which we launched in 2015. We continue to invest heavily in video advertising through Commercials our nonskippable, full-screen video ad unit, and Snap Select, which enables buying of Commercials in prepackaged, fixed-price, premium inventory. First Commercial, which gives advertisers a way to reserve the first Commercial a Snapchatter sees during a Show, is now available to all advertisers in our Ads Manager following our beta launch last quarter, and we have already seen many advertisers from different verticals invest in this format. For example, we saw Entertainment brands such as NBCUniversal\u2019s Peacock invest in our First Commercial format as the world shifted to direct-to-consumer viewership and theatrical releases were put on pause. We believe augmented reality is the future of immersive customer experiences like try-on, catalog browsing, and showrooming. We invested heavily in our self-serve AR tools to provide advertisers with what they need to create, manage, and optimize an augmented reality campaign that drives measurable ROI. While this form of advertising is still nascent, we are encouraged by the early adoption we are seeing from advertisers. This quarter alone, we partnered with several leading consumer brands, such as Champs Sports, Clearly, Essie, Kohl\u2019s, Levi\u2019s, Jordan Brand, Sally Hansen, and Hoka One One, to leverage our AR and machine learning technologies to power virtual try-on experiences. While Dynamic Ads recommends items to Snapchatters based on their interests, AR try-on takes this a step further and allows Snapchatters to visualize the item in real life. For example, Clearly, an eyewear retailer, leveraged our sponsored AR Lenses to enable our community to try on different pairs of glasses, which resulted in 33 seconds of average playtime and a 5.3% share rate. Clearly was able to drive a full funnel impact for their brand, achieving a 7-point lift in brand awareness and 5-point lift in brand consideration while also driving a 46% lift in unique page viewers on their site and a 3.3% lift in purchases. Longer-term, we believe our Map represents an exciting opportunity to innovate and provide new experiences for our community and to grow revenue. We recently added Places to our Map, which helps people learn more about the businesses around them and view hours and store reviews. We also built a dedicated Local Ads objective to Ads Manager to ease the sign up flow for local businesses. Since its launch in July, we have been encouraged by the number of local businesses experimenting with the product. Though it\u2019s still early, building connections between our community and the places they visit will be instrumental in supporting local advertising in the future. Our investments in our self-serve platform, verticalized sales teams, and engaging ad experiences provide the tools necessary for advertisers to reach our valuable community. While the foundation is in place, we have a huge opportunity to scale our business as we continue to demonstrate measurable ROI for our partners, educate businesses on our unique reach, all while leading the way with innovative, digital-first ad products. In particular, e-commerce remains a focus area as we look to build upon the early momentum of our newer offerings. Longer-term, we believe Snapchatters will engage naturally with businesses of all sizes across our service, whether that be engaging with a brand\u2019s profile, finding store hours on the Map, or interacting with products using an AR Lens. Overall, this was a productive quarter for our business, and we look forward to building on our momentum as we progress toward our short-term and long-term opportunities. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Derek.\nDerek Andersen: Thanks Jeremi. Our Q3 financial results reflect our priorities of growing our community, making focused investments in the future of our business, and scaling our operations efficiently in order to drive towards profitability and positive free cash flow. As Evan mentioned earlier, our community grew to 249 million daily active users in Q3, an increase of 39 million or 18% year-over-year, which exceeded our expectations entering the quarter and represents an acceleration over the prior quarter growth rate. The growth in our community continues to be broad based, with year-over-year and sequential growth on both iOS and Android platforms. In North America, DAU grew by 6 million or 7% year-over-year to reach 90 million. In Europe, DAU grew by 7 million or 10% to reach 72 million. In Rest of World, DAU grew by 26 million or 43% to reach 87 million. We believe Snapchat is a complement to real friendships, and the easing of COVID-19 related restrictions in many communities was a modest tailwind to engagement as we moved through Q3. We observed that restrictions were lifted earlier in Europe and this contributed in part to the higher growth rate in this region relative to North America. The acceleration of growth in Rest of World reflects the benefit of our ongoing investments to better serve our community including investments in local content, language support, marketing partnerships, the popularity of augmented reality Lenses created by our community, and changing competitive dynamics. Total revenue for Q3 was $679 million, an increase of 52% year-over-year, representing a 35 percentage point acceleration over the prior quarter. We benefited from an operating environment that exceeded our expectations entering the quarter as many of the potential headwinds we noted on our last call did not fully materialize. In addition, the auditing of social media platforms by many advertisers and agencies, which occurred throughout the summer, was ultimately constructive towards building and expanding our relationships with many of these advertising partners. These favorable operating conditions led to rapid growth in demand from our brand advertising partners, that built on top of the already strong growth trajectory of our direct response business, and together contributed to record high active advertisers and revenues in the quarter. While we were pleasantly surprised by the favorable operating environment in Q3, we were not surprised by the growth we delivered under these conditions. We demonstrated early in Q1 that our platform is capable of delivering growth over 50% under more normal operating conditions, and we were pleased to see operating conditions significantly improve in Q3. In North America, revenue grew 56% year-over-year in Q3, while ARPU grew 46% year-over-year. In Europe, revenue grew 49% year-over-year in Q3, while ARPU grew 36% year-over-year. The relatively higher rates of growth in North America and Europe in Q3 reflect the ramp in demand from brand advertisers beginning relatively earlier and stronger in these regions. In Rest of World, revenue grew 35% year-over-year in Q3, while ARPU declined 6% year-over-year as accelerating growth in DAU modestly outpaced growth in absolute advertising demand. Rest of World revenue growth accelerated by 21 percentage points over the prior quarter, as demand has begun to recover from the relatively more severe impact of COVID-19 related disruptions to demand in this region. As we noted previously, ARPU in Rest of World is best viewed as an output metric at this stage given the simultaneous rapid growth in our community and advertising demand. We continue to see strong adoption of our ad products. Revenue from our Commercials ad product more than doubled year-over-year in Q3 as we continue to see building demand from advertisers seeking to reach Gen Z and millennial audiences at scale, and with a full screen video advertising product that is delivered adjacent to brand safe content. In addition, our revenue from Camera products nearly doubled year-over-year in Q3 driven by strong adoption of our self-serve Reach and Frequency Lenses and Filters that offer brands an opportunity to interact with Snapchatters through engaging augmented reality experiences. For the first time as a public company, we observed a rise in overall eCPM in Q3, driven by a combination of mix shift towards higher eCPM products such as Commercials, as well as a rapid rise in overall demand. Average eCPMs increased 20% year-over-year. However, we believe our eCPMs remain well below market rates for our audiences and ad units. The ongoing growth of our community, as well as deepening engagement within our app, continues to add more inventory opportunity to our ecosystem over time. In addition, we continue to make improvements to our targeting and optimization capabilities that allow us to show more relevant ads to Snapchatters and utilize our inventory more efficiently. For example, while eCPMs for inventory monetized via Pixel Verified Purchases rose by 71% sequentially in Q3, the cost per purchase for our advertising partners rose by just 1% over the same period. Consequently, we believe that we will be able to deliver attractive returns on ad spend to our advertising partners as eCPM grows over the long term. Gross margins were 58% in Q3, up 7 percentage points year-over-year. We continue to make significant progress against our goal of driving down our underlying infrastructure unit costs over time. In Q3, our efficiency improvements fully offset the year-over-year increase in user activity, resulting in infrastructure costs per DAU of $0.70. On the content side, we have been doubling down on our investments in premium content and we were pleased to see that these investments drove a more than 50% year-over-year increase in total daily time spent watching Shows in Q3, which contributed to our ability to grow revenue, ARPU, and eCPMs at the rates we observed in Q3. The focus on scaling our infrastructure costs efficiently has allowed us to make these investments in premium content, while continuing to expand our gross margins, which reflects our overall approach of scaling our operations efficiently while making investments in the future of our business. Operating expenses were $338 million in Q3, up 24% year-over-year, and in line with the estimates we shared on our prior call. Full time headcount grew at a rate roughly in line with the growth in operating expenses as we continued to make focused investments in our monetization and engineering teams. In addition, we continued to grow our investments in marketing in order to build on the momentum we have established with our advertising and Snapchatter communities. We continued to invest in the long-term health of our business, even as the operating environment became more challenging earlier this year, and we believe that the growth we observed in our community and in our top line in Q3 have validated this approach. Q3 marked our second quarter of adjusted EBITDA profitability at $56 million for the quarter, an improvement of $99 million year-over-year, and $152 million over the prior quarter. In Q3, we delivered adjusted EBITDA leverage of 42% as we continue to invest in the future of our business, while making progress towards profitability and positive free cash flow. Net income was negative $200 million in Q3, an improvement of $28 million over the prior year, and $126 million over the prior quarter. The year-over-year improvement in net income reflects the flow through of improved adjusted EBITDA, offset by the impact of interest expense related to the convertible notes issued over the past year, and higher stock-based compensation. While we have continued to grow our team, stock-based compensation declined on a per capita basis in Q3 as our team continues to migrate towards sustainable and competitive compensation structures that we have put in place in the years following our IPO. Total fully diluted shares outstanding grew 4% year-over-year in Q3, flat from the prior quarter and down from 6% in the same quarter of last year. We consider careful management of our stock-based compensation program to be a key input to efficiently managing our fully diluted shares outstanding as we seek to build shareholder value over the long term. Free cash flow for Q3 was negative $70 million, an improvement of $15 million year-over-year, primarily driven by the improvements in adjusted EBITDA that were partially offset by changes in net working capital. We ended the quarter with $2.7 billion in cash and marketable securities, up from $2.3 billion in the prior year as the proceeds of convertible notes issued in Q2 more than offset the investments we have made to grow the business over the past year. Similar to last quarter, we do not intend to provide financial guidance for Q4, but we do want to share some perspective on how we believe the quarter might unfold. While we have benefitted from an improving operating environment in recent months, we are conscious that external factors, similar to those that produced more volatile operating conditions earlier this year, could emerge and impact our momentum. In addition, advertising demand in Q4 has historically been bolstered by the holiday season in the latter portion of the quarter, and it is not clear at this time whether that key source of advertising demand will materialize in the same way this year as in prior years. Assuming that the current favorable operating conditions persist, and that the holiday season materializes in line with what we have experienced in prior years, we believe that year-over-year revenue growth of 47% to 50% is attainable in Q4. On the expense side, we intend to continue to invest in the long term growth of our business, and are currently contemplating incremental investments to double down on the momentum we have established. Consequently, we expect that year-over-year expense growth is likely to be higher in Q4 than we have observed year-to-date. While there is continued uncertainty about the macro operating environment, we are pleased with the strength of the underlying momentum we have established with our advertising partners, and we remain highly optimistic about the long term prospects for our business. In addition, we are pleased with the growth trends we have observed in our Snapchatter community and believe that momentum will continue into Q4 with DAU of approximately 257 million, implying year-over-year growth of approximately 18%, which is consistent with the growth rate observed in Q3. Thank you for joining our call today, and we will now take your questions.\nOperator: That concludes the prepared remarks for today\u2019s earnings call, and we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Ross Sandler of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRoss Sandler: Great. Thanks. Evan, you mentioned that you\u2019re starting to roll out features on Android first before iOS. That seems like a pretty big milestone for you guys in terms of where the Android stack is. So, I guess, how is faster product development on the Android side impacting your thinking on retaining and growing the audience in international? Is that where some of the 10 million of ROW users came from? And then, Derek, one on the guidance. So, just on the math for July and then what you did in the quarter, it would imply that you\u2019re growing 60%-ish over the last couple of months. So, is the comment about 47% to 50% growth in the fourth quarter reflective of the mix up of brand advertising, or anything else you would call out in terms of why you are expecting that to drop out, or drop off a little bit, would be helpful? Thank you.\nEvan Spiegel: Thanks, Ross. We\u2019re really pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made on Android. We\u2019ve certainly learned a lot from our prior mistakes, and the client is in a much better place and has allowed us to experiment and iterate a lot more quickly on the Android platform. We do still see some upside in the back-end improvements we\u2019re making. So, we\u2019re working a lot on improving our messaging infrastructure, for example. And that\u2019s been rolling out and really helps just improve the speed of communication, which we think can have a positive impact on engagement. So, overall, big changes to the clients on Android, more changes coming on the back-end. And then we\u2019re trying to do the same thing on iOS now. iOS was in a better place to start with. But, we really believe that we can continue to improve the iOS architecture. We\u2019ve got a big initiative underway there across the entire company, which should allow us to move at a similar pace to Android because believe it or not, we can actually move faster on Android now than iOS. So, huge change. Obviously, we\u2019re really excited about it. And certainly, it\u2019s vital when we\u2019re thinking about unlocking growth in markets that are dominated by Android.\nDerek Andersen: Hey Ross, it\u2019s Derek speaking. I\u2019ll take the second part of the question. Thank you. Yes, as we look forward, we\u2019re really pleased with what we saw in terms of growth as we moved through Q3. We started a little slower at the beginning of that quarter, but we\u2019ve enjoyed nicely elevated growth levels since August and through the quarter. Now, as I look to Q4, one of the unique things about Q4 is that the revenue tends to be more back-ended than other quarters. And so, you want to be a little bit more cautious about drawing too many inferences from the early days of Q4, it\u2019s a little bit different from other quarters in the year. But as I mentioned, look, there is obviously the potential for uncertainty in the operating environment. But if we\u2019re able to maintain the positive conditions we\u2019ve seen recently and we see a strong holiday season that\u2019s roughly around what we\u2019ve seen in previous periods, we do believe that 47% to 50% range is attainable and wanted to share that, so we could provide at least a little bit of an indication of how we thought the quarter could transpire. So, hopefully, that gives you a little bit more context about what we\u2019re thinking there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the question. You talked about eCPMs increasing for the first time as a public company. I was just hoping you could talk about the drivers here. Curious how much that\u2019s a function of higher value inventory, like Commercials and Snap Select versus option density from a larger number of advertisers? And I\u2019m curious if you have any thoughts on how far below you are versus market rates at this point? Thanks.\nDerek Andersen: Hey Doug, it\u2019s Derek speaking. I\u2019ll take that question. Thank you. And yes, we did enjoy an increase in eCPM there. I think, it\u2019s important to think of that very much as an output metric at this point in our business. One of the things that we look to there is that we\u2019ve seen really robust demand for some of our higher eCPM products. So, there\u2019s mix effects there, as you noted in your question. So, Commercials being a very good example, where we saw revenue from Commercial more than double year-over-year in the most recent quarter, and that certainly contributes to the number. And yes, we\u2019ve seen an overall lift in absolute demand. But we continue to also invest very heavily as we have over the last year in our monetization optimization capabilities, making sure we\u2019re getting the right ad to the right Snapchatter at the right moment. And that contributes to our ability to deliver the actions that advertisers are seeking with fewer impressions. And that has the effect of why -- of raising the output metric of eCPM. But as long as we\u2019re able to continue to drive great optimization, we don\u2019t see a corresponding lift in the cost per action to the advertiser. And I shared in my prepared remarks some metrics around, for example, what we saw with Pixel Verified Purchases. So, we\u2019re going to continue to invest there, but it\u2019s very early days in our monetization and realizing the potential monetization of the business. If you think about our content business first, very early stages there, but we\u2019re pleased with what we\u2019re seeing. And that\u2019s a big driver at the moment and optimization continues to help there. But also, we\u2019re seeing growth in engagement. And I mentioned the 50% year-over-year growth in terms of time spent with Shows, and we continue to invest there alongside the optimization. But a long way to go there to get close to market rates for our ad units and audiences. And then, of course, earlier stage at the Camera side. We\u2019re really pleased with some of the early indications we\u2019re seeing there, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, around the growth in region frequency self-serve Lens products. They nearly doubled year-over-year in the quarter. So, we\u2019ve got good early traction there. And then, of course, we shared recently some of the metrics around the Map and how deep the density is there. And of course, that part of our engagement, we haven\u2019t begun to tap on monetization. So, I think, all of that sort of gives you an indication of just how early we are in realizing the full potential on monetization. And hopefully, that gives you a little more context around some of the specific dynamics on the eCPM in the period.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Levine of Pivotal Research Group. Please go ahead.\nMichael Levine: Thanks for the opportunity, guys. I mean, a question for both Evan and for Jeremi. I mean, Evan, in your prepared remarks, you guys had talked about seeing good growth with respect to sports viewing. I know that that had been an area that Derek had highlighted, wasn\u2019t necessarily going to be a headwind, but you guys didn\u2019t maybe quite know what it looked like. But, as I\u2019m watching what\u2019s happening in the rest of the world of media, the traditional media companies are having just atrocious ratings. And I\u2019m hearing that there\u2019s more dollars that are flowing in from guys who want to do advertise in the games and the inventory doesn\u2019t -- wasn\u2019t just there. So, a couple of questions. One, I am curious, has that actually translated into an incremental tailwind for you guys? And then, probably more for Jeremi, like if we actually have this big unlock of dollars that was going to be allocated to live sports in \u201821, I mean, do you have to make any further investment in the vertical sales efforts, or do you feel like you got those key categories lined up? Thank you so much.\nEvan Spiegel: Thanks for the question. Yes. At a really high level, sports are just deeply interwoven into culture, and they\u2019re really, really important to people, and therefore, they\u2019re very important to our community. So, we worked really hard to think holistically about our sports partnerships across augmented reality, of course, content. Things like Bitmoji and all of that helps people talk about and express themselves in relation to the teams that they really care about. And driving that conversation is obviously really important for the leagues and also for our business. So, we think we can continue to play a role there. It\u2019s obviously really important to our community. And Jeremi can speak to the implications that for advertisers who obviously also really want to associate themselves with sports.\nJeremi Gorman: Yes. Thanks for the question, Michael. And certainly, I cannot let a good sports question go without mentioning how exciting it is for our teams here in Los Angeles, this season in particular. So, we\u2019re all very excited about it over here. As Evan talked about last month, more than 40% of the U.S. Gen Z population watched premium sports content on Snap specifically, and the NBA highlights channel saw over 20% more engagement so far this season than last year. So, that helps speak to the trends. As you know, sports are absolutely highly visible to advertisers who are looking for both, premium content, contextually relevant placements and then large package buys with ourselves and with our partners that are inclusive of things like augmented reality, Bitmoji and others, as Evan mentioned. Our Commercials ad unit is continuing to perform for us. It\u2019s allowed us to increase yield with -- from premium sports content, and we\u2019re really happy with both the audience and the revenue growth on that product. Of course, it\u2019s still early for us, and we\u2019re going to continue to experiment and work with our content partners to bring immersive sports experience to Snapchatters. But in the meantime, go L.A.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nHeath Terry: Great. Thanks. When we look at the acceleration in Rest of World, is there a way that you could disaggregate for us what you feel like is driving that? How much of it is macro versus things that you\u2019ve done with product or even just marketing that you feel like is driving that? And as we think kind of more specifically about what those users might look like longer term, how do you think about sort of the monetization of Rest of World users? What\u2019s their long-term potential as you grow in those markets to monetize relative to say the U.S. or Europe?\nEvan Spiegel: Yes. Thanks for the question. We\u2019re really excited about the momentum we\u2019re seeing internationally. Obviously, a lot of that is following our major investments in things like the Android rewrite, but also our partnerships with telcos and OEMs that have been helpful in driving growth there and just removing friction from using our products. One of the big things that we\u2019re really excited about also is the way that things like augmented reality have really been localized for our community because creators in these different markets are building locally relevant Lenses and then sharing them with all their friends. And so, there\u2019s this really sort of exciting and virtuous cycle that\u2019s happening here where local creators build really compelling AR experiences, share them with the broader community. People make Snaps with those and then share them with their friends or share them on other platforms, which helps support our growth overall. So, I think as we look at localized content, augmented reality and the continued growth of our partners, we\u2019re just really excited about how that\u2019s all coming together. Obviously, it\u2019s been a long road to get here, but we\u2019re excited by what we are seeing.\nJeremi Gorman: And I can take the part of rest of world monetization. So, just to give you an example of what we\u2019re doing here is that we are deploying a strategic hybrid strategy. So, we use resellers in a market, and we\u2019ve done that for many years. We consider them to be extraordinary partners of ours and truly an extension of the Snap team. It\u2019s pretty remarkable to visit these markets and see how well they represent us. It\u2019s been a really exciting journey. But, as engagement grows, certain criteria are met with DAU, we put Snap salespeople on the ground, including account executives, account managers, creative strategists and more. And then, we work alongside our reseller partners to determine which point Snap is going to service directly and which they can -- which the resellers can best supplement. We\u2019re going to continue to deploy this hybrid strategy around the world. It\u2019s working, and we found it successful so far. We look forward to continuing to do that as we grow globally.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rich Greenfield of LightShed Partners. Please go ahead.\nRich Greenfield: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. When you think about advertisers, it seems like you had a real sort of drop in sort of the quality of advertisers that you shifted to programmatic. And I think what Jeremi talked about was this audit that took place over the summer, and it does look like the brands that we\u2019re seeing, whether it\u2019s M&Ms or Verizon Fios or LEGOS or Peacock or Bud lately, it\u2019s incredible how many big brands we\u2019re seeing now on the service. Maybe you could just spend a minute, like what actually happened that this audit took place and all of these brands came back fast? Like what were they looking at? Are these dollars shifting actually from TV? Are you still in sort of a non-TV sort of advertiser bucket? Like, what\u2019s actually happening there? And then I\u2019ve got a couple of follow-ups and housekeeping points.\nJeremi Gorman: Thanks for the question, Rich, and thank you for noticing the quality of the advertisers. You\u2019re right. Our investments in optimization, measurement and ranking are paying off, and big brands as well as our DR brands are finding success. And it\u2019s really exciting for our community who continues to see more and more relevant ads as we add to this demand across the board. Over the past five years actually we\u2019ve been building a powerful video business with the goal of connecting advertisers to the Snapchat Generation. And it\u2019s really getting increasingly difficult to reach this audience on linear television. They are watching TV, it\u2019s just in their pocket. We\u2019ve made several key hires in the area, and our executives most responsible for video monetization have a lot of years of experience in this field. They know their strategy and they know the buyers. Based on the strength of what we\u2019re seeing in our video business, we\u2019re continuing to invest in new products. So, to give you an example of how we\u2019re continuing to capture these budgets more and more incrementally, we recently launched First Commercials, which gives our advertisers the very first ad and the very first product that a Snapchatter sees. And every marketer knows how important it is to make that first impression. Our Commercials are designed for both social video and online video buyers. And the goal is truly to just attract incremental TV budgets into our hand-curated, brand-safe hand-curated content on Discover. So, all of those things coming together after five years of long hard work is what you\u2019re seeing right now. And we\u2019re really excited about the future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nJustin Post: Great. Congrats on a great revenue quarter. I want to maybe focus more on users. First, can you talk more about the COVID impact on North American usage and whether you might be seeing any leakage to entertainment apps, TikTok or YouTube? And second, you mentioned you\u2019re testing the 5-tab navigation bar, which is pretty interesting. Can you talk about, is that increasing usage in your tests to other Snap applications, and what could that do to overall usage? Thank you.\nEvan Spiegel: Yes. Thanks, Justin. As we look at competition more broadly, obviously, entertainment services do compete with the content section of our business. But obviously, the core driver of engagement on Snapchat is communication, and that has been impacted by COVID. In the areas that are more open, like in Europe and whatnot, we see less of an impact. We think some of that is due to the fact that maybe people are making fewer friendships or things like that when they\u2019re stuck in their houses. And that\u2019s one we\u2019re paying attention to. But overall, our audience in the U.S. and in North America is growing. We are seeing some slight shifts in engagement. But, we think that as the U.S. continues to open up following COVID that we\u2019ll return to more normal engagement patterns there. Looking at the 5-tab navigation bar, we\u2019ve learned a lot from some of our prior redesigns. And so, as we look at realizing this big opportunity of breaking out things like the Map and Discover, giving them more prominence in the service, our number one goal is really to do no harm to core engagement. And so, that\u2019s really what we focused on here. What we\u2019re excited about over the longer term obviously is that now we have two new areas to really play and experiment rapidly, and surfacing those areas to our entire community allows us to do that a lot faster. Previously, both Discover and the Map were relatively hidden inside of Snapchat. So, we\u2019re excited about the long-term opportunity. The same way that separating social for media really made a big difference for our business. It took a little while to pay off obviously, but we\u2019ve really seen the long-term impact. So, this is another one of those changes that\u2019s designed to unlock longer-term opportunity. Of course, number one priority is do no harm. But now, we\u2019re really excited to iterate here and to continue to grow those platforms that are so important to us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Please go ahead.\nEric Sheridan: Jeremi, maybe if I can direct one to you. You guys started the year with a lot of growth and a big step-up in January and February. And earlier in the year, we talked about sort of an unlock at the agency side and with bigger advertisers as you exit in \u201819 and went into \u201820, and you\u2019ve had a lot of success with direct response this year. Can you just maybe put a finer point on the arc we\u2019ve seen this year against the backdrop of COVID-19 in terms of how you feel you\u2019re positioned with respect to the dialogue with ad agencies, large advertisers? And how sustainable you think some of the depth and advertiser growth you\u2019ve seen this quarter is as we turn the page from 2020 into \u201821? Thanks so much.\nJeremi Gorman: Thanks for the question, Eric. Yes, we are incredibly excited to see that our growth is returning to the levels that we saw at the beginning of the year. So, thank you for making mention of that. To give you more specifics around your question, some of our fastest growing verticals include CPG, streaming, tech, telco, financial services and e-commerce. In particular, e-commerce remains a very exciting opportunity for us. When you start to think of things like AR try-ons, the utility of being able to put shoes on your feet or sunglasses on your face or hats on your head and utilize that for utility-based advertising in AR, we are absolutely doubling down on our efforts in that area. As everybody knows, last quarter, we launched Dynamic Ads globally, and that continues to combine our product catalogs -- or the advertisers\u2019 product catalogs with optimization capabilities to reward advertisers who invest in our platform with ROI at scale. In that particular area, we\u2019re seeing strong adoption rates from retail, CPG and restaurants. And we have been working alongside travel partners, and we are ready for them when the world starts traveling again. But ultimately, we know that all of our advertisers set their budgets based on performance, whether that\u2019s brand affinity, purchases or app downloads. And we\u2019re going to continue to prove the efficacy of our platform and know that we can continue to grow and build budgets. It\u2019s important to note that it was these investments in our self-service ad platform and our ability to service our customers during this challenging time that allowed us to onboard a record number of advertisers this quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my question. I have two, one for Jeremi, one for Evan. Jeremi, so going back to the discussion of what the world looked like in January and February versus August, September. Talk to us about -- so, if you look back in January and February, what did your advertiser vertical mix look like? And are there still large buckets of verticals of advertisers who were material spenders in January and February who are not yet back spending because of macro factors, or is that not something we should be thinking about from a recovery standpoint heading into \u201821? And then, on games, Evan, I wanted to ask you, you guys are doing a good job of sort of starting to blur the lines between social and gaming. Maybe just talk to us about what your multiyear vision is for Snap Gaming and the investments you need to really build out the gaming metaverse? Thanks.\nJeremi Gorman: Sure. Thanks for the question, Brian. As I just mentioned, we are seeing a lot of success with CPG, streaming, tech, telco, financial services and e-commerce, in particular. In terms of large buckets that we had at the beginning of the year that we are no longer seeing a lot of momentum from, it\u2019s not something that we are concerned about. We obviously know that in the macro conditions, there are categories like travel and automotive that are suffering a little bit more given the macro conditions. But, relative to how they fare at Snap, it\u2019s not something that we\u2019re concerned about, because we continue to grow in these other incredible areas that are where people are finding success on the platform. I just talked about e-commerce a little bit. I will continue to put a finer point on that. I can\u2019t say enough about how important that opportunity is for us as it pertains to not only the performance that we\u2019re able to deliver for those advertisers with our great products like Dynamic Ads, but in addition, our ability to really make sure that our goal-based bidding products are serving them with the right ROI. So, we\u2019re going to continue to focus there. And when categories like travel and automotive come back, we will be welcoming them with open arms, and we\u2019re really excited to work with them.\nEvan Spiegel: Thanks for the question on games, something we\u2019re definitely very excited about. I think, the best way to think about it is, there\u2019s a lot of little experiments that we\u2019re running right now. Games are still hidden in chat and so you got to really look for them to play. And so, that allows us to really focus on iterating and building engagement, learning what sort of content works, learning what types of services our developers really need in order to grow games and monetize them and reengage their communities. So, there\u2019s definitely a lot of work to do there. One of the experiments that we\u2019re trying right now that\u2019s pretty fun is around Snap Token. So, that helps our community engage with in-app purchases inside of games, which provides another revenue stream to gaming companies and our partners. And so, really what we\u2019re doing is just listening to our community, listening to our partners and working hard to build the platform. And this is the approach we\u2019ve taken with some of the other platforms we\u2019ve built like content or AR, where we start with a select set of partners and just do our best to listen and learn and iterate until it really clicks. So, lots of exciting things. Some games obviously are doing better than others, and we\u2019re learning from the ones that are working and the ones that aren\u2019t working, and helping our partners pivot and continue to grow engagement around gaming.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Mark Shmulik of Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nMark Shmulik: Yes. Hi. Thank you for taking the question. Evan, you called it at the top of the call that AR traction and adoption is kind of above of expectations. Obviously, we\u2019ve seen the AR virtual try-on pick up some speed in the launch of local Lenses. But how are you now thinking about the road map of where AR goes over the next few years from both, like a user and a monetization perspective? And then, one for Jeremi, if I may. It\u2019s certainly a nice problem now for Snapchat to have with the rapidly growing portfolio of all these new ad products. How are you thinking about making sure that the right ad products get to the right advertiser in this verticalized sales model? Are these some of the changes that were that domain expertise roles that you mentioned earlier, play a role? Thank you.\nEvan Spiegel: Well, as you mentioned, the stars are really aligning on our augmented reality business at the moment, which is super exciting. So, the last five years, we\u2019ve obviously worked very-hard to evolve the technology, and we\u2019ve gotten to a place where we\u2019re capable of some pretty sophisticated rendering, things like Snap ML, for example, like really represent a step change in augmented reality because you go from sort of overlaying 3D graphics on a scene to fundamentally re-rendering reality. And that\u2019s unlocked a lot of really compelling new use cases. Of course, our community, they\u2019re engagement with augmented reality has just exploded over the past few years. So, it\u2019s become really an everyday behavior for Snapchatters, and that\u2019s something that\u2019s really important. But, I think the big change really that\u2019s accelerated with COVID, has been that businesses are coming to the table and really understanding how AR can drive their business. And frankly, I think businesses were just less open to these types of experiments when retail was open and widely accessible and things like that. And so, we\u2019ve just seen a lot of like openness and excitement from brands to try new things and help customers trial their products. Trial is a hugely important part of driving sales in retail. And so, being able to power these trial and experiences, whether that\u2019s shoes or nail polish or beauty products or whatever, and then convert directly to purchase, I think, achieves two goals for businesses. One, of course, it helps them build their brand and things like that, but also it really drives ROI. And so, I think businesses are open-minded to trying ROI and they are open-minded to trying AR, and they\u2019re finding ROI when they do that. And so, that\u2019s really exciting for us. As we look at the next couple of years, there\u2019s still just a massive, massive road map in terms of the overall platform improvements we\u2019re trying to make. That should enable even more deeply engaging AR experiences. So, we\u2019ll be really focused on just building the platform, helping people learn how AR can help them achieve their business goals. But overall, we\u2019re just excited because this change happened faster than we expected. And it\u2019s just exciting to see so many brands playing around with this totally new category.\nJeremi Gorman: Yes. And to follow up on that, yes, we definitely believe that our verticalized sales model has helped us get through this unique time with the macro conditions, in particular, because our teams deeply understand the needs of their advertisers at this time, and there has been no more important time for that to be true. They are studying everything from tariffs to understand the impact on downstream profitability of a particular CPG company, all the way through how many people are passing through TSA every single day to know how its travel is going to be recovering. And they\u2019re doing an extraordinary job. I couldn\u2019t be more proud of the team. To make sure that the right products get to the right advertisers, we\u2019ve launched a lot of B2B marketing efforts, including Snap Focus and Snap Connect, which serve different purposes, one of which is to get the first advertisements going and a second is to continue to grow it. But, as it pertains to the product specifically, you listed a few of them, but you\u2019re right. We couldn\u2019t be more lucky to be in the position to be able to talk about things like Map, shoppable AR, Dynamic Ads, first school-based bidding, globalization of our products and so on. And that team has done an incredible job of launching performance products. We know that our products work better together and they serve different purposes. Video ads, augmented reality, they both reach users, but they put them in different contexts on the app. We\u2019re continuing to see case studies where combining AR with video ad yields better results for the advertisers. And so, there\u2019s lots of opportunity to make our service and products more approachable and easier to use and more performance over time. But for us, the most critical thing is that our video ads, their performance, they\u2019re engaging. And it\u2019s really exciting to see advertisers continuing to invest more and more in our core video ad products. We\u2019re still early in the journey for augmented reality, advertising, as Evan said, but we think we can keep building on our lead here. Derek talked about the success of our self-service AR, and that is really going to lead us to connect all of the innovation happening with our Lens Studio products and our advertising technology set.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session as well as Snap Inc.\u2019s third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Thank you for attending today\u2019s session. And you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks Jeremi. Our Q3 financial results reflect our priorities of growing our community, making focused investments in the future of our business, and scaling our operations efficiently in order to drive towards profitability and positive free cash flow. As Evan mentioned earlier, our community grew to 249 million daily active users in Q3, an increase of 39 million or 18% year-over-year, which exceeded our expectations entering the quarter and represents an acceleration over the prior quarter growth rate. The growth in our community continues to be broad based, with year-over-year and sequential growth on both iOS and Android platforms. In North America, DAU grew by 6 million or 7% year-over-year to reach 90 million. In Europe, DAU grew by 7 million or 10% to reach 72 million. In Rest of World, DAU grew by 26 million or 43% to reach 87 million. We believe Snapchat is a complement to real friendships, and the easing of COVID-19 related restrictions in many communities was a modest tailwind to engagement as we moved through Q3. We observed that restrictions were lifted earlier in Europe and this contributed in part to the higher growth rate in this region relative to North America. The acceleration of growth in Rest of World reflects the benefit of our ongoing investments to better serve our community including investments in local content, language support, marketing partnerships, the popularity of augmented reality Lenses created by our community, and changing competitive dynamics. Total revenue for Q3 was $679 million, an increase of 52% year-over-year, representing a 35 percentage point acceleration over the prior quarter. We benefited from an operating environment that exceeded our expectations entering the quarter as many of the potential headwinds we noted on our last call did not fully materialize. In addition, the auditing of social media platforms by many advertisers and agencies, which occurred throughout the summer, was ultimately constructive towards building and expanding our relationships with many of these advertising partners. These favorable operating conditions led to rapid growth in demand from our brand advertising partners, that built on top of the already strong growth trajectory of our direct response business, and together contributed to record high active advertisers and revenues in the quarter. While we were pleasantly surprised by the favorable operating environment in Q3, we were not surprised by the growth we delivered under these conditions. We demonstrated early in Q1 that our platform is capable of delivering growth over 50% under more normal operating conditions, and we were pleased to see operating conditions significantly improve in Q3. In North America, revenue grew 56% year-over-year in Q3, while ARPU grew 46% year-over-year. In Europe, revenue grew 49% year-over-year in Q3, while ARPU grew 36% year-over-year. The relatively higher rates of growth in North America and Europe in Q3 reflect the ramp in demand from brand advertisers beginning relatively earlier and stronger in these regions. In Rest of World, revenue grew 35% year-over-year in Q3, while ARPU declined 6% year-over-year as accelerating growth in DAU modestly outpaced growth in absolute advertising demand. Rest of World revenue growth accelerated by 21 percentage points over the prior quarter, as demand has begun to recover from the relatively more severe impact of COVID-19 related disruptions to demand in this region. As we noted previously, ARPU in Rest of World is best viewed as an output metric at this stage given the simultaneous rapid growth in our community and advertising demand. We continue to see strong adoption of our ad products. Revenue from our Commercials ad product more than doubled year-over-year in Q3 as we continue to see building demand from advertisers seeking to reach Gen Z and millennial audiences at scale, and with a full screen video advertising product that is delivered adjacent to brand safe content. In addition, our revenue from Camera products nearly doubled year-over-year in Q3 driven by strong adoption of our self-serve Reach and Frequency Lenses and Filters that offer brands an opportunity to interact with Snapchatters through engaging augmented reality experiences. For the first time as a public company, we observed a rise in overall eCPM in Q3, driven by a combination of mix shift towards higher eCPM products such as Commercials, as well as a rapid rise in overall demand. Average eCPMs increased 20% year-over-year. However, we believe our eCPMs remain well below market rates for our audiences and ad units. The ongoing growth of our community, as well as deepening engagement within our app, continues to add more inventory opportunity to our ecosystem over time. In addition, we continue to make improvements to our targeting and optimization capabilities that allow us to show more relevant ads to Snapchatters and utilize our inventory more efficiently. For example, while eCPMs for inventory monetized via Pixel Verified Purchases rose by 71% sequentially in Q3, the cost per purchase for our advertising partners rose by just 1% over the same period. Consequently, we believe that we will be able to deliver attractive returns on ad spend to our advertising partners as eCPM grows over the long term. Gross margins were 58% in Q3, up 7 percentage points year-over-year. We continue to make significant progress against our goal of driving down our underlying infrastructure unit costs over time. In Q3, our efficiency improvements fully offset the year-over-year increase in user activity, resulting in infrastructure costs per DAU of $0.70. On the content side, we have been doubling down on our investments in premium content and we were pleased to see that these investments drove a more than 50% year-over-year increase in total daily time spent watching Shows in Q3, which contributed to our ability to grow revenue, ARPU, and eCPMs at the rates we observed in Q3. The focus on scaling our infrastructure costs efficiently has allowed us to make these investments in premium content, while continuing to expand our gross margins, which reflects our overall approach of scaling our operations efficiently while making investments in the future of our business. Operating expenses were $338 million in Q3, up 24% year-over-year, and in line with the estimates we shared on our prior call. Full time headcount grew at a rate roughly in line with the growth in operating expenses as we continued to make focused investments in our monetization and engineering teams. In addition, we continued to grow our investments in marketing in order to build on the momentum we have established with our advertising and Snapchatter communities. We continued to invest in the long-term health of our business, even as the operating environment became more challenging earlier this year, and we believe that the growth we observed in our community and in our top line in Q3 have validated this approach. Q3 marked our second quarter of adjusted EBITDA profitability at $56 million for the quarter, an improvement of $99 million year-over-year, and $152 million over the prior quarter. In Q3, we delivered adjusted EBITDA leverage of 42% as we continue to invest in the future of our business, while making progress towards profitability and positive free cash flow. Net income was negative $200 million in Q3, an improvement of $28 million over the prior year, and $126 million over the prior quarter. The year-over-year improvement in net income reflects the flow through of improved adjusted EBITDA, offset by the impact of interest expense related to the convertible notes issued over the past year, and higher stock-based compensation. While we have continued to grow our team, stock-based compensation declined on a per capita basis in Q3 as our team continues to migrate towards sustainable and competitive compensation structures that we have put in place in the years following our IPO. Total fully diluted shares outstanding grew 4% year-over-year in Q3, flat from the prior quarter and down from 6% in the same quarter of last year. We consider careful management of our stock-based compensation program to be a key input to efficiently managing our fully diluted shares outstanding as we seek to build shareholder value over the long term. Free cash flow for Q3 was negative $70 million, an improvement of $15 million year-over-year, primarily driven by the improvements in adjusted EBITDA that were partially offset by changes in net working capital. We ended the quarter with $2.7 billion in cash and marketable securities, up from $2.3 billion in the prior year as the proceeds of convertible notes issued in Q2 more than offset the investments we have made to grow the business over the past year. Similar to last quarter, we do not intend to provide financial guidance for Q4, but we do want to share some perspective on how we believe the quarter might unfold. While we have benefitted from an improving operating environment in recent months, we are conscious that external factors, similar to those that produced more volatile operating conditions earlier this year, could emerge and impact our momentum. In addition, advertising demand in Q4 has historically been bolstered by the holiday season in the latter portion of the quarter, and it is not clear at this time whether that key source of advertising demand will materialize in the same way this year as in prior years. Assuming that the current favorable operating conditions persist, and that the holiday season materializes in line with what we have experienced in prior years, we believe that year-over-year revenue growth of 47% to 50% is attainable in Q4. On the expense side, we intend to continue to invest in the long term growth of our business, and are currently contemplating incremental investments to double down on the momentum we have established. Consequently, we expect that year-over-year expense growth is likely to be higher in Q4 than we have observed year-to-date. While there is continued uncertainty about the macro operating environment, we are pleased with the strength of the underlying momentum we have established with our advertising partners, and we remain highly optimistic about the long term prospects for our business. In addition, we are pleased with the growth trends we have observed in our Snapchatter community and believe that momentum will continue into Q4 with DAU of approximately 257 million, implying year-over-year growth of approximately 18%, which is consistent with the growth rate observed in Q3. Thank you for joining our call today, and we will now take your questions. Hey Ross, it's Derek speaking. I'll take the second part of the question. Thank you. Yes, as we look forward, we're really pleased with what we saw in terms of growth as we moved through Q3. We started a little slower at the beginning of that quarter, but we've enjoyed nicely elevated growth levels since August and through the quarter. Now, as I look to Q4, one of the unique things about Q4 is that the revenue tends to be more back-ended than other quarters. And so, you want to be a little bit more cautious about drawing too many inferences from the early days of Q4, it's a little bit different from other quarters in the year. But as I mentioned, look, there is obviously the potential for uncertainty in the operating environment. But if we're able to maintain the positive conditions we've seen recently and we see a strong holiday season that's roughly around what we've seen in previous periods, we do believe that 47% to 50% range is attainable and wanted to share that, so we could provide at least a little bit of an indication of how we thought the quarter could transpire. So, hopefully, that gives you a little bit more context about what we're thinking there. Hey Doug, it's Derek speaking. I'll take that question. Thank you. And yes, we did enjoy an increase in eCPM there. I think, it's important to think of that very much as an output metric at this point in our business. One of the things that we look to there is that we've seen really robust demand for some of our higher eCPM products. So, there's mix effects there, as you noted in your question. So, Commercials being a very good example, where we saw revenue from Commercial more than double year-over-year in the most recent quarter, and that certainly contributes to the number. And yes, we've seen an overall lift in absolute demand. But we continue to also invest very heavily as we have over the last year in our monetization optimization capabilities, making sure we're getting the right ad to the right Snapchatter at the right moment. And that contributes to our ability to deliver the actions that advertisers are seeking with fewer impressions. And that has the effect of why -- of raising the output metric of eCPM. But as long as we're able to continue to drive great optimization, we don't see a corresponding lift in the cost per action to the advertiser. And I shared in my prepared remarks some metrics around, for example, what we saw with Pixel Verified Purchases. So, we're going to continue to invest there, but it's very early days in our monetization and realizing the potential monetization of the business. If you think about our content business first, very early stages there, but we're pleased with what we're seeing. And that's a big driver at the moment and optimization continues to help there. But also, we're seeing growth in engagement. And I mentioned the 50% year-over-year growth in terms of time spent with Shows, and we continue to invest there alongside the optimization. But a long way to go there to get close to market rates for our ad units and audiences. And then, of course, earlier stage at the Camera side. We're really pleased with some of the early indications we're seeing there, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, around the growth in region frequency self-serve Lens products. They nearly doubled year-over-year in the quarter. So, we've got good early traction there. And then, of course, we shared recently some of the metrics around the Map and how deep the density is there. And of course, that part of our engagement, we haven't begun to tap on monetization. So, I think, all of that sort of gives you an indication of just how early we are in realizing the full potential on monetization. And hopefully, that gives you a little more context around some of the specific dynamics on the eCPM in the period."

            "name": "Jeremi Gorman",
            "content": "Thank you, Evan. We delivered strong results this quarter and we're even more excited about the opportunities ahead of us. In Q3, we generated total revenue of $679 million, an increase of 52% year-over-year. The strength in our business reflects the deliberate and structurally sound investments we have made in our ad platform, ad products, and team. We remained nimble and responded to the difficult and rapidly changing macro conditions by supporting our advertising partners in achieving their business goals. We saw the beginnings of a recovery from brand advertisers and continued resilience from direct response advertisers, reinforcing our confidence in the long-term positioning of our business. As brands and other organizations used this period of uncertainty as an opportunity to evaluate their advertising spend, we saw many brands look to align their marketing efforts with platforms who share their corporate values. This gave us an opportunity to engage with advertisers and agencies in real time to ensure that our existing partners as well as new prospects understood our offering in relation to our values. Our sales teams were able to hold many productive C-level conversations to discuss our brand safety positioning and privacy-by-design principles, which provided an opportunity for us to prove our efficacy and ability to scale. We implemented a strategy to ensure advertisers investing in Snap found early and sustained success on our platform as they scaled with us, and we believe that the customer service our teams provided, the alignment on our brand safety principles, and the strong ROI that our advertising partners achieved all contributed to our growth this quarter. As businesses adapted and began to look for opportunities to increase their marketing budgets in Q3, we were pleased to see existing advertisers resume and even increase their budgets, as well as new advertisers allocate spend to drive real business value via our self-serve ad platform. The success we saw in our business in Q3 is the result of many long-term investments we have made to improve our sales and marketing functions, drive ROI through measurement, relevance, and optimization, and build innovative ad experiences through video and AR. It was our continued focus on these three priorities, along with our unique reach and growing global audience, which allowed us to accelerate our growth as more of the world opened up and brands returned to marketing. Across all sectors and verticals, brands are leveraging our millennial and Gen Z audience to reach new customers around the globe. In the U.S., UK, and France, we reach over 75% of 13 to 34 year olds, and we are making progress on growing our reach in other priority markets. To help advertisers better understand the Snapchat Generation, in August we launched our first-ever, global business-to-business marketing campaign, showcasing the values and behaviors that characterize our community. Through our research, we have substantiated that the Snapchat Generation is deeply purpose-driven. We found that over 80% of Snapchatters in the U.S. believe they have a personal responsibility to create positive change in the world, and they are more likely than non-Snapchatters to buy from brands which support local communities. Overall, the B2B campaign was received positively by our advertising partners and has allowed our teams to engage more productively with marketing executives at leading consumer brands as we help businesses learn how to communicate with the Snapchat Generation. We continued to add deep domain expertise under our verticalized sales model, allowing us to effectively serve advertisers of all types and sizes. This structure provided us with the flexibility to pivot resources this quarter to some of our fastest growing verticals including CPG, Streaming, Tech, Telco, Financial Services, and e-commerce. As an example, brands such as Pepsico, MGM, HiSmile, Starling Bank, and Depop as well as agency partners, Publicis and 360i, participated in our B2B marketing campaign where they provided testimonials around the positive results they achieved while partnering with our team. In addition, to support our partners through the pandemic and improve our marketing efforts, we launched Snap Focus, an online learning course for advertisers looking to create their first ad campaign on Snapchat, and Snap Connect, a new marketing program to educate global marketers about direct response advertising on Snapchat. Combined with our webinars and education sessions, our sales and marketing teams have continued to scale and serve our partners in this virtual environment. We continue to invest heavily in ranking, optimization, and measurement in order to deliver measurable ROI for our advertising partners. It was our investments in our self-serve ad platform and our ability to service our customers during a challenging time that allowed us to onboard a record number of advertisers this quarter. Ultimately, all advertisers set their budgets based on performance, be it brand affinity, purchases, or app downloads, and we continue to prove the efficacy of our ad platform by helping our advertising partners achieve their goals. E-commerce remains an exciting opportunity for us and we are doubling down on our efforts in this area. We are taking a holistic approach to e-commerce across sales, native commerce products, and ad tech, including our self-serve tools, lower-funnel optimization goals, and video ad formats. For example, last quarter we launched Dynamic Ads globally, which combine product catalogs with our optimization capabilities to reward advertisers who invest in our platform with ROI at scale, and we are already seeing strong adoption rates from Retail, CPG, Restaurant, and Gaming verticals, among others. More brands have pivoted in this direction, including Sephora investing in Dynamic Ads as a part of their long-term strategy, and Techstyle optimizing for their Fabletics Women's marketing campaign with pixel purchase optimizations. The rise of mobile content consumption, especially on mobile-native premium formats, presents us with a growing opportunity. The first building block was Discover, our video content business which we launched in 2015. We continue to invest heavily in video advertising through Commercials our nonskippable, full-screen video ad unit, and Snap Select, which enables buying of Commercials in prepackaged, fixed-price, premium inventory. First Commercial, which gives advertisers a way to reserve the first Commercial a Snapchatter sees during a Show, is now available to all advertisers in our Ads Manager following our beta launch last quarter, and we have already seen many advertisers from different verticals invest in this format. For example, we saw Entertainment brands such as NBCUniversal's Peacock invest in our First Commercial format as the world shifted to direct-to-consumer viewership and theatrical releases were put on pause. We believe augmented reality is the future of immersive customer experiences like try-on, catalog browsing, and showrooming. We invested heavily in our self-serve AR tools to provide advertisers with what they need to create, manage, and optimize an augmented reality campaign that drives measurable ROI. While this form of advertising is still nascent, we are encouraged by the early adoption we are seeing from advertisers. This quarter alone, we partnered with several leading consumer brands, such as Champs Sports, Clearly, Essie, Kohl's, Levi's, Jordan Brand, Sally Hansen, and Hoka One One, to leverage our AR and machine learning technologies to power virtual try-on experiences. While Dynamic Ads recommends items to Snapchatters based on their interests, AR try-on takes this a step further and allows Snapchatters to visualize the item in real life. For example, Clearly, an eyewear retailer, leveraged our sponsored AR Lenses to enable our community to try on different pairs of glasses, which resulted in 33 seconds of average playtime and a 5.3% share rate. Clearly was able to drive a full funnel impact for their brand, achieving a 7-point lift in brand awareness and 5-point lift in brand consideration while also driving a 46% lift in unique page viewers on their site and a 3.3% lift in purchases. Longer-term, we believe our Map represents an exciting opportunity to innovate and provide new experiences for our community and to grow revenue. We recently added Places to our Map, which helps people learn more about the businesses around them and view hours and store reviews. We also built a dedicated Local Ads objective to Ads Manager to ease the sign up flow for local businesses. Since its launch in July, we have been encouraged by the number of local businesses experimenting with the product. Though it's still early, building connections between our community and the places they visit will be instrumental in supporting local advertising in the future. Our investments in our self-serve platform, verticalized sales teams, and engaging ad experiences provide the tools necessary for advertisers to reach our valuable community. While the foundation is in place, we have a huge opportunity to scale our business as we continue to demonstrate measurable ROI for our partners, educate businesses on our unique reach, all while leading the way with innovative, digital-first ad products. In particular, e-commerce remains a focus area as we look to build upon the early momentum of our newer offerings. Longer-term, we believe Snapchatters will engage naturally with businesses of all sizes across our service, whether that be engaging with a brand's profile, finding store hours on the Map, or interacting with products using an AR Lens. Overall, this was a productive quarter for our business, and we look forward to building on our momentum as we progress toward our short-term and long-term opportunities. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Derek. Yes. Thanks for the question, Michael. And certainly, I cannot let a good sports question go without mentioning how exciting it is for our teams here in Los Angeles, this season in particular. So, we're all very excited about it over here. As Evan talked about last month, more than 40% of the U.S. Gen Z population watched premium sports content on Snap specifically, and the NBA highlights channel saw over 20% more engagement so far this season than last year. So, that helps speak to the trends. As you know, sports are absolutely highly visible to advertisers who are looking for both, premium content, contextually relevant placements and then large package buys with ourselves and with our partners that are inclusive of things like augmented reality, Bitmoji and others, as Evan mentioned. Our Commercials ad unit is continuing to perform for us. It's allowed us to increase yield with -- from premium sports content, and we're really happy with both the audience and the revenue growth on that product. Of course, it's still early for us, and we're going to continue to experiment and work with our content partners to bring immersive sports experience to Snapchatters. But in the meantime, go L.A. And I can take the part of rest of world monetization. So, just to give you an example of what we're doing here is that we are deploying a strategic hybrid strategy. So, we use resellers in a market, and we've done that for many years. We consider them to be extraordinary partners of ours and truly an extension of the Snap team. It's pretty remarkable to visit these markets and see how well they represent us. It's been a really exciting journey. But, as engagement grows, certain criteria are met with DAU, we put Snap salespeople on the ground, including account executives, account managers, creative strategists and more. And then, we work alongside our reseller partners to determine which point Snap is going to service directly and which they can -- which the resellers can best supplement. We're going to continue to deploy this hybrid strategy around the world. It's working, and we found it successful so far. We look forward to continuing to do that as we grow globally. Thanks for the question, Rich, and thank you for noticing the quality of the advertisers. You're right. Our investments in optimization, measurement and ranking are paying off, and big brands as well as our DR brands are finding success. And it's really exciting for our community who continues to see more and more relevant ads as we add to this demand across the board. Over the past five years actually we've been building a powerful video business with the goal of connecting advertisers to the Snapchat Generation. And it's really getting increasingly difficult to reach this audience on linear television. They are watching TV, it's just in their pocket. We've made several key hires in the area, and our executives most responsible for video monetization have a lot of years of experience in this field. They know their strategy and they know the buyers. Based on the strength of what we're seeing in our video business, we're continuing to invest in new products. So, to give you an example of how we're continuing to capture these budgets more and more incrementally, we recently launched First Commercials, which gives our advertisers the very first ad and the very first product that a Snapchatter sees. And every marketer knows how important it is to make that first impression. Our Commercials are designed for both social video and online video buyers. And the goal is truly to just attract incremental TV budgets into our hand-curated, brand-safe hand-curated content on Discover. So, all of those things coming together after five years of long hard work is what you're seeing right now. And we're really excited about the future. Thanks for the question, Eric. Yes, we are incredibly excited to see that our growth is returning to the levels that we saw at the beginning of the year. So, thank you for making mention of that. To give you more specifics around your question, some of our fastest growing verticals include CPG, streaming, tech, telco, financial services and e-commerce. In particular, e-commerce remains a very exciting opportunity for us. When you start to think of things like AR try-ons, the utility of being able to put shoes on your feet or sunglasses on your face or hats on your head and utilize that for utility-based advertising in AR, we are absolutely doubling down on our efforts in that area. As everybody knows, last quarter, we launched Dynamic Ads globally, and that continues to combine our product catalogs -- or the advertisers' product catalogs with optimization capabilities to reward advertisers who invest in our platform with ROI at scale. In that particular area, we're seeing strong adoption rates from retail, CPG and restaurants. And we have been working alongside travel partners, and we are ready for them when the world starts traveling again. But ultimately, we know that all of our advertisers set their budgets based on performance, whether that's brand affinity, purchases or app downloads. And we're going to continue to prove the efficacy of our platform and know that we can continue to grow and build budgets. It's important to note that it was these investments in our self-service ad platform and our ability to service our customers during this challenging time that allowed us to onboard a record number of advertisers this quarter. Sure. Thanks for the question, Brian. As I just mentioned, we are seeing a lot of success with CPG, streaming, tech, telco, financial services and e-commerce, in particular. In terms of large buckets that we had at the beginning of the year that we are no longer seeing a lot of momentum from, it's not something that we are concerned about. We obviously know that in the macro conditions, there are categories like travel and automotive that are suffering a little bit more given the macro conditions. But, relative to how they fare at Snap, it's not something that we're concerned about, because we continue to grow in these other incredible areas that are where people are finding success on the platform. I just talked about e-commerce a little bit. I will continue to put a finer point on that. I can't say enough about how important that opportunity is for us as it pertains to not only the performance that we're able to deliver for those advertisers with our great products like Dynamic Ads, but in addition, our ability to really make sure that our goal-based bidding products are serving them with the right ROI. So, we're going to continue to focus there. And when categories like travel and automotive come back, we will be welcoming them with open arms, and we're really excited to work with them. Yes. And to follow up on that, yes, we definitely believe that our verticalized sales model has helped us get through this unique time with the macro conditions, in particular, because our teams deeply understand the needs of their advertisers at this time, and there has been no more important time for that to be true. They are studying everything from tariffs to understand the impact on downstream profitability of a particular CPG company, all the way through how many people are passing through TSA every single day to know how its travel is going to be recovering. And they're doing an extraordinary job. I couldn't be more proud of the team. To make sure that the right products get to the right advertisers, we've launched a lot of B2B marketing efforts, including Snap Focus and Snap Connect, which serve different purposes, one of which is to get the first advertisements going and a second is to continue to grow it. But, as it pertains to the product specifically, you listed a few of them, but you're right. We couldn't be more lucky to be in the position to be able to talk about things like Map, shoppable AR, Dynamic Ads, first school-based bidding, globalization of our products and so on. And that team has done an incredible job of launching performance products. We know that our products work better together and they serve different purposes. Video ads, augmented reality, they both reach users, but they put them in different contexts on the app. We're continuing to see case studies where combining AR with video ad yields better results for the advertisers. And so, there's lots of opportunity to make our service and products more approachable and easier to use and more performance over time. But for us, the most critical thing is that our video ads, their performance, they're engaging. And it's really exciting to see advertisers continuing to invest more and more in our core video ad products. We're still early in the journey for augmented reality, advertising, as Evan said, but we think we can keep building on our lead here. Derek talked about the success of our self-service AR, and that is really going to lead us to connect all of the innovation happening with our Lens Studio products and our advertising technology set."

            "content": "Hi everyone, and thank you for joining our call. We added 11 million daily active users this quarter for a total of 249 million, up 4% quarter-over-quarter and 18% year-over-year, demonstrating the benefits of years of investment in our product and partnerships across a wide range of geographies. We generated $679 million in revenue this quarter, up 52% year-over-year, outperforming our expectations and highlighting the substantial value we drive to both direct response and brand advertisers during this continued period of uncertainty. Our year-over-year growth rates for both daily active users and revenue were higher this quarter than they were in Q3 of the prior year. In fact, they represent our highest Q3 growth rates since 2017. Our success underscores the excitement that our community and our advertising partners have around our innovative products and services. The adoption of augmented reality has happened faster than we had previously imagined, and we feel well positioned to execute on the many opportunities that lie ahead. Two years ago, we transformed our business by relentlessly focusing our attention on delivering return on investment for advertisers and building new products and experiences to serve our community. The revenue and community growth we have generated as a result of these efforts has afforded us the opportunity to double down and innovate even more, especially around our camera and augmented reality platform. The creative and technical teams at Snap have worked hard to support Lens Studio creators, and evolve our camera's capacity to entertain our community and help our partners grow their businesses. For example, this quarter we introduced more Lenses for try-on and commerce, with Sally Hansen creating AR trial and purchase for nail polish, and Champs doing the same for sneakers. Snapchat community engagement is strong, as we continue to grow in new markets, broaden our product offerings, and improve our underlying infrastructure. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of more than 15% year-over-year daily active user growth. We also saw strong retention in our vast community, and we continue to reach over 90% of the Gen Z population and 75% of the Gen Z and millennial population in countries like the U.S., the UK, and France. One key driver of growth across all of our markets has been product innovation and infrastructure improvements. Following the successful rebuild of our Android application last year, we are rolling out a newly streamlined messaging infrastructure that we expect will make messaging faster and more efficient, which will help drive increased engagement, especially as we expand our community across different countries and devices. These foundational investments in our core architecture have also enabled us to innovate faster and release new product features at a rapid pace. In the last year alone, we launched Brand Profiles, Minis, Places on the Map, Dynamic Ads, Bidded AR Lenses, Dynamic Lenses, Camera Kit, Snap ML Lenses, and new creative tools with lots more to come. We are currently rolling out a new five-tab navigation bar for Snapchat, which allows us to deepen the product experience for our Map and Discover platforms. We're excited to make the Snap Map more visible to new Snapchatters and invest in a better content experience for Discover, especially as we broaden our content offerings across popular creators and professional studios. Our ability to launch a large-scale fundamental product transformation like this quickly and without disruption to our business is evidence of the progress we've made. In fact, it was the first major update where we prototyped and launched on Android first due to the structural improvements we made to our Android application last year. Our investments in Lens Studio continue to drive the growth of our augmented reality platform, and we are especially excited to see Lenses created by our community driving a majority of the year-over-year growth in daily Lens views. Our Lens Studio platform allows people all over the world to create rich AR experiences that highlight the broad range of cultures represented by our community. Some of these Lenses are used by Snapchatters across the world, while others are notable for their extraordinary regional engagement. For example, a university student in India created a Lens with a \u2018smoke flare effect which went viral in India and Southeast Asia, garnering billions of views on Snapchat and even more on other social platforms. This demonstrates the impact of the creativity of our community, which empowers self-expression with augmented reality at a volume and scale we could never achieve on our own. We've also continued to invest in the technology that underlies our AR platform to empower new experiences for our community. We drew on several years of technical investment and creative experience to launch a number of extremely popular Lenses this quarter. For example, our recently launched Anime Lens uses our Snap ML technology to turn people into anime characters in real time and our community engaged with this Lens 3 billion times in its first week. As we push the envelope on what is possible in augmented reality with these new Lenses, we are even more excited to contribute these new learnings and capabilities to Lens Studio, so our community can leverage them in their own creations. Our content platform continues to mature following our investments in regionalized content and the expansion of our partnerships with both traditional media partners and newer mobile-focused content studios. Our premium Shows format continues to grow rapidly around the world, with time spent watching Shows increasing more than 50% this quarter compared to Q3 of last year. Our successful VS The World docuseries franchise launched its second season featuring Conor McGregor, and has already reached 14 million viewers. Additionally, large media companies continue to find success bringing their top linear TV shows to Snapchat to reach our differentiated audience. Over 50 million Snapchatters watch content derived from TV on Snapchat each month on average, and this familiar programming has helped drive an 80% year-over-year increase in the average number of people watching Shows every day that are over the age of 35. Additionally, as various sports leagues are resuming their seasons, our community has turned to Snap to watch the action. Last month, more than 40% of the U.S. Gen Z population watched premium sports content on Snap. The NBA highlights channel saw over 20% more engagement so far this season than last year, and SportsCenter viewership on Snapchat increased by 80% from July to September. We are also seeing dramatic growth in content engagement in markets like India, where Discover viewership grew nearly 50% quarter-over-quarter. Furthermore, in markets like France and the UK, young people turn to Discover as their destination for premium mobile content, with more than two thirds of the Gen Z and millennial population in both markets watching premium content on Discover. Finally, as our content business develops, we are also providing our partners with better monetization. This quarter, due to growth in Shows and improved monetization, we paid our partners 85% more than we did in Q3 of last year. In addition to AR and content, we are also building new ways to empower creators, developers, brands, and others to improve the entire Snapchat experience for our community. For example, we have partnered with TurboVote to launch a Snap Mini to help our Gen Z and millennial audience register for the upcoming U.S. election. Over 1 million U.S. users have signed up for the Mini, where they can get help registering to vote. According to Democracy Works, more than 50% are likely first-time voters. Additionally, we are continuing to make early progress on our gaming platform by launching three new games this quarter. Many of our early developers are deepening their investment as they explore new genres, monetization models, and game types. For example, Mojiworks, developer of the popular \u2018Ready Chef Go', is doubling down on the Snap Games opportunity and exploring new genres like music and trivia. We have also been working hard to help our developers find financial success on our platform, and have more than doubled the revenue our developers are generating this quarter compared to Q3 last year. As we look to the future, we believe that the fundamental changes we made to our products and business over the past two years have put us in a strong position to continue executing in a rapidly evolving world. Our improvements to both our core product infrastructure and our internal team and operations have enabled us to accelerate the velocity of our product innovation. Meanwhile, our deep investments in building a scalable advertising platform have allowed us to focus more of our attention on these big future opportunities. We are so excited about our progress in AR, content, and our growing platform, especially as we look to build on our momentum in these areas going forward. Thanks again for joining the call. I'll hand it over to Jeremi to talk about our business. Thanks, Ross. We're really pleased with the progress we've made on Android. We've certainly learned a lot from our prior mistakes, and the client is in a much better place and has allowed us to experiment and iterate a lot more quickly on the Android platform. We do still see some upside in the back-end improvements we're making. So, we're working a lot on improving our messaging infrastructure, for example. And that's been rolling out and really helps just improve the speed of communication, which we think can have a positive impact on engagement. So, overall, big changes to the clients on Android, more changes coming on the back-end. And then we're trying to do the same thing on iOS now. iOS was in a better place to start with. But, we really believe that we can continue to improve the iOS architecture. We've got a big initiative underway there across the entire company, which should allow us to move at a similar pace to Android because believe it or not, we can actually move faster on Android now than iOS. So, huge change. Obviously, we're really excited about it. And certainly, it's vital when we're thinking about unlocking growth in markets that are dominated by Android. Thanks for the question. Yes. At a really high level, sports are just deeply interwoven into culture, and they're really, really important to people, and therefore, they're very important to our community. So, we worked really hard to think holistically about our sports partnerships across augmented reality, of course, content. Things like Bitmoji and all of that helps people talk about and express themselves in relation to the teams that they really care about. And driving that conversation is obviously really important for the leagues and also for our business. So, we think we can continue to play a role there. It's obviously really important to our community. And Jeremi can speak to the implications that for advertisers who obviously also really want to associate themselves with sports. Yes. Thanks for the question. We're really excited about the momentum we're seeing internationally. Obviously, a lot of that is following our major investments in things like the Android rewrite, but also our partnerships with telcos and OEMs that have been helpful in driving growth there and just removing friction from using our products. One of the big things that we're really excited about also is the way that things like augmented reality have really been localized for our community because creators in these different markets are building locally relevant Lenses and then sharing them with all their friends. And so, there's this really sort of exciting and virtuous cycle that's happening here where local creators build really compelling AR experiences, share them with the broader community. People make Snaps with those and then share them with their friends or share them on other platforms, which helps support our growth overall. So, I think as we look at localized content, augmented reality and the continued growth of our partners, we're just really excited about how that's all coming together. Obviously, it's been a long road to get here, but we're excited by what we are seeing. Yes. Thanks, Justin. As we look at competition more broadly, obviously, entertainment services do compete with the content section of our business. But obviously, the core driver of engagement on Snapchat is communication, and that has been impacted by COVID. In the areas that are more open, like in Europe and whatnot, we see less of an impact. We think some of that is due to the fact that maybe people are making fewer friendships or things like that when they're stuck in their houses. And that's one we're paying attention to. But overall, our audience in the U.S. and in North America is growing. We are seeing some slight shifts in engagement. But, we think that as the U.S. continues to open up following COVID that we'll return to more normal engagement patterns there. Looking at the 5-tab navigation bar, we've learned a lot from some of our prior redesigns. And so, as we look at realizing this big opportunity of breaking out things like the Map and Discover, giving them more prominence in the service, our number one goal is really to do no harm to core engagement. And so, that's really what we focused on here. What we're excited about over the longer term obviously is that now we have two new areas to really play and experiment rapidly, and surfacing those areas to our entire community allows us to do that a lot faster. Previously, both Discover and the Map were relatively hidden inside of Snapchat. So, we're excited about the long-term opportunity. The same way that separating social for media really made a big difference for our business. It took a little while to pay off obviously, but we've really seen the long-term impact. So, this is another one of those changes that's designed to unlock longer-term opportunity. Of course, number one priority is do no harm. But now, we're really excited to iterate here and to continue to grow those platforms that are so important to us. Thanks for the question on games, something we're definitely very excited about. I think, the best way to think about it is, there's a lot of little experiments that we're running right now. Games are still hidden in chat and so you got to really look for them to play. And so, that allows us to really focus on iterating and building engagement, learning what sort of content works, learning what types of services our developers really need in order to grow games and monetize them and reengage their communities. So, there's definitely a lot of work to do there. One of the experiments that we're trying right now that's pretty fun is around Snap Token. So, that helps our community engage with in-app purchases inside of games, which provides another revenue stream to gaming companies and our partners. And so, really what we're doing is just listening to our community, listening to our partners and working hard to build the platform. And this is the approach we've taken with some of the other platforms we've built like content or AR, where we start with a select set of partners and just do our best to listen and learn and iterate until it really clicks. So, lots of exciting things. Some games obviously are doing better than others, and we're learning from the ones that are working and the ones that aren't working, and helping our partners pivot and continue to grow engagement around gaming. Well, as you mentioned, the stars are really aligning on our augmented reality business at the moment, which is super exciting. So, the last five years, we've obviously worked very-hard to evolve the technology, and we've gotten to a place where we're capable of some pretty sophisticated rendering, things like Snap ML, for example, like really represent a step change in augmented reality because you go from sort of overlaying 3D graphics on a scene to fundamentally re-rendering reality. And that's unlocked a lot of really compelling new use cases. Of course, our community, they're engagement with augmented reality has just exploded over the past few years. So, it's become really an everyday behavior for Snapchatters, and that's something that's really important. But, I think the big change really that's accelerated with COVID, has been that businesses are coming to the table and really understanding how AR can drive their business. And frankly, I think businesses were just less open to these types of experiments when retail was open and widely accessible and things like that. And so, we've just seen a lot of like openness and excitement from brands to try new things and help customers trial their products. Trial is a hugely important part of driving sales in retail. And so, being able to power these trial and experiences, whether that's shoes or nail polish or beauty products or whatever, and then convert directly to purchase, I think, achieves two goals for businesses. One, of course, it helps them build their brand and things like that, but also it really drives ROI. And so, I think businesses are open-minded to trying ROI and they are open-minded to trying AR, and they're finding ROI when they do that. And so, that's really exciting for us. As we look at the next couple of years, there's still just a massive, massive road map in terms of the overall platform improvements we're trying to make. That should enable even more deeply engaging AR experiences. So, we'll be really focused on just building the platform, helping people learn how AR can help them achieve their business goals. But overall, we're just excited because this change happened faster than we expected. And it's just exciting to see so many brands playing around with this totally new category."

After the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded. Thank you very much. Mr. David Ometer of Investor Relations, you may begin.\nDavid Ometer: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Snap's second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With us today are Evan Spiegel, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder; Jeremi Gorman, Chief Business Officer; and Derek Andersen, Chief Financial Officer. Earlier today, we made a slide presentation available that provides an overview of our user and financial metrics for the second quarter 2020, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.snap.com. Now I will cover the safe harbor. Today's call is to provide you with information regarding our second quarter 2020 performance in addition to our financial outlook. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. Any statement that refers to expectations, projections, guidance or other characterizations of future events, including financial projections, future market conditions or the impact of COVID-19 on our business and on the economy as a whole is a forward-looking statement based on assumptions today.

Please refer to our filings with the SEC to understand how we calculate our metrics. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Evan.\nEvan Spiegel: Thanks everyone for joining our call. This has been an extremely challenging time, and our team has done an outstanding job continuing to support the growth of our community, which increased 17% year-over-year to 238 million daily active users, as well as building our business, with revenue growing 17% year-over-year to $454 million. While our revenue growth rate continues to be impacted by ongoing market disruptions, the fundamentals of our business are strong, and the high levels of engagement on our service are backed by years of investment in our self-serve advertising platform, which is helping our partners achieve success and grow their businesses in this uncertain environment. I am most proud of our team for the work they did to create our Snap Partner Summit this quarter, which was delivered virtually in an augmented world. We announced several new products like Minis, Voice Scan, Camera Kit, Places on the Snap Map, Bitmoji for third party games, as well as several new partnerships and a fresh slate of content. We also made Snapchat easier to navigate with our new Action Bar which provides top-level navigation to more easily access the Snap Map, Chat, Camera, and Discover, resulting in more surface area and accessibility for each of these platforms. We are working hard to overlay new computing experiences on the world through augmented reality. And the Snap Partner Summit showcased some of our latest AR products, including Local Lenses that allow people to share augmented reality experiences together overlaid on their neighborhood cityscape, and SnapML, which empowers members of our community to bring their machine learning models directly into Lenses on Snapchat. This enabled Gucci to leverage Wannaby\u2019s foot-tracking technology to help people try on their latest sneakers in Snapchat, and even buy them directly within the Lens. These sorts of augmented reality experiences are especially powerful in the post-COVID retail environment, where brands are investing more in virtual try-on. In addition to our new augmented reality products, we also released Minis to enable developers to build interactive and social experiences for our community. For example, when movie theaters reopen, friends will be able to browse and purchase tickets together in the upcoming Atom Tickets Mini. We\u2019re excited to help our partners understand how they will benefit from our long-term vision for Snap, and the many ways that they can use our products and platform to connect with our community and build their businesses. Our community grew by 17% year-over-year, with 238 million people using Snapchat every day on average in the quarter. This continues our recent momentum in daily active user growth, with the last three quarters seeing our highest year-over-year growth rates since 2017. We now reach more than 100 million people in the U.S. alone, and are also seeing strong growth in our core markets in North America, Europe, and Australia. We are also continuing to invest in app performance and localization to make our service more accessible to people all over the world, with Snapchat now available to over two billion people in their native language. These efforts have helped us grow even faster in emerging markets like India, where we\u2019ve seen over 100% growth in daily active users over the past year. As the changing public health landscape accelerates the adoption of digital products, we believe there is a large opportunity for us to further empower new behaviors with AR, entertainment, and commerce. For example, we continue to see increasing engagement with our camera, and the number of Snaps created every day grew at double the pace of our daily active user growth over the past year, making Snapchat one of the world\u2019s most-used cameras. We\u2019re especially excited to see that the adoption of our AR platform is also accelerating, with the number of people playing with Lenses every day growing by 37% year-over-year. This growth has been driven in part by the community of talented Lens creators and partners that are creating and distributing Lenses on Snapchat. Creators are quickly adopting new Lens Studio capabilities to create Lenses that put a lightsaber in your hand, turn the entire world into spaghetti, and let you try on clothes and makeup. Today Snapchatters play with Lenses created by our community six times as often as they did just last year, and these Lenses now drive more than a quarter of all Lens engagement on Snapchat. We are excited to see that our product innovation in AR is empowering the creativity of our Lens creator community, which in turn has driven growth in user engagement. With so much happening around the world today, our Discover platform is more important than ever in helping our community stay educated and informed about current events. Snapchat has become a go-to destination for credible and accurate news content during the pandemic, with more than half of the entire U.S. Gen Z population watching COVID-related news created by our partners. Additionally, following the murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor, we published curated Community Stories featuring powerful Snaps from our community, which ranged from breaking news about peaceful protests to a dialog about what it means to be Living While Black in America. We are also rolling out Happening Now, a dedicated section of Discover that provides breaking news from media partners such as NBC News and ESPN summarized in a single Snap. In addition to news, Discover has also provided a premium mobile entertainment experience for our community as they are sheltering in their homes. For example, Will From Home, which culminated in a Fresh Prince of Bel-Air cast reunion, was watched by more than 35 million people. Snap Originals continue to attract audiences that rival those of top TV series, and have reached more than 75% of the U.S. Gen Z population so far this year. In addition, many of our media partners are finding success adapting their television properties for our platform in order to reach an incremental audience that is not watching TV. According to eMarketer, the average U.S. adult spends 29 more minutes with mobile content compared to TV, which is up from six fewer minutes on mobile in 2018. We believe this trend is driven primarily by the younger generation, whose time spent watching TV is a fraction of their older counterparts'. This creates an opportunity for our media partners, several of whom spend significant resources to create high-quality content for TV, to expand their total audience to include these younger viewers. Several shows that are finding success on Discover were originally shot for linear TV, and these shows have reached an audience of over 100 million people on Snapchat so far this year. We added more than 180 new Discover channels this quarter, and recently announced newly-expanded partnerships with Disney, ESPN, NBC, ViacomCBS, the NBA, and the NFL as we continue to expand our curated content business. The strong engagement with our platform and products is driving results in our advertising business, despite the many macro headwinds currently experienced by our partners. Our advertising business grew 17% year-over-year to $454 million in revenue. We are pleased to see the continuing growth in our revenue especially in the face of extreme dislocations in the market. As heavily-impacted companies like travel and in-theater entertainment pull back spend, we have transitioned to helping them plan for a future recovery led in part by our audience. We have also seen that certain industries like CPG, gaming, streaming services, and e-commerce have benefited from some of the COVID-related changes in consumer behavior, and have been leaning in as advertisers on our platform. Our significant investments over the past few years in our team and our ad platform helped us provide substantial value to both direct response and brand advertisers as they navigate these rapid and unprecedented shifts in the market. Our direct response business continues to drive meaningful return on investment at scale, especially during the current environment, where performance-oriented apps and e-commerce advertisers look to reach customers who are increasingly engaging and transacting on the Internet rather than in-person. This has been accelerated by the major improvements we continue to make to our ad products and backend optimization, which have helped us increase the scale at which we're able to deliver results for direct response advertisers. For example, we are rolling out dynamic ads globally, so that retailers like Sephora and Adidas can run ecommerce campaigns on Snapchat that automatically optimize across their entire catalog. These product improvements also drive a virtuous cycle for our direct response business. As we onboard more advertisers, the increased quality and diversity of our advertising demand means that we have more relevant ads to choose from when deciding which ad to show a particular person at a particular time. This in turn drives more value for advertisers with fewer wasted impressions, while simultaneously reducing the perceived ad load for our community. While these uncertain times have impacted many businesses in different ways, one consistent theme across all brands has been the focus on reaching customers in thoughtful and genuine ways. Brands have collaborated on many of the new products we are building, including by investing heavily in our new AR capabilities to engage an audience that is not able to visit their stores or see their products in person. We recently launched Brand Profiles, an important first step towards building a native home for all of the organic experiences that brands are building. Snapchatters can now visit the profiles of brands like Dior, Target, and Tim Hortons to watch their Stories, play with their AR experiences, and even buy their products through our native commerce integrations. We are excited to evolve our relationships with brands of all sizes as we continue to build tools for brands to organically engage with our audience. Finally, the growing focus on brand safety and privacy across the entire industry places us in a unique position of strength as we have invested in these areas from the beginning of our business. The very foundation of both our consumer product and our advertising business has been built around our commitment to protecting the privacy of our community, and to delivering a safe environment for brands. We believe that building trust with our community and providing a safe environment on Snapchat is critical to our long-term success and helps us live up to the high expectations of both our community and our advertising partners. This reflects our broader commitment to making a positive impact with our company and our products. Our strategy is simple. We try to do the right thing, even when it\u2019s hard, and we work to acknowledge and fix our mistakes quickly. Looking forward, we expect that the current operating environment will become more complex, this year alone, we have seen sweeping changes to our global economy, the privacy and regulatory landscape, public health and social behaviors, and the direct confrontation of a legacy of injustice and extreme inequality in America. This means that our strategy of trying to do the right thing isn\u2019t just a moral imperative. We believe that it is the only way to achieve the long-term vision for our business. We have a lot to learn as we grow our global audience and expand our advertising and content partnerships, and it gives me great hope to see our team, community, and partners actively engaged in building a better future. Thank you again for joining us today. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jeremi to share more about our business.\nJeremi Gorman: Thank you, Evan. We\u2019re pleased with our results for this quarter amidst a challenging and evolving global environment and we continue to see significant upside and opportunity for our business as we support our community and advertising partners. In Q2, we generated total revenue of $454 million, an increase of 17% year-over-year. We are confident that our business is well-positioned for the long-term, evidenced by the resilience we are seeing with direct response advertisers, as well as our continued success helping brands craft valuable messages and effectively reach our community. We\u2019ve had a lot of conversations within Snap about how our team, our products, and our business can be forces for positive change in the world. In the U.S., our platform reaches 90% of 13 to 24 year olds and 75% of 13 to 34 year olds. This audience is critical for advertisers as the Snapchat Generation develops lifelong habits, but also because young people are focused on driving change in the world and building a better future. We take our responsibility to educate, inform, and support this incredible generation very seriously and we\u2019ve committed to using our business as a force for good. Given the relationship we have built with the Snapchat community worldwide, we\u2019ve been able to help brands deliver timely messages that resonate with 13 to 34 year olds, who see the world differently than their parent\u2019s generation. This is particularly important against the backdrop of current events, as advertisers look to appropriately align their messages with what our community seeks; positivity, good will, and most-importantly, authenticity. We have partnered with many brands in verticals that are well-positioned in the current environment, such as consumer packaged goods, gaming, streaming, and e-commerce, while also helping our partners with recovery roadmaps for industries that have experienced an outsized impact from COVID-19. We had the opportunity to work closely with Monster Energy to adapt a new campaign for Snapchat in response to stay-at-home orders with their #CrushQuarantine campaign across Snap Ads, Commercials, Story Ads and Lenses. Monster\u2019s multi-ad product exposure ultimately generated a 12 point lift in ad awareness and a 5 point lift in message association. Our large audience, creative formats and advanced measurement tools provided a significant opportunity for brands such as Monster Energy to reach Snapchatters during the global pandemic. Our team has also been working hard to provide useful products and resources for businesses as they manage the current economic landscape. We added multi-country targeting capabilities, allowing advertisers to optimize for the best performing customers, regardless of location, catering to location agnostic products and services, like commerce, fintech, and games. In addition, we launched Places on our Snap Map, which highlights businesses that are popular with our community and offers information like hours, reviews, and delivery options via third party partners. While we are just getting started with this opportunity, as parts of the world begin to reopen safely, we will be there to help the Snapchat Generation support their favorite local businesses and discover new ones. We remain focused on making progress against our ARPU opportunity through our three key priorities. First, investing in our ad platform in order to drive improved relevance and deliver measurable ROI. Second, efficiently scaling our sales and marketing functions to support our advertising partners globally. And third, building innovative ad experiences through video and augmented reality that deliver real business value. Our three priorities along with our unique reach and growing, global audience allow us to drive performance at scale. Since completing the transition to our self-serve ad platform, we have been able to reliably translate improvements in relevance, optimization, and measurement into revenue growth by delivering increased ROI. During a time of disruption, marketers must make difficult decisions. They need flexibility, creativity and strong relationships, but most importantly, they need performant media. Advertisers are becoming more performance-oriented, and the economic conditions only accelerated that trend this quarter. Our flexible and advanced self-serve platform, our strong suite of performance ad products, and our relentless focus on measurement and ROI, continue to help our advertising partners deliver positive results. The global health crisis has also accelerated the shift to a more digital economy. Our advertising partners are exploring more ways to offer services digitally, including at-home fitness apps, online education programs, retail stores and restaurants offering online ordering and delivery services, and mobile-first banking and trading. This crisis is encouraging all business owners to adopt digital marketing methods to engage with their customers globally, and we are well-positioned to take advantage of this shift. Our early investments in building the fundamentals of our global business have paid off, and have resulted in our highest number of active advertisers to date this quarter. We\u2019ve built a full suite of ad products designed to meet advertisers\u2019 needs in this new world, particularly for ecommerce, such as swipe-to-call, pixel-verified purchase, app re-engagement, and Dynamic Ads. We recently launched Dynamic Ads globally, and we are finding that advertisers are already seeing early success with this new ad format. Rob Seidu, Senior Director of Media Activation at Adidas, said \"In the wake of the COVID-19 epidemic, Adidas has further accelerated its digital business. With ecommerce a key focus for us in 2020 and beyond, we were excited to Beta test Snapchat\u2019s Dynamic Ads in the UK, Germany, France and the Netherlands. Within weeks we saw 52% growth in return on advertising spend and we have subsequently grown our investment.\" More and more e-commerce businesses are adopting our Snap pixel to optimize for down-funnel purchase objectives, demonstrating the increased demand we are seeing from businesses measuring campaigns via first party attribution. For example, in Q2 2020 Chipotle launched a new free delivery campaign on Snapchat to drive purchases both on Chipotle.com and within their app. Their campaign drove over 3x the number of attributed purchases compared to their Q1 2020 campaign and 171% increase in return on ad spend compared to the prior quarter. We remain focused on helping businesses such as Chipotle translate measurement and optimization into meaningful conversions and strong ROI. Our second priority is to grow demand through better service of our advertising partners. We continue to hire talented sales professionals to build out and improve our verticalized coverage that serves many advertisers across the globe. While we are not able to host in-person meetings with our advertising partners, our teams have quickly pivoted efforts to virtual industry education, and our team has led thought-leadership webinars during quarantine and partnered with many industry leaders like Shopify and Smartly.io to further educate advertisers about our robust ad tools and capabilities. We are also supporting advertisers by building out more on-demand learning tools such as Snap Focus, which includes six learning courses that walks through everything advertisers need to know to create their first ad campaign. Our third priority is to lead the way with innovative advertising. Over the past five years, we\u2019ve been building a powerful video business with the goal of connecting brands and advertisers to the Snapchat Generation. For example, COVERGIRL Clean Fresh came to Snapchat to get in front of the hard-to- reach Gen Z and Millennial female audience. Their campaign leaned heavily into Premium Video, featuring Snap Select Commercials, Snap Ads and Filters. Of the total audience reach, 62% was unique to Snap. The campaign drove a 9 point lift in Ad Awareness, and a lift in Purchase Intent that was 4.5x the Snap US CPG Norm. This is just one example of many that signals a broader shift in how Gen Z and Millennials consume content. It is getting harder and harder to reach this audience on linear TV or commercial-supported streaming, and it is not just the younger generations, average daily Discover content viewership by people over 35% has increased by over 40% year-over-year. Based on this growth and in response to the evolving needs of our advertising partners, we introduced First Commercial, giving advertisers a way to reserve the first Commercial a Snapchatter sees during the first Show they watch, allowing brands to make that all-important first impression. Our Commercials are designed for both Social Video and Online Video buyers, with the goal of attracting incremental Online Video and TV budgets into our hand-curated, brand-safe content environment. In fact, the content on our Discover platform is brand-safe by design. In order to provide advertisers with fixed priced, reserved inventory next to this content, we introduced Snap Select, where ads only appear in our hand-curated selection of Shows and content from media brands like ESPN, NBC, and People. In Q2 we expanded our Snap Select curated ad placement options to five topics, 'Sports', 'Entertainment', 'Beauty', 'Lifestyle', and 'News', enabling advertisers to reach viewers within each vertical. We believe that the future of customer interactions is immersive. The most engaging and creative ads on our platform are powered by our augmented reality Lenses. Brands from every vertical have worked with us to provide Snapchatters with fun ads that they play with and share with friends. Ultimately we want to enable advertisers with the tools to build the digital layer around their products. For example, we recently launched our augmented reality Lens \u2018try-on\u2019 campaign with luxury brand Gucci, which allows Snapchatters to virtually try on and purchase some of Gucci\u2019s most iconic shoes via Snapchat. The Lens was played with by our community for 22 seconds on average and in some markets generated a five times Return on Ad Spend. Snapchatters are actively looking for more and more ways to engage with brands on our platform, and we\u2019re excited to help partners like Gucci connect with them  during this time. We believe that AR try-on is going to be incredibly important to the future of commerce and we are excited to work with more partners to build out incredible experiences for our community. Longer-term, we see a significant opportunity for brands to provide utility for Snapchatters while generating real business value across our service \u2013 not just via ads in content. Brands are starting to invest in Snapchat beyond advertising by building fun, engaging, and useful experiences for Snapchatters. The launch of Brand Profiles this month, which Evan highlighted earlier, is a key pillar of this future. Today, our focus is on giving Brands a home for all the innovative AR experiences that they create, alongside their stories. In the future, we believe that Snapchatters will engage naturally with businesses of all sizes across our service. For a brand like Target, this could mean they visit the Target Store on the Map to check store hours; use a Mini to find the best offers with friends; try on the latest looks via an AR Lens; and more. In the five years since we launched ads on Snapchat, we\u2019ve created the industry\u2019s first-ever vertical video format, brought branded AR experiences to the mainstream, and pioneered privacy-safe, mobile- first advertising in order to help advertisers everywhere reach our community. We will continue to invest for the long-term by demonstrating measurable ROI for our advertising partners, empowering our teams to speak strategically to the value of our ads, and leading the way with innovative advertising products and services to help advertisers scale. We\u2019ve built a robust advertising platform to reach the Snapchat Generation, who are digitally native and uniquely positioned to help jumpstart the recovery. Given our young and influential community, their depth of engagement on our platform, and our overall opportunity to take share of the growing digital advertising market, we believe we are well- positioned to drive business results for advertisers over the long-term. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Derek.\nDerek Andersen: Thanks Jeremi. Our Q2 financial results reflect our priorities of growing our community, making focused investments in the future of our business, and scaling our operations efficiently in order to drive towards profitability and positive free cash flow. As Evan mentioned earlier, our community grew to 238 million daily active users in Q2, reflecting year-over-year growth of 17% or 35 million. Growth in our community was robust, however, the final result fell below our earlier estimate of 239 million. At the onset of widespread shelter-in-place orders, as people sought to stay connected and entertained from home, we observed an increase in daily active users that informed our initial estimate. This initial lift dissipated faster than we anticipated as shelter-in-place conditions persisted. Despite the unusual circumstances influencing user growth in the quarter, we were pleased with the overall level of growth and that growth continued month-over-month from April to May and May to June. The growth in our community continued to be broad based in Q2. In North America, DAU grew by 9% year-over-year to reach 90 million. In Europe, DAU grew by 12% to reach 71 million. In Rest of World, DAU grew by 37% to reach 77 million. The outsized growth in Rest of World follows the rebuild of our Android application in 2019, and our subsequent efforts to further localize the product. A good example of this momentum can be seen in India, where daily active users more than doubled year-over-year in Q2. We see a significant opportunity to continue to grow our community as we further invest in localization of our product through language support, local content, and marketing partnerships across a variety of geographies. Q2 revenue was $454 million, an increase of 17% year-over-year. While our growth rate for the full quarter exceeded the early quarter-to-date result we shared in our prior call, the path to this outcome was not a straight line. The operating environment has remained challenging as COVID-19 continues to impact macroeconomic conditions, and the businesses of our advertising clients. Many of our advertisers have seen interruptions in their businesses, especially those that rely on in-person interaction with their customers such as restaurants, entertainment venues, transportation services, physical retailers, and hospitality providers among others. In addition, many advertisers paused spending for periods of time during the quarter in order to swap out their ad creative for messaging that was more appropriate for the given moment. These challenging circumstances interrupted otherwise robust momentum in our self-serve platform. We continue to see strong adoption of our goal based bidding products, driven by demand for down funnel bidding objectives, including pixel-verified purchases, pixel-verified subscriptions, app purchases, and other objectives that are tied to directly measurable returns on ad spending. For example, revenue from pixel-verified purchases increased more than 4x year-over-year in Q2, and is now among our most important goal based bidding products. From a regional perspective, our North America revenue grew 18% year-over-year in Q2, or roughly in line with the business overall. In Europe, revenue grew 30% year-over-year as the end of stay at home orders in Europe has contributed to an improving operating environment in this region. In addition, Europe was relatively less impacted by advertisers pausing spend to swap out creative messaging in Q2. In Rest of World, revenue grew 2% year-over-year in Q2 with the relatively lower growth rate reflecting COVID-19 related operating headwinds that were more pronounced for our advertising partners in this region, including limitations on cash transactions in some countries where cash transactions remain important to direct response advertisers, and supply chain issues that impacted certain ecommerce categories more significantly in this region, among other factors. ARPU was stable in Q2 as year-over-year growth in daily active users was approximately equal to year-over-year growth in revenue. Higher sell-through of impressions, and strong growth in content engagement, have contributed to nearly doubling year-over-year in Q2. As a result, eCPM declined 24% year-over-year in Q2, which is roughly in line with the decline observed in the prior quarter. While we aspire to achieve a market level eCPM for our audiences and ad units over time, relatively lower eCPM\u2019s in the near term position us well to attract and retain new advertisers by helping to deliver an attractive return on ad spend. Gross margins were 47% in Q2, up one percentage point versus the prior year. Infrastructure costs per DAU were $0.69 in Q2, which is the lowest cost per DAU we have reported since Q1 of 2017, and comes on the heels of our annual infrastructure cost camp where our engineers dedicate time to infrastructure efficiency projects that go above and beyond our ongoing cost management programs. On the content side, we have been doubling down on our investments in premium content, and we are seeing productive returns on these investments with the daily average number of Snapchatters watching Shows growing more than 45% year-over-year in Q2. In addition, we continue to see our overall Discover audience mature, with the daily average number of Snapchatters in the 35 and over age group engaging with Discover content growing at a rate of more than 40% in Q2. We are particularly pleased that we have been able to grow our community at a robust rate, and make investments in premium content, while continuing to expand our gross margins. Operating expenses were $307 million in Q2, up 19% year-over-year. This increase reflects continued investment in our talent base, driven primarily by growth in our engineering and monetization teams. We\u2019ve observed a steady and significant improvement in employee retention over the past year, and this has helped ensure that the investments in our talent base are highly productive, which is evidenced by the product innovation showcased during our recent partner summit. We have also made investments in marketing to grow our advertiser base and Snapchatter community, which have contributed in part to robust growth in these areas. These investments have been partially offset by savings related to lower travel and event related spending while our teams largely continue to work from home. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $96 million in Q2, or $17 million unfavorable versus the prior year. While we have carefully prioritized our investments given the uncertain operating environment, we have remained focused on investing in the long-term growth of our business in order to build on the momentum we have established with our community, and our advertising partners. While this has put downward pressure on adjusted EBITDA in the near term, we believe it is the right decision for the long-term health of our business given the strength of our balance sheet. Operating income in Q2 was negative $311 million, or $6 million unfavorable versus the prior year, as lower stock-based compensation partially offset the year-over-year decline in adjusted EBITDA. While we have continued to grow our team, we have seen stock-based compensation decline year-over-year by approximately 5% in total. This decline comes as our team continues to migrate towards sustainable and competitive compensation structures that we have put in place in the years following our IPO. We view careful management of our stock based compensation programs as a key input to efficiently managing our fully diluted shares outstanding as we seek to build shareholder value over the long-term. Net income in Q2 was negative $326 million, or $71 million unfavorable versus the prior year, which reflects the flow through from operating income noted above, higher interest expense related to the convertible notes issued over the course of the past year, and the impact of one-time gains in the prior year related to the disposal of certain assets. Free cash flow was negative $82 million in Q2, an improvement of $21 million year-over-year, as lower adjusted EBITDA, higher interest payments and higher capital spending were more than offset by improvements in net working capital as we continue to scale our business efficiently. We ended Q2 with $2.8 billion in cash and marketable securities, up from $2.1 billion at the end of Q1, which reflects the proceeds of the convertible notes issued in Q2. When combined with our undrawn credit facility, we currently have access to approximately $4 billion in total capital, which ensures we have the working capital necessary to stay focused on the long-term regardless of the operating environment. Similar to last quarter, we do not intend to provide financial guidance for Q3, but we do want to provide a sense for where we are today and how we plan to invest in our business. Thus far in Q3 we estimate year-over-year revenue growth to be 32% through July 19. While we are cautiously optimistic that these trends could sustain over time, we are also conscious that operating conditions may remain volatile, and that economic conditions could further deteriorate. For example, advertising demand in Q3 has historically been bolstered by factors that appear unlikely to materialize in the same way they have in prior years, including the back to school season, film release schedules, and the operations of various sports leagues. At this point in time it is difficult to predict how these factors may impact advertising demand in the remainder of Q3. Our best estimate at this point is that our full quarter revenue growth rate is likely to be below our quarter-to-date estimated actual growth rate, and as a result we have built our internal investment plan based on revenue growth of approximately 20%. We intend to continue to invest in our business in Q3 and our estimates for our cost structure assume that daily active users will be between 242 million and 244 million in Q3. This implies year-over-year growth of approximately 15% to 16% or 32 million to 34 million daily active users. On the expense side, we currently expect that our combined cost of revenue and operating costs, which are included in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, will grow year-over-year in Q3 at percentage rates in the low to mid-20s, as we continue to invest in the long-term growth of our business. Given that a small minority of our cost structure varies directly with revenue in the short-term, we do not currently expect substantial variance in the cost growth estimate regardless of the revenue outcome in Q3. While there is continued uncertainty about near-term revenue growth rates given the challenging operating environment, we are pleased with the strength of the underlying momentum in our Snapchatter and advertiser communities, and we remain highly optimistic about the long-term prospects for our business. Thank you for joining our call today and we will now take your questions.\nOperator: That concludes the prepared remarks for today\u2019s earnings call. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRoss Sandler: Hey guys. Just I think what everybody on the call wants to know is, are things improving or not really? So can you talk about what might have caused the growth rates to pick up from mid-teens in 2Q to the low 30s in July? And then maybe beyond the reasons provided a minute ago, why you expect that to drop off in the future? Or is that just some conservatism baked in to the plan? And then any color just over the last couple of months, since the last update on growth rates for brand advertising revenue versus direct response, advertising revenue, any color there would be helpful. Thanks a lot.\nEvan Spiegel: Sure. Thanks for the question Ross. I'll give a little bit more color here is that we're really proud of the work that our team did to deliver results for our business. We're working from home and they're challenging operating environment this past quarter and continue to do today. We mentioned this on our prior call that we experienced a growth rate of 15% through the first few weeks of Q2, so our final results of 17% was just above this, but the result wasn't in a straight line. There were periods of time where advertisers had to pause, to reshift, to create of these kinds of things, so it was not straight line. They faced the challenges in their business due to COVID-19 and other interruption. And we also saw a number of advertisers pause spending as time just get adjusted, better suit the moment, but to be specific our direct response business improvement just was resilient and we have continued to benefit from the growth in adoption of our goal-based bidding product and that is driving the continued growth in the top line overall that you are seeing now. As far as some of the other parts, the brand side of the business has begun to recover as revenue growth in the rest of world has recovered. And this is contributing in part to the improved results we've seen this quarter. In addition, we see continued strength in categories like CPG, streaming, home fitness and tech and of course we're continuing to see declines in things like tourism, dining restaurants, while they continue to be challenged in this environment. We're hopeful that the trends that we've observed recently will persist, but we're also conscious that the operating environment does remain challenging. And many of the factors that have historically contributed to the growth of Q3 are unlikely to materialize in the same way this year that they have in prior years. Examples of that would be the start of the NFL season, tent-pole movies being moved out of summer movie season to school, et cetera, all of these things will happen, but just in ways that were a little bit less familiar. So that gives some color hopefully on the cautiousness there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rich Greenfield of LightShed Partners. Please go ahead.\nRich Greenfield: Hi, a couple of questions. I mean, I guess first off, Evan, you've talked a lot about the investments you've made in content, obviously Discover looks dramatically different. You are putting a lot of effort into Minis and other things basically a lot of spend to make the product better. Curious then why are we seeing sort of a deceleration in user growth? It seems like Snap is so much better than it was six and 12 months ago. And I maybe even specifically calling out Europe, like why is European growth kind of post the Android, why are we not continuing to see a continued acceleration as content flows in over there as well? And then just on kind of the elephant in the room, there has been a boycott as I'm sure you and everyone are aware of some of your peers, but most notably Facebook. When you think about the commentary that Jeremi and Derek were just talking about for Q3 and even Q4, what is factored in for shift of spends from other platforms? How are you taking advantage of major advertisers literally stopping their spend on Facebook and even some of the other platforms?\nDerek Andersen: Hey, Rich, it's Derek speaking. I'll take the first part of your question there around the growth. I think the first thing that I'd share is we've been pleased with the growth trajectory of our community over the past year. The 35 million DAU that we added in Q2 was among our highest quarters of absolute year-over-year growth that we've seen since 2017. Following the rebuild of our Android application in early 2019 and our subsequent efforts to localize our product, we've seen elevated growth rates in the Rest of World region. And I noted specifically some of the gains we've made in India in my prepared remarks. We've also seen fairly healthy growth rates in our more established markets in regions of North America and Europe. Our estimates for DAU in Q3 are for 15% to 16% year-over-year growth, which as you noted is 1% to 2% below the year-over-year growth rate we observed in Q2. And I can share some further context on that. First, I would note that Q3 of the prior year reflects the full quarter benefit of AR products we launched in the middle of Q2 of 2019. So this contributes to a tougher year-over-year comp this coming quarter. In addition, the sequential growth in Q3 is typically seasonally lower than Q2 and our estimates for the sequential growth in Q3 take this into account. So after taking these factors into consideration, we believe our estimates for Q3 reflect the continuation of the healthy underlying growth trends that we've observed in the business over the past year. So we continue to see a lot of opportunities to grow our community over the long-term. And we are focused on investing in our product to realize this opportunity as a result. This is why we've shared our plans to continue to invest in our talent base, our premium content and marketing in addition to our efforts to further localize our product over time. So thanks again for the question. I hope you find this additional context helpful. I'll turn it over to Jeremi to handle the second part there.\nJeremi Gorman: Great, thank you, Rich for the question. I want to speak specifically about the Facebook boycott to your question. It is difficult to ascertain exactly what the impact of the Facebook boycott is on revenue at this time. Some of the Facebook boycott could also be related to overall content marketing budgets, just given the environment. What we do know is that it's always positive to engage at the highest levels of an organization. And this conversation has opened the door for us to do that extremely frequently at the CEO and CMO level. And in particular, we've been designed in a brand-safe, hand-curated way since the beginning. There is no town hall or ability for an unvetted user to post to our whole community. And as advertisers evaluate platforms, which align with their values, these deliberate decisions made years ago are of paramount importance. With that being said, the majority of our revenue is VR, which is a segment not broadly participating in the boycott. And with the advent of dynamic ads, the addition of worldwide targeting and more, we're continuing to deliver results for those advertisers, which put us in a strong position to gain and retain those advertisers over time, independent of the boycott.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Heath, your line is open on this end.\nHeath Terry: Great. Thank you. When we think about things from just maybe a little bit of a higher level perspective, I was wondering if you could give us a sense of sort of the evolution of the advertising base over the course of the crisis. Just in terms of the vertical, the goals that you're seeing then and seek out and sort of the tech in sales channel that they're using to engage with you. And particularly to the extent that you're seeing advertisers new to the platform, any sense where their spend is coming from? And I guess at the same level, that question about your users, how are the users that are new to the platform sort of different in their behavior? Maybe quantify it in terms of time spent on the platform and the way that's evolving.\nJeremi Gorman: Sure. Thanks for the question, Heath. Our early investments to build the fundamentals of our global business have really paid off and they've resulted in our highest number of active advertisers in quarter-to-date this quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we do continue to see strength in categories like CPG streaming at home fitness and tech, and we talked about tourism and dining restaurants earlier, which do continue to be challenged. The sales team does continue to support advertisers of all space currently, whether they are economically challenged or not, so that we can focus on the long-term of the business, but have pivoted our resources towards the advertisers that are continuing to spend in the direct response space. We are continuing to see that strong demand from direct response advertisers, looking for lower funnel data optimization and delivering ROI. I think generally the way to look at it is that the global health crisis has accelerated the shift to a more digital economy. So anything in that category is \u2013 are areas where we're seeing new advertisers, retained advertisers and growing advertisers, those again, would be kind of the at home fitness, online education, retail stores as they pivot to omni-channel as well as restaurants offering online ordering and delivery services, mobile banking. I could go on, but the call is short. So just wanted to kind of give that over overall take look, and then I can turn it over for the second part of your question.\nEvan Spiegel: Hey Heath, it\u2019s Evan. Thanks for the question on engagement. We\u2019re really excited about what we\u2019re seeing, obviously, on the content platform, as we mentioned, where a content consumption has grown more than 40% year-over-year, and also in terms of growth and unique, same thing that we\u2019re seeing in the camera, huge increase in Snap creation, which has outpaced DAU growth. And what we\u2019re really excited about is this new action bar we rolled out at SPS, which actually elevates all of these different platforms and creates more surface area for people to engage with all of our products across Snapchat. And so we actually think that\u2019s going to be a great way for people to get to know Snapchat when they first sign up. As you mentioned when people sign up, they do evolve their behavior over time as they get to know the service. And so by removing friction from that process and helping people transition across all of our different platforms, it can really unlock more value from Snapchat. So we\u2019re really excited about what we\u2019re seeing across the platform, lots of great momentum and engagement, which is driving the business overall.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Levine of Pivotal Research Group. Please go ahead.\nMichael Levine: Thanks for the question guys. Both Evan and Jeremi, you guys had referenced dynamic product ads. I\u2019d love to hear a little bit more about that. Specifically, I mean, do you have a sense of what percentage of adoption you think you could see out of commerce advertisers? And I guess just around adoption in general, like are advertisers ready for this at this point in time or what do they need to do to get their ducks in a row to be able to go ahead and start giving you guys the product catalog. Thank you so much.\nJeremi Gorman: Sure. Thank you for the question, Michael. Yes, we are really excited about how Dynamic Ads are going. We\u2019re seeing strong growth globally and we\u2019re excited to build on the success and learnings of our initial U.S. rollout. We now have solid early success stories in MENA, Europe and in Canada. And it\u2019s an area in which we will continue to invest. We are really, really excited about the progress ahead of the holidays and seeing the adoption across a number of verticals. Advertisers are absolutely ready for this. It\u2019s designed similar to other products in the market and Dynamic Ads is now processing over $100 million products per day from catalog, which provide a list of rich set of items that Snapchatters are interested in engaging with and are the most relevant to them. It\u2019s a huge milestone in our pursuit of always on budgets as it pertains e-commerce in particular, but could also utilize more broadly as we continue to grow. And as the name suggests, it dynamically updates based on the catalog, and we will always be relevant as advertisers continue to adopt this technology.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thanks. A couple, if I can. First, last quarter you said the upfront commitments doubled this year. Wondering if most of that spend is kind of planned for the second half or if it\u2019s already been flowing through first half results. And do you feel like, it\u2019s a reliable commitment given everything going on this year. And then I guess just secondly, going back to the DAU growth you said, it did improve each quarter, but it was a little below your expectations. Anything in particular you\u2019d point to as to what came in below expectations, like, was any of it related to kind of maybe this new navigation bar? Is that performing in line with expectations? Anything you could share would be helpful. Thanks.\nJeremi Gorman: Sure. I can take the part about the upfronts. We\u2019re really happy with the progress that we\u2019ve seen with upfront bookings and we\u2019re excited that brands and agencies have confidence in our platform and advertisers are committed to working with us in an always on way, given the return on ad spend that they\u2019re experiencing. In this particular time marketers are extremely focused on ROI. Even though they always are, right now is even more critical. Every dollar spent is a dollar that matters and we continue to deliver that. Our upfront commitments are a tangible sign that for many advertisers we\u2019ve graduated from the experimental budget into a core part of their strategy. And the doubling of commitments in 2020 is just further evidence that we\u2019re becoming increasingly important for our partners. As it pertains to what we\u2019re seeing thus far, we are working with our partners to be flexible with upfronts in case they need to shift spending from one quarter to another. So examples of that would be something that I used earlier, Temple movie for instance moved from Q2 to Q3. We are being very flexible about the timing of the spend, but we haven\u2019t seen a significant inbound request to make material changes.\nDerek Andersen: Hey there, it\u2019s Derek speaking. I can take the second part of your question there. Just in terms of the texture of the DAU growth in the quarter. I think early in the quarter, we were really pleased with what we saw in terms of a lift of engagement as widespread shelter in place orders were in place and sustained. And we saw an initial lift in the frequency of engagement there that contributed to a lift in DAU. And we were pleased with that. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks diminish faster than we had anticipated in our estimate, which is why we came in at approximately $1 million below our estimate that we\u2019d given on the prior call. But I also shared there that we saw sequential growth in DAU from April to May and then again from May to June, so continued our growth there. In terms of your question about the new NAV or not a big factor in the quarter, but I would know that we\u2019re pleased with their early results there, as with all new products that we launched. We have gone through rigorous testing to make sure that it would be audited to the community. And we\u2019re pleased with what we\u2019re seeing in terms of early results there. So thanks for the question and hopefully that additional context is helpful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC. Please go ahead.\nMark Mahaney: Thanks. Is there anything that you\u2019re doing actively to try to resuscitate growth in ROW, you did call it out as an area of weakness, but is there anything that are those mostly macro factors or anything you can do to accelerate that growth? And then secondly, we have a lot of political ads coming out online I don\u2019t, if $3 billion or $4 billion, but it\u2019s a big chunky number. And I know you are making it a point to show as much transparency around the ads as possible, but what are you doing to tap into those ad dollars? I would think that part of that demo you have, will be key to both parties. I would think in these elections coming up and I would think it\u2019d be a good place to message to them. But are you trying to trying to tap into those dollars that political ad spent? Thanks a lot.\nDerek Andersen: Mark, thanks for the question. This is Derek speaking. I\u2019ll take the first part of your question, which is with respect to the growth rate that we saw in Rest of World. In recent quarters, as you\u2019d likely noted, Rest of World has often been our fastest growing region for revenue. So we were definitely disappointed with the 2% year-over-year growth in Q2. Unfortunately, the Rest of World region for revenue was more significantly impacted by several COVID related factors than our other regions, including some of the items, I mentioned in our prepared remarks, such as restrictions on cash transactions and interruptions to supply chains impacted both physical and e-commerce retail. What I would add though, is that fortunately we\u2019ve seen since then the revenue growth rates in the Rest of World region begin to rebound, and this is contributing in part to the better results that we\u2019re seeing thus far in Q3. So happy with the trends that we\u2019re seeing there now, although the interruptions and disruptions that we experienced in Q2 are disappointing things are looking much better now. I\u2019ll turn it over to Jeremi to handle the second part of your question.\nJeremi Gorman: Sure. So as it pertains to political ads, yes, it\u2019s a segment that we are actively going after we serve 90% of 13 year to 24 year olds in the U.S. and 75% of 13 year to 34 year olds in the U.S. So educating them, allowing them to learn more about the issues, any factual based manner is super critical and we are, that is the segment in which we\u2019re working. To ensure transparency in political advertising on Snapchat, all political issue and advocacy ads are publicly available along with relevant information on impression spends and paying entities and our Snap political and advocacy ad library. We have very specific guidelines for political advertising that apply to ads related to elections and advocacy issues. But most broadly, we do believe that Snapchat can play an important role in getting first time voters engaged with our democracy. And we look forward to providing a responsible path for our community to engage with their elected officials, candidates and campaigns.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks for taking my question. This is James on for Brent. At your Partner Summit, you announced the update to the Snap Map with, with places. Could you go a little deeper into your strategy for building out this particular product? And then curious whether you can comment on how you plan to eventually monetize map and what that timeframe might look like? Thanks a lot.\nEvan Spiegel: Hey, James. Thanks for question. Really excited about what we\u2019re seeing with the map and we think it represents a huge opportunity, because we are personalizing in the map to reflect your view of the world today. Most people use the maps for wayfinding and directions rather than understanding the world around them in a personalized way. And so as we think about adding your friends to the map, and also adding places that are important to you, we feel that the snap map better reflects your view of the world around you. And so over time, we believe that will create a monetization opportunity, because people are using the math to browse to see what their friends are up to see what\u2019s happening at different locations and that sort of mass consumption is different than the A to B wayfinding that typically happens on maps today. So, we\u2019ve taken some intermediate steps in terms of monetization; well, helping local businesses reopen following the COVID lockdown, providing free ad credits and letting them easily create Snap Ads. But we\u2019ll continue to work on those products, especially as we build products around categorizing places and lists, helping recommend places to different friends. We see that as a really big opportunity over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. One for Evan, one for Derek. Evan, just wanted to ask about some of the key initiatives to grow the international user base, especially in Rest of World. Clearly, the Android app rebuild a while back was significant, but what are you most focused on now, as you look to make snap a more global product that has both local and cultural relevancy and then Derek, you\u2019re on obviously, a good path in terms of EBITDA profitability and hitting that last 4Q, can you talk about kind of how that could resume here going forward? And then also, how do you get everything under control, you commented on that in your prepared remarks as well. Thanks.\nEvan Spiegel: Thanks for your question. We're definitely excited about the momentum we're seeing in rest of world and the investments we've made in Android are definitely paying off. There's still work to do, improving performance of the service, minimizing data consumption, working on partnerships to help make that data more affordable around the world. Of course, we're continuing to localize the product and onboard local content, local creators and building local AR experiences which we've seen increased engagement. So definitely lots of investment there, but really excited that the fundamentals are in place. And they're showing up in the growth.\nDerek Andersen: Hey Derek here, I'll take your next two questions there. In terms of the path to profitability, we've not historically provided full-year guidance, however, we did share the beginning of this year that we had set a goal to achieve adjusted EBITDA profitability for the full year in 2020. Obviously a lot has changed in the operating environment since we set that internal goal and our revenue growth rates are currently below our expectations entering the year. Much of our cost structure doesn't vary directly with revenue, so lower revenue growth rates have a fairly direct impact on this path to profitability in the near-term.  We've carefully prioritized our investments, so given these changes in the operating environment, but we remain focused on investing in the long-term growth of our business in order to emerge stronger and better position to deliver sustained profitability over the longer term. We've given fairly clear guidance on our intended level of investment heading into Q3 and that level of investment won't vary much with revenue in the quarter. So, absent significant improvement in the operating environment and resulting sustained improvement in revenue growth rates, we don't expect to achieve that internal goal for fiscal 2020. We will continue to prioritize building towards the same profitability and positive free cash flow over the long-term though, so that we can emerge stronger. And then to further expand on your question about SBC and managing that, we think stock-based compensation is amongst our largest expense buckets and has also been a contributor obviously to the growth in fully diluted shares over time. So we view careful management of our stock-based compensation program so it is a really key input to efficiently managing our fully diluted shares over time. So while we have continued to grow our team, we've seen stock-based compensation decline year-over-year by approximately 5% in total on the most recent quarter. And by just over 20% on a per capita basis, this decline comes as our team continues to migrate towards sustainable and competitive compensation structures that we've put in place in the years following our IPO, including additional investments in cash compensation programs. And we'll continue to optimize these programs over time to ensure our programs are both sustainable and competitive. Due in part to this careful management of these programs, we've begun to see the rate of growth in fully diluted shares diminish in addition to the stock-based compensation coming down. So we've actually seen the rate of growth in fully diluted shares declined to between 3% and 4% in the last couple of quarters versus 5% to 6% in the prior year. So we're paying very close attention to this. We understand that the key input to building shareholder value over the long-term and we're carefully focused on managing it. We also believe that if we can continue to scale the top line and manage our investments carefully, that we'll be able to make additional investment and progress towards positive free cash flow over time. And of course this will also open up additional avenues in the long-term to manage these factors over time. So hopefully that gives you a little bit more context on both the path of the profitability as well as how we're managing really a key portion of our cost base.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Justin Post of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJustin Post: Great. A couple of questions, obviously a lot of interest in the acceleration in July. Just wondering we know first half of June was rough for the industry. Did you see a big improvement from the second half of June into July? I wonder if you could help us at all with that. And then secondly, just wondering about how you see the discover content and gaming content pipeline in the second half, a lot of interesting stuff going on there. Just do you expect more shows and more content in the second half then what you were able to put out in the first half? Thanks a lot.\nDerek Andersen: Hey, Justin, it's Derek speaking. I can take the first part just in terms of what we saw on a revenue growth rate. Obviously we saw the full-year \u2013 the full quarter growth rate at 17% was above where we started. But as we mentioned, there were some interruptions within the quarter as we saw some pauses to swap out creative and so on. So we've obviously seen some improvement more recently and as we noted the quarter-to-date result is obviously much better early in July here. So it's been uneven in terms of the trajectory to get to this point. But obviously things have improved more recently for all of the reasons that we've noted earlier and I\u2019ll turn it over to take the second part of your question there.\nEvan Spiegel: Thanks for the question. Yes, we're super excited about the content and gaming pipeline, and also our new Minis product, which has just released more widely. We're really excited about all the experiences that developers are creating to bring friends together to do stuff in Snapchat. So that is super exciting and will make more fun back half of the year.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Please go ahead.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question, maybe two quick ones if I can. Evan, there has been some talk out of the U.S. government about exploring the role of TikTok in the U.S. market. You've commented on some of the social media landscape and some of the regulatory landscape, I wanted to know if you had to take on that potential action by the U.S. government. What it might mean broadly for the landscape, not only just in the U.S. but globally, when you think out over the next couple of years? That would be question number one. Question number two, maybe you should look out into Q3 and Q4 and the recovery takes maybe a firmer footing, is there a dynamic out there that there should be this wide divergence in performance in the business on a region-by-region basis or at tough comps? Do you guys see a reason why the business should much more become aligned over time in terms of overall growth rates? Just wanting to get the bigger picture question in there. Thanks so much.\nEvan Spiegel: Sure. Thanks for the question. Yes, I think it's been really interesting to watch the United States government grapple with huge success of consumer technology company that is headquartered in China. I think that really brings us to more of like a free markets question, as these businesses are able to leverage the massive billion plus consumer base and obviously second largest economy in the world and China and leverage their success there to enter the United States market, which is a smaller market in terms of people. So it's been really fascinating to see the government grapple with this obviously the national security concerns notwithstanding. So I'm not totally sure what the path looks like from here, but you're right to note that the \u2013 I think the ecosystem has shifted a little bit with the success of consumer technologies from China. I think the really fascinating question that a lot of people are asking about, people really assume that the next big consumer tech hit would be a startup. And in this case actually the next consumer tech hit here in the United States seems to be a very large Chinese conglomerate that offers many services around the world. So I think that has maybe reformulated people's conceptions of the tech landscape here in the United States. And we're definitely interested in seeing how this all develops.\nDerek Andersen: Hey, Eric, it's Derek speaking, I can take the second part of that question there. I think in terms of forward looking on growth rate by region, what I would say there is obviously the conditions that we're operating here in terms of the operating environment are really uncertain, I think for the \u2013 at least the coming quarter, and that's why we've not chosen to provide formal guidance this quarter. So I don't think we're really in a position until we better understand how the operating environment is going to recover to really give specific commentary on what we can expect on a growth rate basis by quarter. Obviously, we're hopeful that we'll see the trends that we've seen more recently persist, and therefore, see demand build, but we also understand that the operating environment has been particularly uncertain recently, and there is always the possibility that the macro environment could deteriorate. So we want to be prepared for shifting environment as we go forward and obviously hopeful that things would continue to improve, but it'll depend on the operating environment in large part. So hopefully that gives you a little better sense of how we're thinking about it, at least in the coming quarter.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session, as well as Snap Inc\u2019s second quarter 2020 earnings conference call.

            "name": "Derek Andersen",
            "content": "Thanks Jeremi. Our Q2 financial results reflect our priorities of growing our community, making focused investments in the future of our business, and scaling our operations efficiently in order to drive towards profitability and positive free cash flow. As Evan mentioned earlier, our community grew to 238 million daily active users in Q2, reflecting year-over-year growth of 17% or 35 million. Growth in our community was robust, however, the final result fell below our earlier estimate of 239 million. At the onset of widespread shelter-in-place orders, as people sought to stay connected and entertained from home, we observed an increase in daily active users that informed our initial estimate. This initial lift dissipated faster than we anticipated as shelter-in-place conditions persisted. Despite the unusual circumstances influencing user growth in the quarter, we were pleased with the overall level of growth and that growth continued month-over-month from April to May and May to June. The growth in our community continued to be broad based in Q2. In North America, DAU grew by 9% year-over-year to reach 90 million. In Europe, DAU grew by 12% to reach 71 million. In Rest of World, DAU grew by 37% to reach 77 million. The outsized growth in Rest of World follows the rebuild of our Android application in 2019, and our subsequent efforts to further localize the product. A good example of this momentum can be seen in India, where daily active users more than doubled year-over-year in Q2. We see a significant opportunity to continue to grow our community as we further invest in localization of our product through language support, local content, and marketing partnerships across a variety of geographies. Q2 revenue was $454 million, an increase of 17% year-over-year. While our growth rate for the full quarter exceeded the early quarter-to-date result we shared in our prior call, the path to this outcome was not a straight line. The operating environment has remained challenging as COVID-19 continues to impact macroeconomic conditions, and the businesses of our advertising clients. Many of our advertisers have seen interruptions in their businesses, especially those that rely on in-person interaction with their customers such as restaurants, entertainment venues, transportation services, physical retailers, and hospitality providers among others. In addition, many advertisers paused spending for periods of time during the quarter in order to swap out their ad creative for messaging that was more appropriate for the given moment. These challenging circumstances interrupted otherwise robust momentum in our self-serve platform. We continue to see strong adoption of our goal based bidding products, driven by demand for down funnel bidding objectives, including pixel-verified purchases, pixel-verified subscriptions, app purchases, and other objectives that are tied to directly measurable returns on ad spending. For example, revenue from pixel-verified purchases increased more than 4x year-over-year in Q2, and is now among our most important goal based bidding products. From a regional perspective, our North America revenue grew 18% year-over-year in Q2, or roughly in line with the business overall. In Europe, revenue grew 30% year-over-year as the end of stay at home orders in Europe has contributed to an improving operating environment in this region. In addition, Europe was relatively less impacted by advertisers pausing spend to swap out creative messaging in Q2. In Rest of World, revenue grew 2% year-over-year in Q2 with the relatively lower growth rate reflecting COVID-19 related operating headwinds that were more pronounced for our advertising partners in this region, including limitations on cash transactions in some countries where cash transactions remain important to direct response advertisers, and supply chain issues that impacted certain ecommerce categories more significantly in this region, among other factors. ARPU was stable in Q2 as year-over-year growth in daily active users was approximately equal to year-over-year growth in revenue. Higher sell-through of impressions, and strong growth in content engagement, have contributed to nearly doubling year-over-year in Q2. As a result, eCPM declined 24% year-over-year in Q2, which is roughly in line with the decline observed in the prior quarter. While we aspire to achieve a market level eCPM for our audiences and ad units over time, relatively lower eCPM's in the near term position us well to attract and retain new advertisers by helping to deliver an attractive return on ad spend. Gross margins were 47% in Q2, up one percentage point versus the prior year. Infrastructure costs per DAU were $0.69 in Q2, which is the lowest cost per DAU we have reported since Q1 of 2017, and comes on the heels of our annual infrastructure cost camp where our engineers dedicate time to infrastructure efficiency projects that go above and beyond our ongoing cost management programs. On the content side, we have been doubling down on our investments in premium content, and we are seeing productive returns on these investments with the daily average number of Snapchatters watching Shows growing more than 45% year-over-year in Q2. In addition, we continue to see our overall Discover audience mature, with the daily average number of Snapchatters in the 35 and over age group engaging with Discover content growing at a rate of more than 40% in Q2. We are particularly pleased that we have been able to grow our community at a robust rate, and make investments in premium content, while continuing to expand our gross margins. Operating expenses were $307 million in Q2, up 19% year-over-year. This increase reflects continued investment in our talent base, driven primarily by growth in our engineering and monetization teams. We've observed a steady and significant improvement in employee retention over the past year, and this has helped ensure that the investments in our talent base are highly productive, which is evidenced by the product innovation showcased during our recent partner summit. We have also made investments in marketing to grow our advertiser base and Snapchatter community, which have contributed in part to robust growth in these areas. These investments have been partially offset by savings related to lower travel and event related spending while our teams largely continue to work from home. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $96 million in Q2, or $17 million unfavorable versus the prior year. While we have carefully prioritized our investments given the uncertain operating environment, we have remained focused on investing in the long-term growth of our business in order to build on the momentum we have established with our community, and our advertising partners. While this has put downward pressure on adjusted EBITDA in the near term, we believe it is the right decision for the long-term health of our business given the strength of our balance sheet. Operating income in Q2 was negative $311 million, or $6 million unfavorable versus the prior year, as lower stock-based compensation partially offset the year-over-year decline in adjusted EBITDA. While we have continued to grow our team, we have seen stock-based compensation decline year-over-year by approximately 5% in total. This decline comes as our team continues to migrate towards sustainable and competitive compensation structures that we have put in place in the years following our IPO. We view careful management of our stock based compensation programs as a key input to efficiently managing our fully diluted shares outstanding as we seek to build shareholder value over the long-term. Net income in Q2 was negative $326 million, or $71 million unfavorable versus the prior year, which reflects the flow through from operating income noted above, higher interest expense related to the convertible notes issued over the course of the past year, and the impact of one-time gains in the prior year related to the disposal of certain assets. Free cash flow was negative $82 million in Q2, an improvement of $21 million year-over-year, as lower adjusted EBITDA, higher interest payments and higher capital spending were more than offset by improvements in net working capital as we continue to scale our business efficiently. We ended Q2 with $2.8 billion in cash and marketable securities, up from $2.1 billion at the end of Q1, which reflects the proceeds of the convertible notes issued in Q2. When combined with our undrawn credit facility, we currently have access to approximately $4 billion in total capital, which ensures we have the working capital necessary to stay focused on the long-term regardless of the operating environment. Similar to last quarter, we do not intend to provide financial guidance for Q3, but we do want to provide a sense for where we are today and how we plan to invest in our business. Thus far in Q3 we estimate year-over-year revenue growth to be 32% through July 19. While we are cautiously optimistic that these trends could sustain over time, we are also conscious that operating conditions may remain volatile, and that economic conditions could further deteriorate. For example, advertising demand in Q3 has historically been bolstered by factors that appear unlikely to materialize in the same way they have in prior years, including the back to school season, film release schedules, and the operations of various sports leagues. At this point in time it is difficult to predict how these factors may impact advertising demand in the remainder of Q3. Our best estimate at this point is that our full quarter revenue growth rate is likely to be below our quarter-to-date estimated actual growth rate, and as a result we have built our internal investment plan based on revenue growth of approximately 20%. We intend to continue to invest in our business in Q3 and our estimates for our cost structure assume that daily active users will be between 242 million and 244 million in Q3. This implies year-over-year growth of approximately 15% to 16% or 32 million to 34 million daily active users. On the expense side, we currently expect that our combined cost of revenue and operating costs, which are included in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, will grow year-over-year in Q3 at percentage rates in the low to mid-20s, as we continue to invest in the long-term growth of our business. Given that a small minority of our cost structure varies directly with revenue in the short-term, we do not currently expect substantial variance in the cost growth estimate regardless of the revenue outcome in Q3. While there is continued uncertainty about near-term revenue growth rates given the challenging operating environment, we are pleased with the strength of the underlying momentum in our Snapchatter and advertiser communities, and we remain highly optimistic about the long-term prospects for our business. Thank you for joining our call today and we will now take your questions. Hey, Rich, it's Derek speaking. I'll take the first part of your question there around the growth. I think the first thing that I'd share is we've been pleased with the growth trajectory of our community over the past year. The 35 million DAU that we added in Q2 was among our highest quarters of absolute year-over-year growth that we've seen since 2017. Following the rebuild of our Android application in early 2019 and our subsequent efforts to localize our product, we've seen elevated growth rates in the Rest of World region. And I noted specifically some of the gains we've made in India in my prepared remarks. We've also seen fairly healthy growth rates in our more established markets in regions of North America and Europe. Our estimates for DAU in Q3 are for 15% to 16% year-over-year growth, which as you noted is 1% to 2% below the year-over-year growth rate we observed in Q2. And I can share some further context on that. First, I would note that Q3 of the prior year reflects the full quarter benefit of AR products we launched in the middle of Q2 of 2019. So this contributes to a tougher year-over-year comp this coming quarter. In addition, the sequential growth in Q3 is typically seasonally lower than Q2 and our estimates for the sequential growth in Q3 take this into account. So after taking these factors into consideration, we believe our estimates for Q3 reflect the continuation of the healthy underlying growth trends that we've observed in the business over the past year. So we continue to see a lot of opportunities to grow our community over the long-term. And we are focused on investing in our product to realize this opportunity as a result. This is why we've shared our plans to continue to invest in our talent base, our premium content and marketing in addition to our efforts to further localize our product over time. So thanks again for the question. I hope you find this additional context helpful. I'll turn it over to Jeremi to handle the second part there. Hey there, it's Derek speaking. I can take the second part of your question there. Just in terms of the texture of the DAU growth in the quarter. I think early in the quarter, we were really pleased with what we saw in terms of a lift of engagement as widespread shelter in place orders were in place and sustained. And we saw an initial lift in the frequency of engagement there that contributed to a lift in DAU. And we were pleased with that. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks diminish faster than we had anticipated in our estimate, which is why we came in at approximately $1 million below our estimate that we'd given on the prior call. But I also shared there that we saw sequential growth in DAU from April to May and then again from May to June, so continued our growth there. In terms of your question about the new NAV or not a big factor in the quarter, but I would know that we're pleased with their early results there, as with all new products that we launched. We have gone through rigorous testing to make sure that it would be audited to the community. And we're pleased with what we're seeing in terms of early results there. So thanks for the question and hopefully that additional context is helpful. Mark, thanks for the question. This is Derek speaking. I'll take the first part of your question, which is with respect to the growth rate that we saw in Rest of World. In recent quarters, as you'd likely noted, Rest of World has often been our fastest growing region for revenue. So we were definitely disappointed with the 2% year-over-year growth in Q2. Unfortunately, the Rest of World region for revenue was more significantly impacted by several COVID related factors than our other regions, including some of the items, I mentioned in our prepared remarks, such as restrictions on cash transactions and interruptions to supply chains impacted both physical and e-commerce retail. What I would add though, is that fortunately we've seen since then the revenue growth rates in the Rest of World region begin to rebound, and this is contributing in part to the better results that we're seeing thus far in Q3. So happy with the trends that we're seeing there now, although the interruptions and disruptions that we experienced in Q2 are disappointing things are looking much better now. I'll turn it over to Jeremi to handle the second part of your question. Hey Derek here, I'll take your next two questions there. In terms of the path to profitability, we've not historically provided full-year guidance, however, we did share the beginning of this year that we had set a goal to achieve adjusted EBITDA profitability for the full year in 2020. Obviously a lot has changed in the operating environment since we set that internal goal and our revenue growth rates are currently below our expectations entering the year. Much of our cost structure doesn't vary directly with revenue, so lower revenue growth rates have a fairly direct impact on this path to profitability in the near-term.

And we'll continue to optimize these programs over time to ensure our programs are both sustainable and competitive. Due in part to this careful management of these programs, we've begun to see the rate of growth in fully diluted shares diminish in addition to the stock-based compensation coming down. So we've actually seen the rate of growth in fully diluted shares declined to between 3% and 4% in the last couple of quarters versus 5% to 6% in the prior year. So we're paying very close attention to this. We understand that the key input to building shareholder value over the long-term and we're carefully focused on managing it. We also believe that if we can continue to scale the top line and manage our investments carefully, that we'll be able to make additional investment and progress towards positive free cash flow over time. And of course this will also open up additional avenues in the long-term to manage these factors over time. So hopefully that gives you a little bit more context on both the path of the profitability as well as how we're managing really a key portion of our cost base. Hey, Justin, it's Derek speaking.

Hey, Eric, it's Derek speaking, I can take the second part of that question there. I think in terms of forward looking on growth rate by region, what I would say there is obviously the conditions that we're operating here in terms of the operating environment are really uncertain, I think for the \u2013 at least the coming quarter, and that's why we've not chosen to provide formal guidance this quarter. So I don't think we're really in a position until we better understand how the operating environment is going to recover to really give specific commentary on what we can expect on a growth rate basis by quarter. Obviously, we're hopeful that we'll see the trends that we've seen more recently persist, and therefore, see demand build, but we also understand that the operating environment has been particularly uncertain recently, and there is always the possibility that the macro environment could deteriorate. So we want to be prepared for shifting environment as we go forward and obviously hopeful that things would continue to improve, but it'll depend on the operating environment in large part. So hopefully that gives you a little better sense of how we're thinking about it, at least in the coming quarter."

            "content": "Thank you, Evan. We're pleased with our results for this quarter amidst a challenging and evolving global environment and we continue to see significant upside and opportunity for our business as we support our community and advertising partners. In Q2, we generated total revenue of $454 million, an increase of 17% year-over-year. We are confident that our business is well-positioned for the long-term, evidenced by the resilience we are seeing with direct response advertisers, as well as our continued success helping brands craft valuable messages and effectively reach our community. We've had a lot of conversations within Snap about how our team, our products, and our business can be forces for positive change in the world. In the U.S., our platform reaches 90% of 13 to 24 year olds and 75% of 13 to 34 year olds. This audience is critical for advertisers as the Snapchat Generation develops lifelong habits, but also because young people are focused on driving change in the world and building a better future. We take our responsibility to educate, inform, and support this incredible generation very seriously and we've committed to using our business as a force for good. Given the relationship we have built with the Snapchat community worldwide, we've been able to help brands deliver timely messages that resonate with 13 to 34 year olds, who see the world differently than their parent's generation. This is particularly important against the backdrop of current events, as advertisers look to appropriately align their messages with what our community seeks; positivity, good will, and most-importantly, authenticity. We have partnered with many brands in verticals that are well-positioned in the current environment, such as consumer packaged goods, gaming, streaming, and e-commerce, while also helping our partners with recovery roadmaps for industries that have experienced an outsized impact from COVID-19. We had the opportunity to work closely with Monster Energy to adapt a new campaign for Snapchat in response to stay-at-home orders with their #CrushQuarantine campaign across Snap Ads, Commercials, Story Ads and Lenses. Monster's multi-ad product exposure ultimately generated a 12 point lift in ad awareness and a 5 point lift in message association. Our large audience, creative formats and advanced measurement tools provided a significant opportunity for brands such as Monster Energy to reach Snapchatters during the global pandemic. Our team has also been working hard to provide useful products and resources for businesses as they manage the current economic landscape. We added multi-country targeting capabilities, allowing advertisers to optimize for the best performing customers, regardless of location, catering to location agnostic products and services, like commerce, fintech, and games. In addition, we launched Places on our Snap Map, which highlights businesses that are popular with our community and offers information like hours, reviews, and delivery options via third party partners. While we are just getting started with this opportunity, as parts of the world begin to reopen safely, we will be there to help the Snapchat Generation support their favorite local businesses and discover new ones. We remain focused on making progress against our ARPU opportunity through our three key priorities. First, investing in our ad platform in order to drive improved relevance and deliver measurable ROI. Second, efficiently scaling our sales and marketing functions to support our advertising partners globally. And third, building innovative ad experiences through video and augmented reality that deliver real business value. Our three priorities along with our unique reach and growing, global audience allow us to drive performance at scale. Since completing the transition to our self-serve ad platform, we have been able to reliably translate improvements in relevance, optimization, and measurement into revenue growth by delivering increased ROI. During a time of disruption, marketers must make difficult decisions. They need flexibility, creativity and strong relationships, but most importantly, they need performant media. Advertisers are becoming more performance-oriented, and the economic conditions only accelerated that trend this quarter. Our flexible and advanced self-serve platform, our strong suite of performance ad products, and our relentless focus on measurement and ROI, continue to help our advertising partners deliver positive results. The global health crisis has also accelerated the shift to a more digital economy. Our advertising partners are exploring more ways to offer services digitally, including at-home fitness apps, online education programs, retail stores and restaurants offering online ordering and delivery services, and mobile-first banking and trading. This crisis is encouraging all business owners to adopt digital marketing methods to engage with their customers globally, and we are well-positioned to take advantage of this shift. Our early investments in building the fundamentals of our global business have paid off, and have resulted in our highest number of active advertisers to date this quarter. We've built a full suite of ad products designed to meet advertisers' needs in this new world, particularly for ecommerce, such as swipe-to-call, pixel-verified purchase, app re-engagement, and Dynamic Ads. We recently launched Dynamic Ads globally, and we are finding that advertisers are already seeing early success with this new ad format. Rob Seidu, Senior Director of Media Activation at Adidas, said \"In the wake of the COVID-19 epidemic, Adidas has further accelerated its digital business. With ecommerce a key focus for us in 2020 and beyond, we were excited to Beta test Snapchat's Dynamic Ads in the UK, Germany, France and the Netherlands. Within weeks we saw 52% growth in return on advertising spend and we have subsequently grown our investment.\" More and more e-commerce businesses are adopting our Snap pixel to optimize for down-funnel purchase objectives, demonstrating the increased demand we are seeing from businesses measuring campaigns via first party attribution. For example, in Q2 2020 Chipotle launched a new free delivery campaign on Snapchat to drive purchases both on Chipotle.com and within their app. Their campaign drove over 3x the number of attributed purchases compared to their Q1 2020 campaign and 171% increase in return on ad spend compared to the prior quarter. We remain focused on helping businesses such as Chipotle translate measurement and optimization into meaningful conversions and strong ROI. Our second priority is to grow demand through better service of our advertising partners. We continue to hire talented sales professionals to build out and improve our verticalized coverage that serves many advertisers across the globe. While we are not able to host in-person meetings with our advertising partners, our teams have quickly pivoted efforts to virtual industry education, and our team has led thought-leadership webinars during quarantine and partnered with many industry leaders like Shopify and Smartly.io to further educate advertisers about our robust ad tools and capabilities. We are also supporting advertisers by building out more on-demand learning tools such as Snap Focus, which includes six learning courses that walks through everything advertisers need to know to create their first ad campaign. Our third priority is to lead the way with innovative advertising. Over the past five years, we've been building a powerful video business with the goal of connecting brands and advertisers to the Snapchat Generation. For example, COVERGIRL Clean Fresh came to Snapchat to get in front of the hard-to- reach Gen Z and Millennial female audience. Their campaign leaned heavily into Premium Video, featuring Snap Select Commercials, Snap Ads and Filters. Of the total audience reach, 62% was unique to Snap. The campaign drove a 9 point lift in Ad Awareness, and a lift in Purchase Intent that was 4.5x the Snap US CPG Norm. This is just one example of many that signals a broader shift in how Gen Z and Millennials consume content. It is getting harder and harder to reach this audience on linear TV or commercial-supported streaming, and it is not just the younger generations, average daily Discover content viewership by people over 35% has increased by over 40% year-over-year. Based on this growth and in response to the evolving needs of our advertising partners, we introduced First Commercial, giving advertisers a way to reserve the first Commercial a Snapchatter sees during the first Show they watch, allowing brands to make that all-important first impression. Our Commercials are designed for both Social Video and Online Video buyers, with the goal of attracting incremental Online Video and TV budgets into our hand-curated, brand-safe content environment. In fact, the content on our Discover platform is brand-safe by design. In order to provide advertisers with fixed priced, reserved inventory next to this content, we introduced Snap Select, where ads only appear in our hand-curated selection of Shows and content from media brands like ESPN, NBC, and People. In Q2 we expanded our Snap Select curated ad placement options to five topics, 'Sports', 'Entertainment', 'Beauty', 'Lifestyle', and 'News', enabling advertisers to reach viewers within each vertical. We believe that the future of customer interactions is immersive. The most engaging and creative ads on our platform are powered by our augmented reality Lenses. Brands from every vertical have worked with us to provide Snapchatters with fun ads that they play with and share with friends. Ultimately we want to enable advertisers with the tools to build the digital layer around their products. For example, we recently launched our augmented reality Lens \u2018try-on' campaign with luxury brand Gucci, which allows Snapchatters to virtually try on and purchase some of Gucci's most iconic shoes via Snapchat. The Lens was played with by our community for 22 seconds on average and in some markets generated a five times Return on Ad Spend. Snapchatters are actively looking for more and more ways to engage with brands on our platform, and we're excited to help partners like Gucci connect with them  during this time. We believe that AR try-on is going to be incredibly important to the future of commerce and we are excited to work with more partners to build out incredible experiences for our community. Longer-term, we see a significant opportunity for brands to provide utility for Snapchatters while generating real business value across our service \u2013 not just via ads in content. Brands are starting to invest in Snapchat beyond advertising by building fun, engaging, and useful experiences for Snapchatters. The launch of Brand Profiles this month, which Evan highlighted earlier, is a key pillar of this future. Today, our focus is on giving Brands a home for all the innovative AR experiences that they create, alongside their stories. In the future, we believe that Snapchatters will engage naturally with businesses of all sizes across our service. For a brand like Target, this could mean they visit the Target Store on the Map to check store hours; use a Mini to find the best offers with friends; try on the latest looks via an AR Lens; and more. In the five years since we launched ads on Snapchat, we've created the industry's first-ever vertical video format, brought branded AR experiences to the mainstream, and pioneered privacy-safe, mobile- first advertising in order to help advertisers everywhere reach our community. We will continue to invest for the long-term by demonstrating measurable ROI for our advertising partners, empowering our teams to speak strategically to the value of our ads, and leading the way with innovative advertising products and services to help advertisers scale. We've built a robust advertising platform to reach the Snapchat Generation, who are digitally native and uniquely positioned to help jumpstart the recovery. Given our young and influential community, their depth of engagement on our platform, and our overall opportunity to take share of the growing digital advertising market, we believe we are well- positioned to drive business results for advertisers over the long-term. With that, I'll turn the call over to Derek. Great, thank you, Rich for the question. I want to speak specifically about the Facebook boycott to your question. It is difficult to ascertain exactly what the impact of the Facebook boycott is on revenue at this time. Some of the Facebook boycott could also be related to overall content marketing budgets, just given the environment. What we do know is that it's always positive to engage at the highest levels of an organization. And this conversation has opened the door for us to do that extremely frequently at the CEO and CMO level. And in particular, we've been designed in a brand-safe, hand-curated way since the beginning. There is no town hall or ability for an unvetted user to post to our whole community. And as advertisers evaluate platforms, which align with their values, these deliberate decisions made years ago are of paramount importance. With that being said, the majority of our revenue is VR, which is a segment not broadly participating in the boycott. And with the advent of dynamic ads, the addition of worldwide targeting and more, we're continuing to deliver results for those advertisers, which put us in a strong position to gain and retain those advertisers over time, independent of the boycott. Sure. Thanks for the question, Heath. Our early investments to build the fundamentals of our global business have really paid off and they've resulted in our highest number of active advertisers in quarter-to-date this quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we do continue to see strength in categories like CPG streaming at home fitness and tech, and we talked about tourism and dining restaurants earlier, which do continue to be challenged. The sales team does continue to support advertisers of all space currently, whether they are economically challenged or not, so that we can focus on the long-term of the business, but have pivoted our resources towards the advertisers that are continuing to spend in the direct response space. We are continuing to see that strong demand from direct response advertisers, looking for lower funnel data optimization and delivering ROI. I think generally the way to look at it is that the global health crisis has accelerated the shift to a more digital economy. So anything in that category is \u2013 are areas where we're seeing new advertisers, retained advertisers and growing advertisers, those again, would be kind of the at home fitness, online education, retail stores as they pivot to omni-channel as well as restaurants offering online ordering and delivery services, mobile banking. I could go on, but the call is short. So just wanted to kind of give that over overall take look, and then I can turn it over for the second part of your question. Sure. Thank you for the question, Michael. Yes, we are really excited about how Dynamic Ads are going. We're seeing strong growth globally and we're excited to build on the success and learnings of our initial U.S. rollout. We now have solid early success stories in MENA, Europe and in Canada. And it's an area in which we will continue to invest. We are really, really excited about the progress ahead of the holidays and seeing the adoption across a number of verticals. Advertisers are absolutely ready for this. It's designed similar to other products in the market and Dynamic Ads is now processing over $100 million products per day from catalog, which provide a list of rich set of items that Snapchatters are interested in engaging with and are the most relevant to them. It's a huge milestone in our pursuit of always on budgets as it pertains e-commerce in particular, but could also utilize more broadly as we continue to grow. And as the name suggests, it dynamically updates based on the catalog, and we will always be relevant as advertisers continue to adopt this technology. Sure. I can take the part about the upfronts. We're really happy with the progress that we've seen with upfront bookings and we're excited that brands and agencies have confidence in our platform and advertisers are committed to working with us in an always on way, given the return on ad spend that they're experiencing. In this particular time marketers are extremely focused on ROI. Even though they always are, right now is even more critical. Every dollar spent is a dollar that matters and we continue to deliver that. Our upfront commitments are a tangible sign that for many advertisers we've graduated from the experimental budget into a core part of their strategy. And the doubling of commitments in 2020 is just further evidence that we're becoming increasingly important for our partners. As it pertains to what we're seeing thus far, we are working with our partners to be flexible with upfronts in case they need to shift spending from one quarter to another. So examples of that would be something that I used earlier, Temple movie for instance moved from Q2 to Q3. We are being very flexible about the timing of the spend, but we haven't seen a significant inbound request to make material changes. Sure. So as it pertains to political ads, yes, it's a segment that we are actively going after we serve 90% of 13 year to 24 year olds in the U.S. and 75% of 13 year to 34 year olds in the U.S. So educating them, allowing them to learn more about the issues, any factual based manner is super critical and we are, that is the segment in which we're working. To ensure transparency in political advertising on Snapchat, all political issue and advocacy ads are publicly available along with relevant information on impression spends and paying entities and our Snap political and advocacy ad library. We have very specific guidelines for political advertising that apply to ads related to elections and advocacy issues. But most broadly, we do believe that Snapchat can play an important role in getting first time voters engaged with our democracy. And we look forward to providing a responsible path for our community to engage with their elected officials, candidates and campaigns."

            "name": "Evan Spiegel",
            "content": "Thanks everyone for joining our call. This has been an extremely challenging time, and our team has done an outstanding job continuing to support the growth of our community, which increased 17% year-over-year to 238 million daily active users, as well as building our business, with revenue growing 17% year-over-year to $454 million. While our revenue growth rate continues to be impacted by ongoing market disruptions, the fundamentals of our business are strong, and the high levels of engagement on our service are backed by years of investment in our self-serve advertising platform, which is helping our partners achieve success and grow their businesses in this uncertain environment. I am most proud of our team for the work they did to create our Snap Partner Summit this quarter, which was delivered virtually in an augmented world. We announced several new products like Minis, Voice Scan, Camera Kit, Places on the Snap Map, Bitmoji for third party games, as well as several new partnerships and a fresh slate of content. We also made Snapchat easier to navigate with our new Action Bar which provides top-level navigation to more easily access the Snap Map, Chat, Camera, and Discover, resulting in more surface area and accessibility for each of these platforms. We are working hard to overlay new computing experiences on the world through augmented reality. And the Snap Partner Summit showcased some of our latest AR products, including Local Lenses that allow people to share augmented reality experiences together overlaid on their neighborhood cityscape, and SnapML, which empowers members of our community to bring their machine learning models directly into Lenses on Snapchat. This enabled Gucci to leverage Wannaby's foot-tracking technology to help people try on their latest sneakers in Snapchat, and even buy them directly within the Lens. These sorts of augmented reality experiences are especially powerful in the post-COVID retail environment, where brands are investing more in virtual try-on. In addition to our new augmented reality products, we also released Minis to enable developers to build interactive and social experiences for our community. For example, when movie theaters reopen, friends will be able to browse and purchase tickets together in the upcoming Atom Tickets Mini. We're excited to help our partners understand how they will benefit from our long-term vision for Snap, and the many ways that they can use our products and platform to connect with our community and build their businesses. Our community grew by 17% year-over-year, with 238 million people using Snapchat every day on average in the quarter. This continues our recent momentum in daily active user growth, with the last three quarters seeing our highest year-over-year growth rates since 2017. We now reach more than 100 million people in the U.S. alone, and are also seeing strong growth in our core markets in North America, Europe, and Australia. We are also continuing to invest in app performance and localization to make our service more accessible to people all over the world, with Snapchat now available to over two billion people in their native language. These efforts have helped us grow even faster in emerging markets like India, where we've seen over 100% growth in daily active users over the past year. As the changing public health landscape accelerates the adoption of digital products, we believe there is a large opportunity for us to further empower new behaviors with AR, entertainment, and commerce. For example, we continue to see increasing engagement with our camera, and the number of Snaps created every day grew at double the pace of our daily active user growth over the past year, making Snapchat one of the world's most-used cameras. We're especially excited to see that the adoption of our AR platform is also accelerating, with the number of people playing with Lenses every day growing by 37% year-over-year. This growth has been driven in part by the community of talented Lens creators and partners that are creating and distributing Lenses on Snapchat. Creators are quickly adopting new Lens Studio capabilities to create Lenses that put a lightsaber in your hand, turn the entire world into spaghetti, and let you try on clothes and makeup. Today Snapchatters play with Lenses created by our community six times as often as they did just last year, and these Lenses now drive more than a quarter of all Lens engagement on Snapchat. We are excited to see that our product innovation in AR is empowering the creativity of our Lens creator community, which in turn has driven growth in user engagement. With so much happening around the world today, our Discover platform is more important than ever in helping our community stay educated and informed about current events. Snapchat has become a go-to destination for credible and accurate news content during the pandemic, with more than half of the entire U.S. Gen Z population watching COVID-related news created by our partners. Additionally, following the murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor, we published curated Community Stories featuring powerful Snaps from our community, which ranged from breaking news about peaceful protests to a dialog about what it means to be Living While Black in America. We are also rolling out Happening Now, a dedicated section of Discover that provides breaking news from media partners such as NBC News and ESPN summarized in a single Snap. In addition to news, Discover has also provided a premium mobile entertainment experience for our community as they are sheltering in their homes. For example, Will From Home, which culminated in a Fresh Prince of Bel-Air cast reunion, was watched by more than 35 million people. Snap Originals continue to attract audiences that rival those of top TV series, and have reached more than 75% of the U.S. Gen Z population so far this year. In addition, many of our media partners are finding success adapting their television properties for our platform in order to reach an incremental audience that is not watching TV. According to eMarketer, the average U.S. adult spends 29 more minutes with mobile content compared to TV, which is up from six fewer minutes on mobile in 2018. We believe this trend is driven primarily by the younger generation, whose time spent watching TV is a fraction of their older counterparts'. This creates an opportunity for our media partners, several of whom spend significant resources to create high-quality content for TV, to expand their total audience to include these younger viewers. Several shows that are finding success on Discover were originally shot for linear TV, and these shows have reached an audience of over 100 million people on Snapchat so far this year. We added more than 180 new Discover channels this quarter, and recently announced newly-expanded partnerships with Disney, ESPN, NBC, ViacomCBS, the NBA, and the NFL as we continue to expand our curated content business. The strong engagement with our platform and products is driving results in our advertising business, despite the many macro headwinds currently experienced by our partners. Our advertising business grew 17% year-over-year to $454 million in revenue. We are pleased to see the continuing growth in our revenue especially in the face of extreme dislocations in the market. As heavily-impacted companies like travel and in-theater entertainment pull back spend, we have transitioned to helping them plan for a future recovery led in part by our audience. We have also seen that certain industries like CPG, gaming, streaming services, and e-commerce have benefited from some of the COVID-related changes in consumer behavior, and have been leaning in as advertisers on our platform. Our significant investments over the past few years in our team and our ad platform helped us provide substantial value to both direct response and brand advertisers as they navigate these rapid and unprecedented shifts in the market. Our direct response business continues to drive meaningful return on investment at scale, especially during the current environment, where performance-oriented apps and e-commerce advertisers look to reach customers who are increasingly engaging and transacting on the Internet rather than in-person. This has been accelerated by the major improvements we continue to make to our ad products and backend optimization, which have helped us increase the scale at which we're able to deliver results for direct response advertisers. For example, we are rolling out dynamic ads globally, so that retailers like Sephora and Adidas can run ecommerce campaigns on Snapchat that automatically optimize across their entire catalog. These product improvements also drive a virtuous cycle for our direct response business. As we onboard more advertisers, the increased quality and diversity of our advertising demand means that we have more relevant ads to choose from when deciding which ad to show a particular person at a particular time. This in turn drives more value for advertisers with fewer wasted impressions, while simultaneously reducing the perceived ad load for our community. While these uncertain times have impacted many businesses in different ways, one consistent theme across all brands has been the focus on reaching customers in thoughtful and genuine ways. Brands have collaborated on many of the new products we are building, including by investing heavily in our new AR capabilities to engage an audience that is not able to visit their stores or see their products in person. We recently launched Brand Profiles, an important first step towards building a native home for all of the organic experiences that brands are building. Snapchatters can now visit the profiles of brands like Dior, Target, and Tim Hortons to watch their Stories, play with their AR experiences, and even buy their products through our native commerce integrations. We are excited to evolve our relationships with brands of all sizes as we continue to build tools for brands to organically engage with our audience. Finally, the growing focus on brand safety and privacy across the entire industry places us in a unique position of strength as we have invested in these areas from the beginning of our business. The very foundation of both our consumer product and our advertising business has been built around our commitment to protecting the privacy of our community, and to delivering a safe environment for brands. We believe that building trust with our community and providing a safe environment on Snapchat is critical to our long-term success and helps us live up to the high expectations of both our community and our advertising partners. This reflects our broader commitment to making a positive impact with our company and our products. Our strategy is simple. We try to do the right thing, even when it's hard, and we work to acknowledge and fix our mistakes quickly. Looking forward, we expect that the current operating environment will become more complex, this year alone, we have seen sweeping changes to our global economy, the privacy and regulatory landscape, public health and social behaviors, and the direct confrontation of a legacy of injustice and extreme inequality in America. This means that our strategy of trying to do the right thing isn't just a moral imperative. We believe that it is the only way to achieve the long-term vision for our business. We have a lot to learn as we grow our global audience and expand our advertising and content partnerships, and it gives me great hope to see our team, community, and partners actively engaged in building a better future. Thank you again for joining us today. I'll now turn the call over to Jeremi to share more about our business. Sure. Thanks for the question Ross. I'll give a little bit more color here is that we're really proud of the work that our team did to deliver results for our business. We're working from home and they're challenging operating environment this past quarter and continue to do today. We mentioned this on our prior call that we experienced a growth rate of 15% through the first few weeks of Q2, so our final results of 17% was just above this, but the result wasn't in a straight line. There were periods of time where advertisers had to pause, to reshift, to create of these kinds of things, so it was not straight line. They faced the challenges in their business due to COVID-19 and other interruption. And we also saw a number of advertisers pause spending as time just get adjusted, better suit the moment, but to be specific our direct response business improvement just was resilient and we have continued to benefit from the growth in adoption of our goal-based bidding product and that is driving the continued growth in the top line overall that you are seeing now. As far as some of the other parts, the brand side of the business has begun to recover as revenue growth in the rest of world has recovered. And this is contributing in part to the improved results we've seen this quarter. In addition, we see continued strength in categories like CPG, streaming, home fitness and tech and of course we're continuing to see declines in things like tourism, dining restaurants, while they continue to be challenged in this environment. We're hopeful that the trends that we've observed recently will persist, but we're also conscious that the operating environment does remain challenging. And many of the factors that have historically contributed to the growth of Q3 are unlikely to materialize in the same way this year that they have in prior years. Examples of that would be the start of the NFL season, tent-pole movies being moved out of summer movie season to school, et cetera, all of these things will happen, but just in ways that were a little bit less familiar. So that gives some color hopefully on the cautiousness there. Hey Heath, it's Evan. Thanks for the question on engagement. We're really excited about what we're seeing, obviously, on the content platform, as we mentioned, where a content consumption has grown more than 40% year-over-year, and also in terms of growth and unique, same thing that we're seeing in the camera, huge increase in Snap creation, which has outpaced DAU growth. And what we're really excited about is this new action bar we rolled out at SPS, which actually elevates all of these different platforms and creates more surface area for people to engage with all of our products across Snapchat. And so we actually think that's going to be a great way for people to get to know Snapchat when they first sign up. As you mentioned when people sign up, they do evolve their behavior over time as they get to know the service. And so by removing friction from that process and helping people transition across all of our different platforms, it can really unlock more value from Snapchat. So we're really excited about what we're seeing across the platform, lots of great momentum and engagement, which is driving the business overall. Hey, James. Thanks for question. Really excited about what we're seeing with the map and we think it represents a huge opportunity, because we are personalizing in the map to reflect your view of the world today. Most people use the maps for wayfinding and directions rather than understanding the world around them in a personalized way. And so as we think about adding your friends to the map, and also adding places that are important to you, we feel that the snap map better reflects your view of the world around you. And so over time, we believe that will create a monetization opportunity, because people are using the math to browse to see what their friends are up to see what's happening at different locations and that sort of mass consumption is different than the A to B wayfinding that typically happens on maps today. So, we've taken some intermediate steps in terms of monetization; well, helping local businesses reopen following the COVID lockdown, providing free ad credits and letting them easily create Snap Ads. But we'll continue to work on those products, especially as we build products around categorizing places and lists, helping recommend places to different friends. We see that as a really big opportunity over time. Thanks for your question. We're definitely excited about the momentum we're seeing in rest of world and the investments we've made in Android are definitely paying off. There's still work to do, improving performance of the service, minimizing data consumption, working on partnerships to help make that data more affordable around the world. Of course, we're continuing to localize the product and onboard local content, local creators and building local AR experiences which we've seen increased engagement. So definitely lots of investment there, but really excited that the fundamentals are in place. And they're showing up in the growth. Thanks for the question. Yes, we're super excited about the content and gaming pipeline, and also our new Minis product, which has just released more widely. We're really excited about all the experiences that developers are creating to bring friends together to do stuff in Snapchat. So that is super exciting and will make more fun back half of the year. Sure. Thanks for the question. Yes, I think it's been really interesting to watch the United States government grapple with huge success of consumer technology company that is headquartered in China. I think that really brings us to more of like a free markets question, as these businesses are able to leverage the massive billion plus consumer base and obviously second largest economy in the world and China and leverage their success there to enter the United States market, which is a smaller market in terms of people. So it's been really fascinating to see the government grapple with this obviously the national security concerns notwithstanding. So I'm not totally sure what the path looks like from here, but you're right to note that the \u2013 I think the ecosystem has shifted a little bit with the success of consumer technologies from China. I think the really fascinating question that a lot of people are asking about, people really assume that the next big consumer tech hit would be a startup. And in this case actually the next consumer tech hit here in the United States seems to be a very large Chinese conglomerate that offers many services around the world. So I think that has maybe reformulated people's conceptions of the tech landscape here in the United States. And we're definitely interested in seeing how this all develops."

We hope everyone is staying safe and healthy during this time and we appreciate your understanding as we work through the call. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Evan.\nEvan Spiegel: Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. It's been a very difficult few months for the world, but we remain hopeful and optimistic about the future. As a team, we have been focused on doing our part to help as we all navigate this unimaginable tragedy. We are inspired that people are working together and staying home to save lives and it gives us added faith in humanity to see how deeply we all care about supporting one another during this time. The shared compassion we've all demonstrated towards one another during this crisis gives us confidence that we will all be able to find the right path forward towards a safe, healthy and positive future. At Snap, our first priority is the health and safety of our community, our partners and our team. We closed our first office in January and continued to close offices as COVID-19 spread around the globe. Our team has rallied around maintaining business continuity during this critical time and I'm in awe of how quickly our team adapted to this circumstances and continue to execute against our ongoing opportunities. We are monitoring the current situation daily and are working towards a best case scenario for a rapid recovery, while also preparing for a worst case scenario. Our team remains inspired and motivated despite the challenging circumstances because our product has never been more important in people's lives especially for helping close friends and family stay together emotionally, while they are separated physically. We are seeing sustained communication volumes on our service that eclipse the peaks we see during major holidays. For example, communication with friends increased by over 30% in the last week of March compared to the last week of January with more than 50% increase in some of our larger markets. Snapchat has always been focused on helping people build and maintain their friendships which is especially critical as people practice physical distancing and shelter in their homes. We are working hard to provide our community with factual and up-to-date information as well as resources for their safety and mental health. In the early days of the crisis, we immediately launched multiple filters and lenses featuring safety tips and best practices which quickly reached hundreds of millions of people around the world. We added a new feature called Here For You that provides proactive in app support to Snapchatters who may be experiencing a mental health or emotional crisis, or who may be curious to learn more about these issues and how they can help their friends. We have also published over 700 Discover editions featuring up to the minute coverage on COVID-19 from our content partners, our in-house news teams and agencies like the CDC and WHO, with more than half of the United States Gen Z population watching news content on Discover, we feel it is particularly important for us to educate our audience with curated and trustworthy information during these critical times. We're also trying to help maintain positivity and help our community have fun together during this stressful time. We adapted our annual Snap Map icon to encourage playing from home with friends rather than going out into the world. We have seen a sharp increase in group related activities across chat, calling and games. We launched five new games this quarter and saw average daily time spend in games more than double in the month of March. In addition to news and information Discover now includes programming that celebrates the doctors, teachers, store employees and others in our community who are sharing their experiences from the frontlines. This includes uplifting content like Will From Home, in which Will Smith shares his own shelter in place experience, along with his friends, which garnered over 15 million viewers in its first three episodes. Our community has been incredibly engaged on Snapchat during this period across all of these areas, and average time spent is up over 20% in the last week of March, compared to the last week of January, with some larger markets like France and the U.K. seeing more than a 30% increase. Additionally, as people turn to video conferencing and live streaming to work and hang out together, we've seen more than 30x increase in the daily downloads of Snap Camera, a desktop app which allows people to add our suite of lenses to whichever video conferencing service they use. While supporting our community and partners during the COVID-19 health crisis has been our top priority over the past few months we remain focused on building on the momentum we've established in the growth of our community. Our community grew by 11 million daily active users to an average of 229 million daily active users during Q1, up 5% quarter-over-quarter and 20% year-over-year. Our community is using Snapchat to express themselves and communicate visually creating over 4 billion snaps with our camera every day on average. In addition to the increased usage of our camera, people are spending more and more time on Discover. Our editorial selectivity and curated approach has helped us bring best-in-class mobile content to our community that is accurate, timely and topical. We're continuing to use engagement insights and data to drive our investments in Discover by regularly adding new channels to serve the very needs and tastes of our audience, including 91 new channels around the world this quarter. This has allowed us to take a targeted approach to growing time spent on Discover amongst various demographics and geographies. For example, total daily time spent by snapchatters over the age of 35 watching Discover content doubled year-over-year in Q1 2020. This ongoing investment in the expansion and diversification of our content offerings including favorites, like Comedy Central, The Daily Show with Trevor Noah, and original content like Nikita Unfiltered, a new docuseries has helped deepen engagement on our Discover platform. Augmented reality is continuing to play an important role in the lives of Snapchatters, with people now playing with lenses 85% more each day than they did last year. A lot of this behavior is driven by our growing community of lens creators using lens studio with lenses created by our community reaching 40% of our daily active users every day on average. We've also built new immersive lenses powered by machine learning to transform the ground into lava or water. We believe that the recent acceleration in the adoption of communication technology and augmented reality during these travel restrictions will help support our longer term trends and engagement growth. We generated $462 million of revenue in Q1, representing a 44% year-over-year growth rate. While many advertising budgets declined due to COVID-19, we experienced high revenue growth rates in the first two months of the quarter, which offset our lower growth in March. These high growth rates in the beginning of the quarter reflect our investments in our audience, ad products and optimization and give us confidence in our ability to grow revenue over the long-term. We are seeing some bright spots amongst direct response advertisers, especially those who provide activities or products that our community can enjoy at home. In the short-term, we are shifting sales resources and pulling forward some investments in direct response to better serve the advertisers who are trying to reach our audience during this time. For example, we can help movie studios pivot to digital releases by supporting them with a suite of products designed to track titles over a dynamic and flexible release window. We've also seen many large brands doing a lot of important things to help their community and the broader world and we are helping these brands communicate their efforts to our audience, in a thoughtful and approachable way that inspires others to make a positive impact. In the medium-term, we are helping our partners plan for the road to recovery, which we believe will be led in part by the younger generation. As people are sheltering in their homes, they're increasingly turning to digital behaviors across every aspect of their lives, including communication, commerce, entertainment, fitness and learning. We believe that this will accelerate the digital transformation across many businesses and that the heightened levels of activity we are seeing today will lead to a sustained uplift in the digital economy over time. The Snapchat generation is digitally native and adopts new technologies quickly, which will help them continue to drive this transformation. This makes our audience uniquely positioned to help businesses recover. And we want to do our part to help jumpstart the recovery. While it is difficult to predict the near-term impact of this unprecedented complex and global pandemic on our business, we believe that all of the long-term indicators we see in terms of our audience, their engagement, our momentum on product innovation, our auction dynamics and advertiser ROI, position us very well for success. Our deep investments in direct response advertising over the past few years, including advanced bidding and campaign management tools, ad formats designed specifically for mobile apps and ecommerce and backend performance optimization have positioned us well in this uncertain environment. Our strong cash position allows us to continue to hire and make long-term investments in innovation during this time, while simultaneously prioritizing the health and safety of our community, team and partners. We're beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel in terms of the immediate health crisis, with the curve flattening in many cities and countries. The next chapter will be figuring out what the new normal will look like, both from a logistical perspective, as well as in regard to the physical and mental well being of our team. The third chapter will be the recovery, which we expect may be very fast for some businesses and much slower for others. And we are committed to helping our partners as we navigate this uncertain journey together. The many difficult transitions and changes we made as a business over the past few years have positioned us well for the challenges ahead. We have strong resilient leadership, a growing community that deeply values the service we provide an efficient advertising platform that delivers value for our advertising partners and a relentless pace of innovation, driven by the creativity and operational excellence of our team. I'm so proud of and inspired by our team and the way they have risen to this challenge, while putting the health and safety of our community first. Thanks again for joining the call and with that I will turn it over to Jeremi to share more about our business.\nJeremi Gorman: Thank you, Evan. We're pleased with our results for this quarter amidst a challenging and rapidly evolving global health crisis. And we continue to see significant upside and opportunity for our business as we support our community and advertising partners through this difficult time. In Q1, we generated total revenue of $462 million, an increase of 44% year-over-year and consistent with our year-over-year growth rate in Q4 of last year. We are confident that our business is well positioned for long-term success evidenced by the high revenue growth rates we achieved in the first two months of the quarter, as well as our continued growth in the final month of Q1. The global outbreak of COVID-19 has dramatically shifted the ways brands are thinking about reaching new audiences. While friends and families are physically separated from each other in their regular routines, Snapchatters are coming together virtually to maintain their friendships through visual communication, self expression and storytelling. Our sales teams have been focused on helping our brand partners craft thoughtful messages and create valuable experiences for Snapchatters during these difficult times. We are partnering with brands on how to best speak with the Snapchat generation and help them discover new products and services as they spend more time at home and online. We have identified many opportunities and we know that Snapchat is a destination where people will discover brands for the first time as the global health crisis changes their buying behaviors. With this understanding, our team has pivoted quickly to focusing our sales resources on categories that are best positioned in the current environment, such as gaming, home entertainment, ecommerce and consumer packaged goods, while also helping industries that have experienced outsized impacts to build long-term roadmaps to recovery. We have the opportunity to work closely with Adidas to adapt a new campaign for Snapchat in response to the growing number of stay at home orders moving through Europe. With this in mind, Adidas booked a national filter across the U.K. and Germany. They complimented this with audience filters and commercials across other markets to encourage Snapchatters to stay home and to offer them creative, fit and fun ways to stay active during this period. Our team worked quickly with Adidas to help create their hashtag home team campaign within 24 hours, with the filter being viewed more than 14 million times across the U.K. and Germany. Our large audience, creative formats and advanced measurement tools provide a significant opportunity for brands such as Adidas to reach Snapchatters during these challenging and unprecedented times. Our team has also been working to provide useful products and resources for businesses as they manage the current economic landscape. We made our self serve tools more accessible than ever have lower minimum spends and are experimenting with local ad formats such as swipe to call, which we first launched in MENA specifically for local businesses and have now expanded to the U.S. this quarter. As evidenced by our strong performance in Q1, advertisers value our large unduplicated and hard to reach audience. In the U.S., we continue to reach more than 90% of 13 to 24 year olds, and more than 75% of 13 to 34 year olds. In our more established international locales such as the U.K., France, Canada and Australia, we reached more than 80% of 13 to 24 year olds and more than 60% of 13 to 34 year olds. We're also growing rapidly in other international markets such as India, where we have recently been investing both time and resources to engage and grow our Snapchat community. Members of the Snapchat generation are the consumers of the future have significant lifetime values for our advertising partners and are in the process of building brand loyalties which makes our audience extremely attractive to advertisers. While, advertiser demand has been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we remain focused on making progress against our ARPU opportunity through our three key priorities. First, improving our ranking, optimization and measurement to drive relevance and deliver ROI. Second, building on our sales and marketing functions to support the needs of our advertising partners around the world. And third, delivering innovative ad experiences through video and augmented reality that deliver real business value. Our three priorities along with our unique reach and growing global audience, allow us to drive performance at scale for businesses around the world. We've been investing in our first priority of improving ranking, optimization and measurement since 2016, when our team made a difficult and deliberate decision to transition our ad business to an auction-based self serve platform. In the subsequent years, we invested heavily in performance oriented products and services. As a result, we have made remarkable progress with advertisers looking to drive consistent, measurable ROI, launching dozens of new features over the last two years, such as bid optimizations for conversion events like app installs, as well as advanced targeting and measurement capabilities. This has helped scale our direct response revenue in particular, which has more than doubled as a share of our total ad revenue over the last two years. Consequently, this strategy has put us in a strong position for this immediate crisis, as well as to continue to take share of the digital ad market on the road to recovery. For example, advertisers such as Plarium, creators of the mobile game Vikings: War of Clans are finding that Snapchat is a unique and powerful way for marketers to engage with millennials and Gen Z, which control over $1 trillion in direct spending power and have grown up with using their mobile phones. Noam Sagie, Director of Marketing at Plarium said \"Plarium's work with Snapchat is aimed at growing our penetration with the Gen Z and millennial audiences measured on profitability. We integrated with Snapchat's API and developed a technology for accurately reaching potential players. We heavily invested in the creative customization of our ads focused on bidding with purchase optimization. Between Q2 2019 and Q1 2020, Plarium has grown at Snapchat quarterly investment by 310%. Players coming from Snapchat are 30% better than Plarium's average in terms of seven day retention rates. Also, these players have significantly higher intent than the average player to convert from the free version of the app to paying users.\" We are finding that more and more advertisers are adopting our down funnel products such as pixel and app purchase bidding, which is continuing to drive meaningful return on ad spend for performance oriented advertisers. Revenue from pixel and app purchase objectives have doubled year-over-year and we continue to see huge opportunity with direct response advertisers as we are able to translate measurement and optimization improvements into meaningful conversions for advertisers. Our second priority is to grow demand through better service of our advertising partners. The structural improvements we have made to our sales team and sales operations over the past year have enabled us to better support our advertising partners and improve advertiser demand. This includes building teams to work with not only our largest global advertisers, but also performance oriented advertisers who are scaling their games or ecommerce businesses. We are all excited to build on this momentum with Peter Naylor as our new VP of the Americas who will join Snap in early May. Our teams are well aligned and have begun to go deep with verticals where we believe we can deliver strong performance in ROI due to the characteristics of our audience and how they use our service. One leading indicator of the success of our sales team reorganization is that we have doubled the amount of money committed via upfronts in 2020 versus 2019. This is an indication that brands and agencies have confidence in our platform and advertisers are committed to working with us in an always on way, given the return on advertising spends that they're experiencing. Our third priority is to lead the way with innovative advertising products and services. We continue to invest heavily in innovative solutions that leverage our content and augmented reality platforms in order to drive better outcomes for advertisers and delight our Snapchat community. As an example, e.l.f. cosmetics CMO, Kory Marchisotto said, \"Our business is growing and our message is clearly resonating with Snaps core Gen Z and millennial audience. In partnership with our media agency [indiscernible], we utilize Snap ads to efficiently help our consumers shop for new eye, lip, face and skincare products and implemented dynamic ads to further optimize and personalize our ads for customers. We continue to innovate and optimize across Snap ecosystem which has led to significant drops in CPAs, one of our priority performance marketing objectives.\" The continued rise of mobile content consumption, especially on mobile native premium formats presents us with a growing opportunity. Our market position as a leading platform focused on premium mobile video provides us better insights and data about what performs well on mobile devices. And over the last year, we have doubled down on our video advertising solutions with a robust rollout of products for video buyers. For example, we have been increasingly focused on our Snap Select offering for premium video ads. Snap Select allows brands to reserve our commercial video product within select discover shows at a predictable fixed price. It's designed for both social video and online video buyers and has the potential to attract incremental online video and TV budgets into our hand curated brand safe environment. As Evan mentioned, we are seeing continued success with our augmented reality platform. We believe that augmented reality is the future of computing and holds tremendous potential for experiential, immersive advertising. Our self serve AR buying tools have been scaling quickly since their launch less than two years ago, and we believe that advertisers will grow with their investment in our ad platform as we continue driving new AR ad products, market education and robust measurement. Self service is the dominant way our advertisers buy AR, which supports the investments we're making to improve lens studio and democratize the creation process. We are at the beginning of building out our AR ecosystem and providing additional value beyond paid media. For example, in response to the global health crisis, we launched our first ever fundraising AR lens which uses our skin camera search technology to drive donations from 33 countries to the World Health Organization's COVID-19 solidarity response funds. We enable the camera to recognize 23 currency notes to trigger different lenses for each currency, with each experience visually representing how your money is raised and transformed into the three pillars of the fund. A hospital to represent patient care, a mask to represent medical supplies, and beakers to represent research and development turning physical items such as dollar bills that are a part of Snapchatters everyday lives into calls to action through immersive AR is a unique way to connect with our audience and an important milestone for this technology. We entered 2020 with a full featured ad platform and a sales team structured to support our business and we pivoted quickly to support our community and partners as the COVID-19 pandemics disrupted the global economy. We will continue to invest for the long-term and making product and marketplace improvements to help advertisers scale, building focused relationships with brands and agencies across verticals, and improving our direct response products for performance-centric businesses. Based on the size of our audience, their levels of engagement across our service and our overall opportunity in the growing digital advertising market, we are well positioned to play an important role in driving the recovery of businesses across the world. With that, I'll turn the call over to Derek.\nDerek Anderson: Thanks, Jeremi. Our Q1 financial results reflect our priorities of growing our community, making focused investments in the future of our business and scaling our operations efficiently in order to drive towards profitability and positive free cash flow. As Evan mentioned earlier, our community grew to 229 million daily active users in Q1, with year-over-year growth accelerating to 20% up from 17% in the prior quarter. While we observe higher engagement in the final weeks of the quarter, as many in our community sought to stay connected and entertain from home. This has little impact on our Q1 results, as we calculate this metric using a daily average. As a result, we were already on pace to accelerate year-over-year growth in daily active users absent this impact, the accelerating growth in our community reflects the cumulative impact of improvements we have made to our application, which are contributing to higher levels of engagement and the sustained retention of new Snapchatters. The growth in our community continues to be broad-based with year-over-year growth rates accelerating on both iOS and Android platforms, as well as across each of our North America, Europe and rest of world regions. In North America, DAU grew by 10% year-over-year, compared to 9% in the prior quarter; in Europe DAU grew by 14% year-over-year, up from 12% in the prior quarter; in rest of world, DAU grew by 45% year-over-year compared to 36% in the prior quarter. We believe the accelerating growth of our community and an increasingly competitive market for attention on mobile clearly demonstrates the value of our differentiated platform. Q1 revenue was 462 million, an increase of 44% year-over-year, which is consistent with our growth rate in Q4, and just above the midpoint of our guidance range. The economic environment has become challenging for many of our advertising partners and this has had an impact on the rate of growth in our business. For example, year-over-year growth in January and February was approximately 58%, before declining to approximately 25% in March. We believe that the elevated growth rates we observed at the beginning of the quarter are a strong indication of our ability to accelerate growth under normal market conditions, and that our Q1 results in total provide additional evidence of our ability to continue to grow our share of the advertising ecosystem over the long-term. In North America, revenue grew 40% year-over-year in Q1 compared to 42% in the prior quarter. The modest deceleration in North America in revenue growth reflects the impact of the lower growth rates we observed in March. In Europe revenue 61% year-over-year in Q1 compared to 47% in Q4. We were pleased to see that year-over-year revenue growth accelerated in Europe, as this was just the second full quarter following our international sales team reorganization. And rest of world revenue grew 49% year-over-year in Q1, which was consistent with the prior quarter. All regions saw their growth rates decline in the month of March by roughly equivalent magnitudes. We continue to see strong adoption of our ad products, including our goal based bidding products, which are driving increased demand from direct response advertisers. Over the past two years, we've continued to add more objectives to our self serve platform that advertisers can use to optimize their campaigns, including app installs video views and purchases tracked by our pixel. We have also made significant improvements to our measurement capabilities and optimization models. As a result of these enhancements, direct response advertising has nearly doubled as a share of our revenue over the past two years, and represents more than half of our total revenue delivering a direct return on investment to our advertising partners ensures that we are well positioned to defend and grow our share of advertising budgets in any macro environment. Total impressions nearly doubled year-over-year in Q1, while cost per impression continued to stabilize with a year-over-year decline in eCPM of 23% in Q1, which is a modest improvement over the 24% decline observed in the prior quarter. The ongoing growth and engagement combined with optimizations to our self serve platform to utilize our inventory more efficiently are driving continued expansion of our available supply, which has placed downward pressure on eCPMs despite rapid growth in overall advertiser demand. Gross margins were 47% in Q1, up 8 percentage points year-over-year, infrastructure cost per DAU were $0.71 in Q1, down from $0.72 in the prior year, as we continue to make progress against our goal of driving down our underlying unit costs over time including the cost of deliver a Snap, the cost of deliver an impression and other key drivers of infrastructure costs. On the content side, we have been doubling down on our investments and premium content and we were pleased to see the total time spent with discover content grew by more than 35% year-over-year. Time spent with shows, which includes scripted and unscripted series, as well as daily news, shows more than doubled year-over-year in Q1 with more than 60 of our shows reaching monthly audiences of over 10 million viewers. We are particularly pleased that we have been able to make these investments in content while continuing to expand our gross margin, which reflects our overall approach of scaling our operations efficiently, while making investments in the future of our business. Operating expenses were 298 million in Q1 up 20% year-over-year. The increase in operating expenses reflects continued investment in our talent base, which has been focused on our monetization and engineering teams. We have also made investments in marketing to grow our advertiser base and Snapchatter community, which have contributed in part to robust growth in these areas. While there is typically a lag between these investments and improved output metrics, we are pleased with the results we're seeing as far. Adjusted EBITDA was negative 81 million in Q1, an improvement of 42 million over the prior year and in line with the midpoint of our guidance range. In q1, we delivered adjusted EBITDA leverage of 30% which is meaningfully positive, but down from 54% in the prior quarter. We have continued to invest in the long-term growth of our business in order to build on the momentum we have established with our community and our advertising partners, despite the near-term impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on revenue growth rates. While this has put downward pressure on adjusted EBITDA leverage in the near term, we believe it is the right decision for the long-term growth of our business, given the strength of our balance sheet and improving cash flow. Q1 marked our first quarter of positive operating cash flow at 6 million for the quarter an improvement of 72 million year-over-year driven by the improvement in adjusted EBITDA and the collection of seasonally hired Q4 advertising revenue. Free cash flow was a negative 5 million for the quarter and improvement of 73 million year-over-year. We ended the quarter with 2.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, which was roughly flat versus the prior quarter. We also have access to more than 1 billion in additional capital by our credit facility. Given the rapidly changing environment, we do not intend to share financial guidance for Q2 in the same manner that we have in recent prior quarters. But we do want to provide a sense for where we are today and how we plan to invest in our business. Thus far in Q2, we estimate year-over-year revenue growth to be 15% through April 19. And our estimated growth rate in the most recent week is 11%. Today, we have less visibility into Q2 results, because so much depends on factors beyond our control, principally, how the world continues to manage the COVID-19 crisis and if or when the world's economy begins to recover. Therefore, it is not clear at this point how growth rates may evolve as we move through the quarter. We are cautiously optimistic that trends could improve over time if conditions begin to normalize. But we are also conscious that economic conditions may not improve and some of our advertising partners could continue to face headwinds caused by the crisis. Given this, we will not be sharing revenue or adjusted EBITDA guidance for Q2. We will, however, be sharing estimates on our cost structure. And these estimates assume that daily active users will be approximately 239 million in Q2, which implies year-over-year growth of approximately 18% against a tougher comparison period that included the benefit of engagement growth related to last year's launch of the new lenses powered by deep neural networks. On the expense side, we currently expect that our combined cost of revenue and operating costs will grow year-over-year in Q2 at rates roughly equivalent to what we observed in Q1. This implies the potential for modest sequential growth and the combined expense base, which we expect would be driven by the impact of higher engagement on infrastructure costs and the impact of investments in our talent base on operating costs. Given that a small minority of our cost structure varies directly with revenue in the short-term, we do not currently expect substantial variants in these cost estimates, regardless of the ultimate revenue outcome in Q2. While there is uncertainty about near-term revenue growth rates, we remain highly optimistic about the long-term prospects for our business. We remain optimistic because we believe that there are numerous factors that position our business to perform relatively well in the current environment. One, our team has thus far managed the transition to remote working conditions seamlessly and with a high degree of productivity, such that we have been able to continue to deliver for our community and our partners. Two, we are experiencing strong community and engagement growth which provides more inventory and wider reach for our advertising partners. Three, we have built a robust ad platform where advertisers can optimize for a positive return on their advertising investments. Four, our cloud-based infrastructure has allowed us to scale seamlessly and with our incremental capital expenditure as user engagement has scaled across our platform. Five, we've put significant effort into establishing an efficient cost structure, and building the mechanisms to ensure that the investments we put into our business are highly productive Six, we have made significant progress in reducing our operating cash burn, and as a result, have just produced our first quarter of positive operating cash flow. And seven, with 2.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, and an available credit line of over 1 billion, we have the working capital necessary to stay focused on a long-term and be opportunistic in this channel environment. Thank you for joining our call today and we will now take your questions.\nOperator: That concludes the prepared remarks for today's earnings call and we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRoss Sandler: Great. Congrats guys and happy to hear everybody's safe and sound. Question on the revenue run rate that you flagged for April, it actually looks pretty solid in light of what's going on broadly in digital advertising. So can you talk about the overall 2Q pipeline? Do you think you can sustain this mid-teens growth rate? And what about your category mix, or your DR mix gives you the kind of confidence that you can see these types of growth rates when a lot of your peers are seeing far worse and negative growth? Thank you.\nDerek Andersen: Hey, Ross, it's Derek speaking. I'll take the first part of that and then probably kick it over to Jeremi for the second part. I think one of the things that's important here is that we've got a challenging and rapidly evolving environment. So, a lot depends on, how the world and our governments manage this situation going forward, and how the macro environment reacts to that. I think as you pointed out, we're really pleased that the business has continued to grow under these conditions. I think that's a very big positive for the business. We're also cautiously optimistic that as we return to some sense of normalcy that we could see the business recover. And so we're cautiously optimistic about that. But I also want to point out, there's a lot we don't know. And so because of that, I think it's difficult to predict, with great confidence exactly what trends look like going forward. But in this situation, we really wanted to make sure that we were transparent and gave folks as much insight to how things are going today as possible. And I'll turn it over to Jeremi to handle some of these mix issues.\nJeremi Gorman: Thanks for the question, Ross. And why are we well positioned, Snap at its core is a communication platform and that for our community to visually connect with their closest friends and family, something that's critically important as physical distancing remains. And while it's extremely challenging for the world to stay at home, it does accelerate the move to a digital economy where people are buying and discovering new brands. And given Snaps overall market share and share of those digital wallet, we do have a unique opportunity to increase our market share, as advertisers look for cost effective ways to advertise in this environment. To take advantage of that we've pivoted our sales teams and product teams to focus on categories that are best positioned in the current environment, such as gaming, home entertainment, ecommerce and CPG and continue to help industries that have experienced outsized impacts to build long-term roadmap to recovery with them as our partner.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rich Greenfield of LightShed Partners. Please go ahead.\nRich Greenfield: Thanks for taking the question. When you think about Discover, I guess there's no doubt that you've got a lot more users using it, you put a lot more content, the algorithm is clearly getting better in terms of the quality of the content you're showing. But with TV sort of running out of content, with productions shut down. Seems like there's a pretty big opportunity for you to take TV ad dollars and that may be difficult during the current pandemic and what's happening to ad spend. But curious, you brought on Pete Naylor, his expertise is obviously stealing or taking TV ad dollars and bring them over to Hulu. Curious, like, what's the plan with Pete Naylor? Like, what are you actually trying to do? Or should we expect a meaningful increase in the amount of content on Discover as we head into 2021? And maybe just attached to that? I mean, I guess that's partly kind of from an advertising standpoint question for Jeremi. But I'm also curious from a content creation standpoint, do you have partners that are actually struggling to create content for Discover? I mean, I saw a Good Luck America the other day was shot from Peter's house. What is the kind of the content pipeline look like? Can you keep Discover robust during the pandemic? Thanks.\nJeremi Gorman: Yes. Thanks for the question Rich. Video is absolutely a top priority for us as TV budgets migrate to digital, they typically move to places that carry some of the same advantages as traditional linear TV. And we've been investing in those things for a number of years. We are to your point investing in more curated premium Discover content, such as our lineup of Snap originals, as you know we introduced commercials, which are non-skippable for the first six seconds. And then importantly, we also have introduced new products that mirror the television format. So for instance, we now allow for longer video ads, including our standard 15 and 30 seconds, which is a complement to the six that we've had for a number of years. We bundled our curated Discover content in commercials into Snap Select, which allows brands to reserve within select Discover shows at predictable fixed prices, and we continue to invest in the team. You noted Peter Naylor and of course, with over 20 years of TV and video experience, he's just the most recent investment in the strategy. And we're thrilled to have him on board. But we've invested in both sales and product leaders from the video space for a number of years, and it remains critically important to us.\nEvan Spiegel: Hey, Rich. Thanks for the question. As it pertains to production, so far we've been really impressed by the innovative approach that our partners have taken including shows like Will From Home, which is a super cool quarantined based show from Will Smith. And our daily originals have continued production. Yes, as you noted, from home, but with really compelling content. There are some shows that are the non-daily originals and some of that production has been delayed. With our timeline today, if principal photography can resume in July, those shows will still release before the end of 2020. I think the way to think about the timing is really normal release volume through June, maybe slightly lighter release volume in July and August, and then more releases than usual in the fall. So that's really how we're thinking about production. But overall, our partners have really risen to the challenge in an incredibly impressive way. And that's driving a lot of the engagement that we're seeing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nHeath Terry: Great, thanks. Really appreciate the level of detail here. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of just how you seen the profile of your advertisers of all from mid-March through the first few weeks of April. I would imagine, there's a lot more behind that that shift from to 15 to 25, and then, 15% that we've seen. Just in terms of the verticals that they represent the mix of brand versus response. And then, particularly, how you've seen pricing and participation density in the auction evolved. And then, maybe more specifically, what you've seen in your app download business and I know you\u2019ve referenced direct response several times, curious, how much of that that direct response app download is representing. And then, within that, you've referenced a few times the goal based advertising, the return on advertising success platform that you've launched. What kind of adoption are you seeing there? And has it brought any new types of advertisers or profile of advertisers to Snap that you that you've seen before? Appreciate any level of detail that you can share there?\nJeremi Gorman: Sure. Thanks for the question Heath. Like everyone, we're hearing from advertisers that the global outbreak has dramatically shifted the way that they're thinking about marketing. Some have paused while they're rethinking their messaging and others are cutting funding to save jobs. It's a tough time for the industry. But we are very fortunate to have a well diversified business across both brand and VR, which is exactly what you mentioned. In fact, VR now accounts for over 50% of our overall revenue. And with that, always our business has been incredible for us during this time. Right now, we're focused primarily on the partner needs and helping them craft thoughtful messages and create valuable experiences. We talked a little bit about the sales teams pivoting, and they've done that. And to your point, app is one of the areas in which we are seeing this level of success. That includes apps that are about in home entertainment, apps that are about gaming, apps that are about at home fitness, and really anything that you can do, when you do not need to physically leave your home. We've seen extraordinary success there, ecommerce and down the line on the app installed features. When we look at the launch of our return on ad spend opportunities and what we've built, we've consistently innovated towards lower funnel goals like return on ad spend because it allows advertisers to see stable results and scale with confidence. Once advertisers join with us, they continue to retain and grow. And that again, has also been incredibly helpful here. In addition, it's still early but we're working with our sophisticated advertising partners to build out our return on ad spend offering, which is in beta, but it shows promising early results. And then lastly, when we look at our row as platform, it's really just one of a whole suite of features that we continue to develop for the most sophisticated performance driven advertisers in the world. Even in just the past few weeks, we've been testing new products such as worldwide targeting advertising, split testing and improvements to dynamic ads, and our sales team will continue to grow our capabilities to learn and help advertisers achieve the best ROI possible.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Levin of Pivotal Research Group. Please go ahead.\nMike Levin: Thanks for the question. And great results guys. Jeremi, if you could talk a little bit more about why you feel the direct response product is doing as well as it is, I mean, is some of this just the fact that the platform is a bit more nascent than some of your competitors, because the growth rates are fabulous. That, and obviously partners and a lot of advertisers are struggling right now. So I'd love to hear more about initiatives, aside from just the categorization focus that your team is doing so that you can be better positioned to come out on the other side of the crisis in the stronger position.\nJeremi Gorman: Yes, thanks for the question, Michael. Specifically, we have many strength of which -- the most important of which is our large growing and unduplicated audience. We've been focusing for years on improving measurement, ranking and optimization to drive the relevance and deliver ROI. We're changing and building out our sales and marketing structures to support the needs of our advertising partners and continue to create the innovative ad experiences around video and augmented reality that deliver the real business value. And I think most importantly, we are really doubling down on that unique and unduplicated audience, which gives us an inherent advantage at scale. And as we look at our app advertisers, as we talked about at home advertisers, all of this is really just an acceleration into an economy that the [snapshot] [ph] generation has been adopted - has adopted for years, which is the digital economy. So we're feeling that as a very, very strong tailwind for us right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC. Please go ahead.\nMark Mahaney: Great, thanks. Two questions. I want to ask about any learnings you've had from gaming -- games that are being played on the side that you threw out some metrics, you disclosed some metrics about seeing a surge in activity, you've had games kind of integrated into the platform for about a year. But I'm sure there's been a reason -- clearly there has been a recent surge, any learnings from that about whether that makes you more constructive on the game's outlook on Snap or things you need to do differently? And then just briefly, talk about India, and you called it out is one of the international markets that you seem to be getting some good traction. Just talk a little bit more about learnings from that market that's an unusual one, I think for Snap given its history. So just what you've learned from there and whether you think that kind of success that you may be seeing there, how replicable that is in other markets. Thanks.\nEvan Spiegel: Thanks Mark. Yes, it pertains again, really exciting to see the accelerated adoption there. I think this also validates our strategy to build games around playing with friends, because I think that's especially relevant during this period of time, people want activities to do together. And so our games platform allows people to play at the same time as they're talking and chatting and hanging out together. So, we released five new titles, we're learning a lot, title by title and rolling that back into updates and new releases. So lots of learnings going on. Of course, it's very early but we have seen acceleration given this period of time, including from folks who are discovering games for the first time and playing with their friends. So that's certainly exciting in terms of development of our games platform. As it pertains to India, it's definitely a market we're really excited about and investing a lot into. One of the things that we've seen really work well there has been really think custom and culturally relevant augmented reality experiences and increasingly more content. So we're definitely investing in evolving the product for India specifically. And one of the things we've been happy to see is that people that are have really embraced talking visually, there's this fluency with visual communication that's really exciting and that bodes well for our future growth in India.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nStephen Ju: Thanks very much. So Evan, I think you shared some specific commentary about what your users are doing on the app right now. And maybe this is a bit early, but consumer habits are changing as we speak. So, what do you think you can do to ensure that the lift that you're seeing in terms of users and engagement will continue to work in your favor? And, Jeremi, I think in the past the Olympics have been a positive catalyst for you guys. But the business has since grown pretty significantly around that type of spend. So with the Tokyo Olympics being postponed into next year, I mean, we have to think about what that budget that was earmarked is going to do so any thoughts or feedback from your partners in terms of where that budget is going to go? Thanks.\nEvan Spiegel: Hi, Steve. This is early to -- I think that's where the long-term engagement patterns will land. But what we're really paying attention to are the structural changes that you alluded to. So one of the examples here, I think, is around augmented reality. One of the things we've been really investing a lot in this transition from augmented reality being something that's entertainment based something that provides increasing utility. And we believe that that transition has been accelerated by this crisis. And I can give an example beauty companies spend a huge amount of time and money with trialing and testing their products. And we really believe that due to concerns about transmission, it's become a business imperative to evolve the testing paradigm and move that to technological platforms like augmented reality. And so I think that's one example of the structural changes we're seeing in terms of behavior. So we're really excited about what that means for augmented reality. And in general, across our platform, people are adopting more of our products using the forum. So believe that we'll provide a tailwind, it's just too early to say what that will look like.\nJeremi Gorman: Thanks. I'll take the second part of the question as it pertains to events. With the majority of our revenue being DR, we are less impacted by single events than we were a couple of years ago. Of course, we benefit from big brand new moments like the Super Bowl or Olympics or March Madness. But these events now have become more of a bonus on top of our steady self service business into which we've invested heavily by focusing on the ROI measurement and optimization that we talked about earlier. That puts us in a strong position to continue to win always on budget. Whereas experimental and event budgets are always the way to test and learn any platform, we've moved largely out of that bucket. Once advertisers try our platform, they discover meaningful ROI and strong results. This is evidenced by the doubling of our funds from 2019 to 2020. And we simply become a core part of the fabric of the media strategies for brands and agencies worldwide independent of events or experiment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBrian Nowak: Great. Thanks for taking my question guys. I've two, just the first one, maybe help us out a little bit on the type of growth you're seeing in April. How do we think about the growth in the direct response business? There seems to be really strong compared to the non-DR business in that quarter. So in the month, so what are you seeing sort of Dr non-DR in April. And then I guess the strength of DR really isn't surprising to a lot of people on this call. Maybe talk to us a little bit about how big app installs have been within that as a big driver of it. Another examples of ecommerce, we're really seeing strength in Dr? Thanks.\nEvan Spiegel: Hi, there. We can have Jeremi fill in some of the details about some aspects of this that are working really well. But what I would say is, obviously, we built this very big DR business and that's really an important driver of the growth in this moment. And if you go back a couple of quarters where we talked about last year with our growth being driven by the build of this always on business. And I think what you're seeing is that starting to pay off for the business today in terms of us having built this big DR business and become more of a core part of people's buying. And as Jeremi just mentioned, the doubling of the upfronts year-over-year really tells you that in addition to a very solid DR business, we're becoming more of a core part of folks always on business. So, Jeremi, I'll let you take over in terms of talking about this specific aspects that that are working.\nJeremi Gorman: Yes, absolutely. Thanks for the question. And as mentioned before, app install is absolutely an important part of the growth that we're seeing with a steady always on businesses because they are getting the ROI that they seek by focusing on and being able to bid on down funnel activities such as goal-based bidding for app installs or bidding for people who are completing videos, and so on and so forth. And that benefits all app install advertisers as well as all of our DR advertisers. And to be honest, in this time, advertisers are really looking for ways to make $1 go further, and we have efficient pricing. And we are a great place for advertisers to come in to get the return on ad spend that they're looking for and the same amount of impressions that they would get for that same dollar elsewhere, which is really exciting. And then in addition to that, the trends that we just see in the overall space have been really helpful for us, as we talked about with mobile outpacing desktop, video outpacing non-video and direct buying outpacing TV. All of those advertisers are seeing success on the platform very much including app install.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Please go ahead.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much, maybe two questions if I can, both follow ups. Jeremi, is it possible to get a better understanding as price per impression is dropped in March and April, as a function of sort of budget decisions by advertisers? Are you seeing new advertisers come in or new categories wanting to engage with Snapchat as a result of sort of the return on ad spend dynamic you laid out both in your script and in some of the interests tonight want to understand that dynamic a little bit better. And then Derek, how should we think about some of the investments that are being made over the short-term against your long-term profitability goals. Are the sort of pull forward of investments to take advantage of the opportunity you find yourself in? And there'll be a smoothing out of the investment certain longer duration periods, or is this sort of a new level of investment you want to call out for investors? Just want some clarity around both. Thanks so much.\nJeremi Gorman: Sure. Thanks for the question. I'll take the first part here. As I mentioned, just in my previous answer, the price per impression has dropped. But and that is allowing both our existing advertisers as well as new advertisers to see highly performing advertising and really strong ROI. So while we are seeing new advertisers come in, we are actually really focused on growing the categories on which we've doubled down during this period such as gaming, home entertainment, ecommerce and CPG. But helping our industries that have outsized impact build long-term roadmap to recovery. I think the important thing is that with so much opportunity to earn market share in any vertical or any client types, including small businesses app install, ecommerce, CPG and let's continue the upside for us for me, despite market conditions facing our partners and we'll be here for them.\nDerek Andersen: Hi, Eric. Derek Speaking. Just to go further on the investment side. I think part of the backdrop here is that we have done a tremendous amount of work over the last two years to really make the cost structure here lean. We've done a lot of work to make our infrastructure extremely efficient. As our user engagement has improved, we've been able to hold the line and the cost per DAU by driving down our unit costs. And we've had relatively modest growth and the headcount and seen us really get smart about how to deploy the capital that we have invested in the business as efficiently and productively as possible. And put a lot of mechanisms in place to make sure that we can really ensure that we're getting a big return on the investment for the cost that we are investing into the business. I think we see a lot of opportunity at the moment. And so you can see that we're continuing to hire and invest in our talent base. We've been investing in marketing, to grow our advertising community, as well as our Snapchatter community. And so I think you can expect us to continue to do that to make sure that we're investing in the long-term health of the business. We are going to be prudent though, I mean, I think that you'll see us continue to look at growth rates and how the business goes and we'll be appropriately cautious. But we do want to make sure that given the strength of our balance sheet, given all the progress we've made on the cost structure and managing our operating cash flow higher, we want to make sure that we're cautious but that we continue to invest for the long-term so that we can continue to build on and sustain the momentum that we've built with our advertisers and our communities. So I think you see that and what you've observed this quarter as well and what we've indicated for Q2. Hope that helps.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJustin Post: Great. Thank you a couple on usage. You definitely see a surge in users in March and April in the Internet space. How does that translate to DAUs in 2Q? I know you're thinking about average for the quarter in that 239. But should that help into 2Q, how are you thinking about that? And then second, maybe from Evan, no secret TikTok downloads are up a lot. But your metrics look like they're really strong. Can you talk about what metrics you look at in that category? Is it discover time spend? Is it overall users or time spent on Snap? How do you think about that on the metric side? Thank you.\nDerek Andersen: Hey, there. It's Derek speaking. Thanks for the question. Talking about users in Q2, I think one of the really important things here is all of the work that we've done to improve the app and the performance of the app in order to drive retention over time. And so, as we see these moments we're able to have growth in DAU, the ability to build on that and sustain that over time is really important. And so, a lot of work by the teams to really drive that out and make that possible over the last few years. And so, yes, I think we've put together our estimate for Q2 that our costs are based on, I think that demonstrates that. In addition, we've shared some metrics just around how user engagement on a per day basis has improved, including some of the aspects of the app that have done particularly well, it has done a really good growth on content engagement and so on. And so it's having the content and the investments we've made in the app that are driving that through and I think you can see that come through on our estimate there for Q2. I'll turn it over to Even for the for the second part of that.\nEvan Spiegel: Hi, Justin. Yes, as we look at the business, one of the things that has made our business and our community so resilient over time are the really close relationships people have with their friends on our service and the use of our service to communicate in a differentiated way. And so, we look a lot at the input metrics making sure people are finding their friends that they can start a conversation and you see that show up in things like daily active users and Snap Creation, which reached 4 billion Snaps created on average during this quarter. So, that hopefully gives you some context, but of course, we pay attention to all sorts of metrics across the business. And we're very focused on continuing to innovate and provide a great service to our community.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow up on DR, your DR comes obviously across bigger brands, and then also SMBs. So hoping you could help us overlay your SMB exposure on top of that, is it reasonable to think that SMBs are also the majority of revenue at this point, or would that not be accurate? Thanks.\nJeremi Gorman: Thanks for the question. You're right, we actually look at all of our advertisers like DR advertisers, we believe that is absolutely our responsibility to provide the best return on ad spend no matter what their goals are via video consumption, app install, big brands, list these kinds of things. As it pertains to small and medium businesses specifically, that is not the majority of our DR business. But it is a really hard time for those advertisers. Businesses are getting hit hard across the whole industry. And we can and will continue to help small businesses in any way we can. Right now that looks like helping them understand how to talk to this generation, so that when the doors open and this generation comes back into stores and is able to support them, then they have the right messages and have built the brand equity during this period of time. But as it pertains to our exposure, with so much opportunity to earn market share and our diversification across verticals, as well as segments, including big brands to SMB direct response advertisers that are more online focused, then we really have an opportunity to continue to grow despite these market conditions. We're going to execute for the best and plan for the worst, but the most important thing that we can do for small businesses during this time is just to support them and we're really pleased with our diversification so that it doesn't impact us at this time. Thank you for the question.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session as well as Snap Inc's. first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Thank you for attending today's session and you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Hey, Ross, it's Derek speaking. I'll take the first part of that and then probably kick it over to Jeremi for the second part. I think one of the things that's important here is that we've got a challenging and rapidly evolving environment. So, a lot depends on, how the world and our governments manage this situation going forward, and how the macro environment reacts to that. I think as you pointed out, we're really pleased that the business has continued to grow under these conditions. I think that's a very big positive for the business. We're also cautiously optimistic that as we return to some sense of normalcy that we could see the business recover. And so we're cautiously optimistic about that. But I also want to point out, there's a lot we don't know. And so because of that, I think it's difficult to predict, with great confidence exactly what trends look like going forward. But in this situation, we really wanted to make sure that we were transparent and gave folks as much insight to how things are going today as possible. And I'll turn it over to Jeremi to handle some of these mix issues. Hi, Eric. Derek Speaking. Just to go further on the investment side.

            "name": "Jeremi Gorman",
            "content": "Thank you, Evan. We're pleased with our results for this quarter amidst a challenging and rapidly evolving global health crisis. And we continue to see significant upside and opportunity for our business as we support our community and advertising partners through this difficult time. In Q1, we generated total revenue of $462 million, an increase of 44% year-over-year and consistent with our year-over-year growth rate in Q4 of last year. We are confident that our business is well positioned for long-term success evidenced by the high revenue growth rates we achieved in the first two months of the quarter, as well as our continued growth in the final month of Q1. The global outbreak of COVID-19 has dramatically shifted the ways brands are thinking about reaching new audiences. While friends and families are physically separated from each other in their regular routines, Snapchatters are coming together virtually to maintain their friendships through visual communication, self expression and storytelling. Our sales teams have been focused on helping our brand partners craft thoughtful messages and create valuable experiences for Snapchatters during these difficult times. We are partnering with brands on how to best speak with the Snapchat generation and help them discover new products and services as they spend more time at home and online. We have identified many opportunities and we know that Snapchat is a destination where people will discover brands for the first time as the global health crisis changes their buying behaviors. With this understanding, our team has pivoted quickly to focusing our sales resources on categories that are best positioned in the current environment, such as gaming, home entertainment, ecommerce and consumer packaged goods, while also helping industries that have experienced outsized impacts to build long-term roadmaps to recovery. We have the opportunity to work closely with Adidas to adapt a new campaign for Snapchat in response to the growing number of stay at home orders moving through Europe. With this in mind, Adidas booked a national filter across the U.K. and Germany. They complimented this with audience filters and commercials across other markets to encourage Snapchatters to stay home and to offer them creative, fit and fun ways to stay active during this period. Our team worked quickly with Adidas to help create their hashtag home team campaign within 24 hours, with the filter being viewed more than 14 million times across the U.K. and Germany. Our large audience, creative formats and advanced measurement tools provide a significant opportunity for brands such as Adidas to reach Snapchatters during these challenging and unprecedented times. Our team has also been working to provide useful products and resources for businesses as they manage the current economic landscape. We made our self serve tools more accessible than ever have lower minimum spends and are experimenting with local ad formats such as swipe to call, which we first launched in MENA specifically for local businesses and have now expanded to the U.S. this quarter. As evidenced by our strong performance in Q1, advertisers value our large unduplicated and hard to reach audience. In the U.S., we continue to reach more than 90% of 13 to 24 year olds, and more than 75% of 13 to 34 year olds. In our more established international locales such as the U.K., France, Canada and Australia, we reached more than 80% of 13 to 24 year olds and more than 60% of 13 to 34 year olds. We're also growing rapidly in other international markets such as India, where we have recently been investing both time and resources to engage and grow our Snapchat community. Members of the Snapchat generation are the consumers of the future have significant lifetime values for our advertising partners and are in the process of building brand loyalties which makes our audience extremely attractive to advertisers. While, advertiser demand has been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we remain focused on making progress against our ARPU opportunity through our three key priorities. First, improving our ranking, optimization and measurement to drive relevance and deliver ROI. Second, building on our sales and marketing functions to support the needs of our advertising partners around the world. And third, delivering innovative ad experiences through video and augmented reality that deliver real business value. Our three priorities along with our unique reach and growing global audience, allow us to drive performance at scale for businesses around the world. We've been investing in our first priority of improving ranking, optimization and measurement since 2016, when our team made a difficult and deliberate decision to transition our ad business to an auction-based self serve platform. In the subsequent years, we invested heavily in performance oriented products and services. As a result, we have made remarkable progress with advertisers looking to drive consistent, measurable ROI, launching dozens of new features over the last two years, such as bid optimizations for conversion events like app installs, as well as advanced targeting and measurement capabilities. This has helped scale our direct response revenue in particular, which has more than doubled as a share of our total ad revenue over the last two years. Consequently, this strategy has put us in a strong position for this immediate crisis, as well as to continue to take share of the digital ad market on the road to recovery. For example, advertisers such as Plarium, creators of the mobile game Vikings: War of Clans are finding that Snapchat is a unique and powerful way for marketers to engage with millennials and Gen Z, which control over $1 trillion in direct spending power and have grown up with using their mobile phones. Noam Sagie, Director of Marketing at Plarium said \"Plarium's work with Snapchat is aimed at growing our penetration with the Gen Z and millennial audiences measured on profitability. We integrated with Snapchat's API and developed a technology for accurately reaching potential players. We heavily invested in the creative customization of our ads focused on bidding with purchase optimization. Between Q2 2019 and Q1 2020, Plarium has grown at Snapchat quarterly investment by 310%. Players coming from Snapchat are 30% better than Plarium's average in terms of seven day retention rates. Also, these players have significantly higher intent than the average player to convert from the free version of the app to paying users.\" We are finding that more and more advertisers are adopting our down funnel products such as pixel and app purchase bidding, which is continuing to drive meaningful return on ad spend for performance oriented advertisers. Revenue from pixel and app purchase objectives have doubled year-over-year and we continue to see huge opportunity with direct response advertisers as we are able to translate measurement and optimization improvements into meaningful conversions for advertisers. Our second priority is to grow demand through better service of our advertising partners. The structural improvements we have made to our sales team and sales operations over the past year have enabled us to better support our advertising partners and improve advertiser demand. This includes building teams to work with not only our largest global advertisers, but also performance oriented advertisers who are scaling their games or ecommerce businesses. We are all excited to build on this momentum with Peter Naylor as our new VP of the Americas who will join Snap in early May. Our teams are well aligned and have begun to go deep with verticals where we believe we can deliver strong performance in ROI due to the characteristics of our audience and how they use our service. One leading indicator of the success of our sales team reorganization is that we have doubled the amount of money committed via upfronts in 2020 versus 2019. This is an indication that brands and agencies have confidence in our platform and advertisers are committed to working with us in an always on way, given the return on advertising spends that they're experiencing. Our third priority is to lead the way with innovative advertising products and services. We continue to invest heavily in innovative solutions that leverage our content and augmented reality platforms in order to drive better outcomes for advertisers and delight our Snapchat community. As an example, e.l.f. cosmetics CMO, Kory Marchisotto said, \"Our business is growing and our message is clearly resonating with Snaps core Gen Z and millennial audience. In partnership with our media agency [indiscernible], we utilize Snap ads to efficiently help our consumers shop for new eye, lip, face and skincare products and implemented dynamic ads to further optimize and personalize our ads for customers. We continue to innovate and optimize across Snap ecosystem which has led to significant drops in CPAs, one of our priority performance marketing objectives.\" The continued rise of mobile content consumption, especially on mobile native premium formats presents us with a growing opportunity. Our market position as a leading platform focused on premium mobile video provides us better insights and data about what performs well on mobile devices. And over the last year, we have doubled down on our video advertising solutions with a robust rollout of products for video buyers. For example, we have been increasingly focused on our Snap Select offering for premium video ads. Snap Select allows brands to reserve our commercial video product within select discover shows at a predictable fixed price. It's designed for both social video and online video buyers and has the potential to attract incremental online video and TV budgets into our hand curated brand safe environment. As Evan mentioned, we are seeing continued success with our augmented reality platform. We believe that augmented reality is the future of computing and holds tremendous potential for experiential, immersive advertising. Our self serve AR buying tools have been scaling quickly since their launch less than two years ago, and we believe that advertisers will grow with their investment in our ad platform as we continue driving new AR ad products, market education and robust measurement. Self service is the dominant way our advertisers buy AR, which supports the investments we're making to improve lens studio and democratize the creation process. We are at the beginning of building out our AR ecosystem and providing additional value beyond paid media. For example, in response to the global health crisis, we launched our first ever fundraising AR lens which uses our skin camera search technology to drive donations from 33 countries to the World Health Organization's COVID-19 solidarity response funds. We enable the camera to recognize 23 currency notes to trigger different lenses for each currency, with each experience visually representing how your money is raised and transformed into the three pillars of the fund. A hospital to represent patient care, a mask to represent medical supplies, and beakers to represent research and development turning physical items such as dollar bills that are a part of Snapchatters everyday lives into calls to action through immersive AR is a unique way to connect with our audience and an important milestone for this technology. We entered 2020 with a full featured ad platform and a sales team structured to support our business and we pivoted quickly to support our community and partners as the COVID-19 pandemics disrupted the global economy. We will continue to invest for the long-term and making product and marketplace improvements to help advertisers scale, building focused relationships with brands and agencies across verticals, and improving our direct response products for performance-centric businesses. Based on the size of our audience, their levels of engagement across our service and our overall opportunity in the growing digital advertising market, we are well positioned to play an important role in driving the recovery of businesses across the world. With that, I'll turn the call over to Derek. Thanks for the question, Ross. And why are we well positioned, Snap at its core is a communication platform and that for our community to visually connect with their closest friends and family, something that's critically important as physical distancing remains. And while it's extremely challenging for the world to stay at home, it does accelerate the move to a digital economy where people are buying and discovering new brands. And given Snaps overall market share and share of those digital wallet, we do have a unique opportunity to increase our market share, as advertisers look for cost effective ways to advertise in this environment. To take advantage of that we've pivoted our sales teams and product teams to focus on categories that are best positioned in the current environment, such as gaming, home entertainment, ecommerce and CPG and continue to help industries that have experienced outsized impacts to build long-term roadmap to recovery with them as our partner. Yes. Thanks for the question Rich. Video is absolutely a top priority for us as TV budgets migrate to digital, they typically move to places that carry some of the same advantages as traditional linear TV. And we've been investing in those things for a number of years. We are to your point investing in more curated premium Discover content, such as our lineup of Snap originals, as you know we introduced commercials, which are non-skippable for the first six seconds. And then importantly, we also have introduced new products that mirror the television format. So for instance, we now allow for longer video ads, including our standard 15 and 30 seconds, which is a complement to the six that we've had for a number of years. We bundled our curated Discover content in commercials into Snap Select, which allows brands to reserve within select Discover shows at predictable fixed prices, and we continue to invest in the team. You noted Peter Naylor and of course, with over 20 years of TV and video experience, he's just the most recent investment in the strategy. And we're thrilled to have him on board. But we've invested in both sales and product leaders from the video space for a number of years, and it remains critically important to us. Sure. Thanks for the question Heath. Like everyone, we're hearing from advertisers that the global outbreak has dramatically shifted the way that they're thinking about marketing. Some have paused while they're rethinking their messaging and others are cutting funding to save jobs. It's a tough time for the industry. But we are very fortunate to have a well diversified business across both brand and VR, which is exactly what you mentioned. In fact, VR now accounts for over 50% of our overall revenue. And with that, always our business has been incredible for us during this time. Right now, we're focused primarily on the partner needs and helping them craft thoughtful messages and create valuable experiences. We talked a little bit about the sales teams pivoting, and they've done that. And to your point, app is one of the areas in which we are seeing this level of success. That includes apps that are about in home entertainment, apps that are about gaming, apps that are about at home fitness, and really anything that you can do, when you do not need to physically leave your home. We've seen extraordinary success there, ecommerce and down the line on the app installed features. When we look at the launch of our return on ad spend opportunities and what we've built, we've consistently innovated towards lower funnel goals like return on ad spend because it allows advertisers to see stable results and scale with confidence. Once advertisers join with us, they continue to retain and grow. And that again, has also been incredibly helpful here. In addition, it's still early but we're working with our sophisticated advertising partners to build out our return on ad spend offering, which is in beta, but it shows promising early results. And then lastly, when we look at our row as platform, it's really just one of a whole suite of features that we continue to develop for the most sophisticated performance driven advertisers in the world. Even in just the past few weeks, we've been testing new products such as worldwide targeting advertising, split testing and improvements to dynamic ads, and our sales team will continue to grow our capabilities to learn and help advertisers achieve the best ROI possible. Yes, thanks for the question, Michael. Specifically, we have many strength of which -- the most important of which is our large growing and unduplicated audience. We've been focusing for years on improving measurement, ranking and optimization to drive the relevance and deliver ROI. We're changing and building out our sales and marketing structures to support the needs of our advertising partners and continue to create the innovative ad experiences around video and augmented reality that deliver the real business value. And I think most importantly, we are really doubling down on that unique and unduplicated audience, which gives us an inherent advantage at scale. And as we look at our app advertisers, as we talked about at home advertisers, all of this is really just an acceleration into an economy that the [snapshot] [ph] generation has been adopted - has adopted for years, which is the digital economy. So we're feeling that as a very, very strong tailwind for us right now. Thanks. I'll take the second part of the question as it pertains to events. With the majority of our revenue being DR, we are less impacted by single events than we were a couple of years ago. Of course, we benefit from big brand new moments like the Super Bowl or Olympics or March Madness. But these events now have become more of a bonus on top of our steady self service business into which we've invested heavily by focusing on the ROI measurement and optimization that we talked about earlier. That puts us in a strong position to continue to win always on budget. Whereas experimental and event budgets are always the way to test and learn any platform, we've moved largely out of that bucket. Once advertisers try our platform, they discover meaningful ROI and strong results. This is evidenced by the doubling of our funds from 2019 to 2020. And we simply become a core part of the fabric of the media strategies for brands and agencies worldwide independent of events or experiment. Yes, absolutely. Thanks for the question. And as mentioned before, app install is absolutely an important part of the growth that we're seeing with a steady always on businesses because they are getting the ROI that they seek by focusing on and being able to bid on down funnel activities such as goal-based bidding for app installs or bidding for people who are completing videos, and so on and so forth. And that benefits all app install advertisers as well as all of our DR advertisers. And to be honest, in this time, advertisers are really looking for ways to make $1 go further, and we have efficient pricing. And we are a great place for advertisers to come in to get the return on ad spend that they're looking for and the same amount of impressions that they would get for that same dollar elsewhere, which is really exciting. And then in addition to that, the trends that we just see in the overall space have been really helpful for us, as we talked about with mobile outpacing desktop, video outpacing non-video and direct buying outpacing TV. All of those advertisers are seeing success on the platform very much including app install. Sure. Thanks for the question. I'll take the first part here. As I mentioned, just in my previous answer, the price per impression has dropped. But and that is allowing both our existing advertisers as well as new advertisers to see highly performing advertising and really strong ROI. So while we are seeing new advertisers come in, we are actually really focused on growing the categories on which we've doubled down during this period such as gaming, home entertainment, ecommerce and CPG. But helping our industries that have outsized impact build long-term roadmap to recovery. I think the important thing is that with so much opportunity to earn market share in any vertical or any client types, including small businesses app install, ecommerce, CPG and let's continue the upside for us for me, despite market conditions facing our partners and we'll be here for them. Thanks for the question. You're right, we actually look at all of our advertisers like DR advertisers, we believe that is absolutely our responsibility to provide the best return on ad spend no matter what their goals are via video consumption, app install, big brands, list these kinds of things. As it pertains to small and medium businesses specifically, that is not the majority of our DR business. But it is a really hard time for those advertisers. Businesses are getting hit hard across the whole industry. And we can and will continue to help small businesses in any way we can. Right now that looks like helping them understand how to talk to this generation, so that when the doors open and this generation comes back into stores and is able to support them, then they have the right messages and have built the brand equity during this period of time. But as it pertains to our exposure, with so much opportunity to earn market share and our diversification across verticals, as well as segments, including big brands to SMB direct response advertisers that are more online focused, then we really have an opportunity to continue to grow despite these market conditions. We're going to execute for the best and plan for the worst, but the most important thing that we can do for small businesses during this time is just to support them and we're really pleased with our diversification so that it doesn't impact us at this time. Thank you for the question."

            "name": "Evan Spiegel",
            "content": "Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. It's been a very difficult few months for the world, but we remain hopeful and optimistic about the future. As a team, we have been focused on doing our part to help as we all navigate this unimaginable tragedy. We are inspired that people are working together and staying home to save lives and it gives us added faith in humanity to see how deeply we all care about supporting one another during this time. The shared compassion we've all demonstrated towards one another during this crisis gives us confidence that we will all be able to find the right path forward towards a safe, healthy and positive future. At Snap, our first priority is the health and safety of our community, our partners and our team. We closed our first office in January and continued to close offices as COVID-19 spread around the globe. Our team has rallied around maintaining business continuity during this critical time and I'm in awe of how quickly our team adapted to this circumstances and continue to execute against our ongoing opportunities. We are monitoring the current situation daily and are working towards a best case scenario for a rapid recovery, while also preparing for a worst case scenario. Our team remains inspired and motivated despite the challenging circumstances because our product has never been more important in people's lives especially for helping close friends and family stay together emotionally, while they are separated physically. We are seeing sustained communication volumes on our service that eclipse the peaks we see during major holidays. For example, communication with friends increased by over 30% in the last week of March compared to the last week of January with more than 50% increase in some of our larger markets. Snapchat has always been focused on helping people build and maintain their friendships which is especially critical as people practice physical distancing and shelter in their homes. We are working hard to provide our community with factual and up-to-date information as well as resources for their safety and mental health. In the early days of the crisis, we immediately launched multiple filters and lenses featuring safety tips and best practices which quickly reached hundreds of millions of people around the world. We added a new feature called Here For You that provides proactive in app support to Snapchatters who may be experiencing a mental health or emotional crisis, or who may be curious to learn more about these issues and how they can help their friends. We have also published over 700 Discover editions featuring up to the minute coverage on COVID-19 from our content partners, our in-house news teams and agencies like the CDC and WHO, with more than half of the United States Gen Z population watching news content on Discover, we feel it is particularly important for us to educate our audience with curated and trustworthy information during these critical times. We're also trying to help maintain positivity and help our community have fun together during this stressful time. We adapted our annual Snap Map icon to encourage playing from home with friends rather than going out into the world. We have seen a sharp increase in group related activities across chat, calling and games. We launched five new games this quarter and saw average daily time spend in games more than double in the month of March. In addition to news and information Discover now includes programming that celebrates the doctors, teachers, store employees and others in our community who are sharing their experiences from the frontlines. This includes uplifting content like Will From Home, in which Will Smith shares his own shelter in place experience, along with his friends, which garnered over 15 million viewers in its first three episodes. Our community has been incredibly engaged on Snapchat during this period across all of these areas, and average time spent is up over 20% in the last week of March, compared to the last week of January, with some larger markets like France and the U.K. seeing more than a 30% increase. Additionally, as people turn to video conferencing and live streaming to work and hang out together, we've seen more than 30x increase in the daily downloads of Snap Camera, a desktop app which allows people to add our suite of lenses to whichever video conferencing service they use. While supporting our community and partners during the COVID-19 health crisis has been our top priority over the past few months we remain focused on building on the momentum we've established in the growth of our community. Our community grew by 11 million daily active users to an average of 229 million daily active users during Q1, up 5% quarter-over-quarter and 20% year-over-year. Our community is using Snapchat to express themselves and communicate visually creating over 4 billion snaps with our camera every day on average. In addition to the increased usage of our camera, people are spending more and more time on Discover. Our editorial selectivity and curated approach has helped us bring best-in-class mobile content to our community that is accurate, timely and topical. We're continuing to use engagement insights and data to drive our investments in Discover by regularly adding new channels to serve the very needs and tastes of our audience, including 91 new channels around the world this quarter. This has allowed us to take a targeted approach to growing time spent on Discover amongst various demographics and geographies. For example, total daily time spent by snapchatters over the age of 35 watching Discover content doubled year-over-year in Q1 2020. This ongoing investment in the expansion and diversification of our content offerings including favorites, like Comedy Central, The Daily Show with Trevor Noah, and original content like Nikita Unfiltered, a new docuseries has helped deepen engagement on our Discover platform. Augmented reality is continuing to play an important role in the lives of Snapchatters, with people now playing with lenses 85% more each day than they did last year. A lot of this behavior is driven by our growing community of lens creators using lens studio with lenses created by our community reaching 40% of our daily active users every day on average. We've also built new immersive lenses powered by machine learning to transform the ground into lava or water. We believe that the recent acceleration in the adoption of communication technology and augmented reality during these travel restrictions will help support our longer term trends and engagement growth. We generated $462 million of revenue in Q1, representing a 44% year-over-year growth rate. While many advertising budgets declined due to COVID-19, we experienced high revenue growth rates in the first two months of the quarter, which offset our lower growth in March. These high growth rates in the beginning of the quarter reflect our investments in our audience, ad products and optimization and give us confidence in our ability to grow revenue over the long-term. We are seeing some bright spots amongst direct response advertisers, especially those who provide activities or products that our community can enjoy at home. In the short-term, we are shifting sales resources and pulling forward some investments in direct response to better serve the advertisers who are trying to reach our audience during this time. For example, we can help movie studios pivot to digital releases by supporting them with a suite of products designed to track titles over a dynamic and flexible release window. We've also seen many large brands doing a lot of important things to help their community and the broader world and we are helping these brands communicate their efforts to our audience, in a thoughtful and approachable way that inspires others to make a positive impact. In the medium-term, we are helping our partners plan for the road to recovery, which we believe will be led in part by the younger generation. As people are sheltering in their homes, they're increasingly turning to digital behaviors across every aspect of their lives, including communication, commerce, entertainment, fitness and learning. We believe that this will accelerate the digital transformation across many businesses and that the heightened levels of activity we are seeing today will lead to a sustained uplift in the digital economy over time. The Snapchat generation is digitally native and adopts new technologies quickly, which will help them continue to drive this transformation. This makes our audience uniquely positioned to help businesses recover. And we want to do our part to help jumpstart the recovery. While it is difficult to predict the near-term impact of this unprecedented complex and global pandemic on our business, we believe that all of the long-term indicators we see in terms of our audience, their engagement, our momentum on product innovation, our auction dynamics and advertiser ROI, position us very well for success. Our deep investments in direct response advertising over the past few years, including advanced bidding and campaign management tools, ad formats designed specifically for mobile apps and ecommerce and backend performance optimization have positioned us well in this uncertain environment. Our strong cash position allows us to continue to hire and make long-term investments in innovation during this time, while simultaneously prioritizing the health and safety of our community, team and partners. We're beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel in terms of the immediate health crisis, with the curve flattening in many cities and countries. The next chapter will be figuring out what the new normal will look like, both from a logistical perspective, as well as in regard to the physical and mental well being of our team. The third chapter will be the recovery, which we expect may be very fast for some businesses and much slower for others. And we are committed to helping our partners as we navigate this uncertain journey together. The many difficult transitions and changes we made as a business over the past few years have positioned us well for the challenges ahead. We have strong resilient leadership, a growing community that deeply values the service we provide an efficient advertising platform that delivers value for our advertising partners and a relentless pace of innovation, driven by the creativity and operational excellence of our team. I'm so proud of and inspired by our team and the way they have risen to this challenge, while putting the health and safety of our community first. Thanks again for joining the call and with that I will turn it over to Jeremi to share more about our business. Hey, Rich. Thanks for the question. As it pertains to production, so far we've been really impressed by the innovative approach that our partners have taken including shows like Will From Home, which is a super cool quarantined based show from Will Smith. And our daily originals have continued production. Yes, as you noted, from home, but with really compelling content. There are some shows that are the non-daily originals and some of that production has been delayed. With our timeline today, if principal photography can resume in July, those shows will still release before the end of 2020. I think the way to think about the timing is really normal release volume through June, maybe slightly lighter release volume in July and August, and then more releases than usual in the fall. So that's really how we're thinking about production. But overall, our partners have really risen to the challenge in an incredibly impressive way. And that's driving a lot of the engagement that we're seeing. Thanks Mark. Yes, it pertains again, really exciting to see the accelerated adoption there. I think this also validates our strategy to build games around playing with friends, because I think that's especially relevant during this period of time, people want activities to do together. And so our games platform allows people to play at the same time as they're talking and chatting and hanging out together. So, we released five new titles, we're learning a lot, title by title and rolling that back into updates and new releases. So lots of learnings going on. Of course, it's very early but we have seen acceleration given this period of time, including from folks who are discovering games for the first time and playing with their friends. So that's certainly exciting in terms of development of our games platform. As it pertains to India, it's definitely a market we're really excited about and investing a lot into. One of the things that we've seen really work well there has been really think custom and culturally relevant augmented reality experiences and increasingly more content. So we're definitely investing in evolving the product for India specifically. And one of the things we've been happy to see is that people that are have really embraced talking visually, there's this fluency with visual communication that's really exciting and that bodes well for our future growth in India. Hi, Steve. This is early to -- I think that's where the long-term engagement patterns will land. But what we're really paying attention to are the structural changes that you alluded to. So one of the examples here, I think, is around augmented reality. One of the things we've been really investing a lot in this transition from augmented reality being something that's entertainment based something that provides increasing utility. And we believe that that transition has been accelerated by this crisis. And I can give an example beauty companies spend a huge amount of time and money with trialing and testing their products. And we really believe that due to concerns about transmission, it's become a business imperative to evolve the testing paradigm and move that to technological platforms like augmented reality. And so I think that's one example of the structural changes we're seeing in terms of behavior. So we're really excited about what that means for augmented reality. And in general, across our platform, people are adopting more of our products using the forum. So believe that we'll provide a tailwind, it's just too early to say what that will look like. Hi, there. We can have Jeremi fill in some of the details about some aspects of this that are working really well. But what I would say is, obviously, we built this very big DR business and that's really an important driver of the growth in this moment. And if you go back a couple of quarters where we talked about last year with our growth being driven by the build of this always on business. And I think what you're seeing is that starting to pay off for the business today in terms of us having built this big DR business and become more of a core part of people's buying. And as Jeremi just mentioned, the doubling of the upfronts year-over-year really tells you that in addition to a very solid DR business, we're becoming more of a core part of folks always on business. So, Jeremi, I'll let you take over in terms of talking about this specific aspects that that are working. Hi, Justin. Yes, as we look at the business, one of the things that has made our business and our community so resilient over time are the really close relationships people have with their friends on our service and the use of our service to communicate in a differentiated way. And so, we look a lot at the input metrics making sure people are finding their friends that they can start a conversation and you see that show up in things like daily active users and Snap Creation, which reached 4 billion Snaps created on average during this quarter. So, that hopefully gives you some context, but of course, we pay attention to all sorts of metrics across the business. And we're very focused on continuing to innovate and provide a great service to our community."

            "name": "Derek Anderson",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeremi. Our Q1 financial results reflect our priorities of growing our community, making focused investments in the future of our business and scaling our operations efficiently in order to drive towards profitability and positive free cash flow. As Evan mentioned earlier, our community grew to 229 million daily active users in Q1, with year-over-year growth accelerating to 20% up from 17% in the prior quarter. While we observe higher engagement in the final weeks of the quarter, as many in our community sought to stay connected and entertain from home. This has little impact on our Q1 results, as we calculate this metric using a daily average. As a result, we were already on pace to accelerate year-over-year growth in daily active users absent this impact, the accelerating growth in our community reflects the cumulative impact of improvements we have made to our application, which are contributing to higher levels of engagement and the sustained retention of new Snapchatters. The growth in our community continues to be broad-based with year-over-year growth rates accelerating on both iOS and Android platforms, as well as across each of our North America, Europe and rest of world regions. In North America, DAU grew by 10% year-over-year, compared to 9% in the prior quarter; in Europe DAU grew by 14% year-over-year, up from 12% in the prior quarter; in rest of world, DAU grew by 45% year-over-year compared to 36% in the prior quarter. We believe the accelerating growth of our community and an increasingly competitive market for attention on mobile clearly demonstrates the value of our differentiated platform. Q1 revenue was 462 million, an increase of 44% year-over-year, which is consistent with our growth rate in Q4, and just above the midpoint of our guidance range. The economic environment has become challenging for many of our advertising partners and this has had an impact on the rate of growth in our business. For example, year-over-year growth in January and February was approximately 58%, before declining to approximately 25% in March. We believe that the elevated growth rates we observed at the beginning of the quarter are a strong indication of our ability to accelerate growth under normal market conditions, and that our Q1 results in total provide additional evidence of our ability to continue to grow our share of the advertising ecosystem over the long-term. In North America, revenue grew 40% year-over-year in Q1 compared to 42% in the prior quarter. The modest deceleration in North America in revenue growth reflects the impact of the lower growth rates we observed in March. In Europe revenue 61% year-over-year in Q1 compared to 47% in Q4. We were pleased to see that year-over-year revenue growth accelerated in Europe, as this was just the second full quarter following our international sales team reorganization. And rest of world revenue grew 49% year-over-year in Q1, which was consistent with the prior quarter. All regions saw their growth rates decline in the month of March by roughly equivalent magnitudes. We continue to see strong adoption of our ad products, including our goal based bidding products, which are driving increased demand from direct response advertisers. Over the past two years, we've continued to add more objectives to our self serve platform that advertisers can use to optimize their campaigns, including app installs video views and purchases tracked by our pixel. We have also made significant improvements to our measurement capabilities and optimization models. As a result of these enhancements, direct response advertising has nearly doubled as a share of our revenue over the past two years, and represents more than half of our total revenue delivering a direct return on investment to our advertising partners ensures that we are well positioned to defend and grow our share of advertising budgets in any macro environment. Total impressions nearly doubled year-over-year in Q1, while cost per impression continued to stabilize with a year-over-year decline in eCPM of 23% in Q1, which is a modest improvement over the 24% decline observed in the prior quarter. The ongoing growth and engagement combined with optimizations to our self serve platform to utilize our inventory more efficiently are driving continued expansion of our available supply, which has placed downward pressure on eCPMs despite rapid growth in overall advertiser demand. Gross margins were 47% in Q1, up 8 percentage points year-over-year, infrastructure cost per DAU were $0.71 in Q1, down from $0.72 in the prior year, as we continue to make progress against our goal of driving down our underlying unit costs over time including the cost of deliver a Snap, the cost of deliver an impression and other key drivers of infrastructure costs. On the content side, we have been doubling down on our investments and premium content and we were pleased to see the total time spent with discover content grew by more than 35% year-over-year. Time spent with shows, which includes scripted and unscripted series, as well as daily news, shows more than doubled year-over-year in Q1 with more than 60 of our shows reaching monthly audiences of over 10 million viewers. We are particularly pleased that we have been able to make these investments in content while continuing to expand our gross margin, which reflects our overall approach of scaling our operations efficiently, while making investments in the future of our business. Operating expenses were 298 million in Q1 up 20% year-over-year. The increase in operating expenses reflects continued investment in our talent base, which has been focused on our monetization and engineering teams. We have also made investments in marketing to grow our advertiser base and Snapchatter community, which have contributed in part to robust growth in these areas. While there is typically a lag between these investments and improved output metrics, we are pleased with the results we're seeing as far. Adjusted EBITDA was negative 81 million in Q1, an improvement of 42 million over the prior year and in line with the midpoint of our guidance range. In q1, we delivered adjusted EBITDA leverage of 30% which is meaningfully positive, but down from 54% in the prior quarter. We have continued to invest in the long-term growth of our business in order to build on the momentum we have established with our community and our advertising partners, despite the near-term impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on revenue growth rates. While this has put downward pressure on adjusted EBITDA leverage in the near term, we believe it is the right decision for the long-term growth of our business, given the strength of our balance sheet and improving cash flow. Q1 marked our first quarter of positive operating cash flow at 6 million for the quarter an improvement of 72 million year-over-year driven by the improvement in adjusted EBITDA and the collection of seasonally hired Q4 advertising revenue. Free cash flow was a negative 5 million for the quarter and improvement of 73 million year-over-year. We ended the quarter with 2.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, which was roughly flat versus the prior quarter. We also have access to more than 1 billion in additional capital by our credit facility. Given the rapidly changing environment, we do not intend to share financial guidance for Q2 in the same manner that we have in recent prior quarters. But we do want to provide a sense for where we are today and how we plan to invest in our business. Thus far in Q2, we estimate year-over-year revenue growth to be 15% through April 19. And our estimated growth rate in the most recent week is 11%. Today, we have less visibility into Q2 results, because so much depends on factors beyond our control, principally, how the world continues to manage the COVID-19 crisis and if or when the world's economy begins to recover. Therefore, it is not clear at this point how growth rates may evolve as we move through the quarter. We are cautiously optimistic that trends could improve over time if conditions begin to normalize. But we are also conscious that economic conditions may not improve and some of our advertising partners could continue to face headwinds caused by the crisis. Given this, we will not be sharing revenue or adjusted EBITDA guidance for Q2. We will, however, be sharing estimates on our cost structure. And these estimates assume that daily active users will be approximately 239 million in Q2, which implies year-over-year growth of approximately 18% against a tougher comparison period that included the benefit of engagement growth related to last year's launch of the new lenses powered by deep neural networks. On the expense side, we currently expect that our combined cost of revenue and operating costs will grow year-over-year in Q2 at rates roughly equivalent to what we observed in Q1. This implies the potential for modest sequential growth and the combined expense base, which we expect would be driven by the impact of higher engagement on infrastructure costs and the impact of investments in our talent base on operating costs. Given that a small minority of our cost structure varies directly with revenue in the short-term, we do not currently expect substantial variants in these cost estimates, regardless of the ultimate revenue outcome in Q2. While there is uncertainty about near-term revenue growth rates, we remain highly optimistic about the long-term prospects for our business. We remain optimistic because we believe that there are numerous factors that position our business to perform relatively well in the current environment. One, our team has thus far managed the transition to remote working conditions seamlessly and with a high degree of productivity, such that we have been able to continue to deliver for our community and our partners. Two, we are experiencing strong community and engagement growth which provides more inventory and wider reach for our advertising partners. Three, we have built a robust ad platform where advertisers can optimize for a positive return on their advertising investments. Four, our cloud-based infrastructure has allowed us to scale seamlessly and with our incremental capital expenditure as user engagement has scaled across our platform. Five, we've put significant effort into establishing an efficient cost structure, and building the mechanisms to ensure that the investments we put into our business are highly productive Six, we have made significant progress in reducing our operating cash burn, and as a result, have just produced our first quarter of positive operating cash flow. And seven, with 2.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, and an available credit line of over 1 billion, we have the working capital necessary to stay focused on a long-term and be opportunistic in this channel environment. Thank you for joining our call today and we will now take your questions."

We grew our community, expanded our product offerings and demonstrated the power of our augmented reality platform, both inside and outside of the Snapchat application. We faced some fresh challenges in 2021, but posted strong results, reflecting substantial progress on our journey to sustainable growth and positive cash flow generation. We grew revenue 64% year-over-year in 2021, including 42% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. We achieved adjusted EBITDA profitability for the second consecutive year. We recorded our first full-year of positive free cash flow and Q4 marked our first quarter of positive net income. Achieving positive free cash flow for the full year is an important milestone as increasingly able to self-fund our investments in the future, which positions us well to accelerate our vision for computing overlaid on the world through augmented reality. In Q4, our community grew by 20% year-over-year to 319 million daily active users. We grew sequentially in each of our three regions. While North America and Europe represent our largest monetization opportunities in the near and medium term, Rest of World represents our largest community growth opportunity. We have made a concerted effort over the past year to organize our team and make investments in our products to realize these monetization and community growth opportunities. Our expansion efforts in India continue to prove successful, and we are using our learnings to inform how we approach community growth in new geographies. Our desire to build a better way of communicating visually through our camera has evolved into a leading platform for augmented reality. Our AR products and services are driving major impact at scale today as Snapchatters use our services to shop, play, learn, explore and entertain themselves. Over 200 million people engage with augmented reality on Snapchat every day, and our community now plays with AR Lenses an average of more than six billion times per day. This momentum and the creative energy of the Snapchat community makes us incredibly excited about the future of augmented reality. At our Lens Fest AR developer event in December, we gave an update on the strength and diversity of our AR developer community, which continues to grow. There are now over 250,000 lens creators from more than 200 countries and territories who use one studio to build AR experiences. They have made more than 2.5 million lenses that have been viewed by Snapchatters now more than 3.5 trillion times and over 300 creators have each reached more than one billion views of their lenses as Snapchatters explore new AR experiences to enhance what they see and do in their daily life, we will continue to develop tools to empower Lens creators to push the boundaries of what is possible through the Snapchat camera. At Lense Fest, we also shared the ways that we are supporting creators and evolving the tools they use to build for our platform. We introduced a lens call to action feature that lets creators include a link within a lens, making it easy to drive Snapchatters to a new destination like a shop from within the AR experience. We have made a catalog of licensed music and audio clips available to integrate into lenses so that creators can build more immersive experiences. We rolled out our gifting feature, which lets Snapchatters directly support Lens creators through story replies and announced Ghost, our AR innovation lab, providing grants of up to $150,000 and Snap team support for creative AR projects. In addition to the momentum with augmented reality on Snapchat, we are very excited by the growing demand from businesses who want to bring Snap\u2019s AR capabilities into their own apps and websites. We are meeting this growing demand through Camera Kit, which enables partners to easily integrate our AR technology and create our ecosystem in ways that meet their business objectives. With their Camera Kit integration, Dress X invites users to try on and wear digital fashion in real time, supporting unique experiences that combine the physical and digital realms. Dress X has seen incredible success and engagement as 75% of their total app users engage with AR Lenses and users try on AR looks 22 times per day on average. By extending the reach of their AR lenses onto the Dress ex public profile within Snapchat, Dressx drove a 120% increase in their public profile subscriptions. This quarter, we made significant progress with our Spectacles AR glasses, the fourth generation of a product line that we first introduced more than five-years ago as a fun hands-free camera designed to help capture your perspective while staying in a moment. Hundreds of creators from 30 countries have now developed AR lenses for Spectacles, overlaying computing on the world in an immersive and interactive way. We have continued to make software improvements and offer new capabilities for developers including Connected Lenses, which link multiple Spectacles users to participate in the same AR experience together and location triggers, which lets creators customize lenses to adapt as they visit specific locations. Our content business comprises two of the five main screens of our application, Stories and Spotlight. Despite substantial competitive pressure over the years, stories remain our largest driver of revenue. It is a platform where Snapchatters share snaps with their friends in narrative form via friend stories and watch content from professional publishers and influencers in Discover. Spotlight, our newest platform, services the most entertaining snaps from our community. And we have been overwhelmed by the positive response from viewers and increasingly, creators. On our Discover platform, our content partners continue to find success. In Q4 2021, 25 different Discover partners each reached over 50 million unique Snapchatters globally. This captures a wide range of genres from Universal Music\u2019s Rebel Labs to social publisher Jungle creations lifestyle content, team whistle sports content and creator-driven shows from Jelly Smack. We are also introducing more locally relevant partners worldwide. We added more than 160 new channels in the quarter from Discover partners outside of the U.S. and onboarded new partners, including 71 Entertainment Group in Germany, and Canal+ in France. We are also investing in content from underrepresented voices through the 523 content accelerator program we launched in Q4 to support and promote small minority-owned content companies that lack access and resources relative to their larger competitors. Snap Originals are another successful element of our strategy to reflect the diversity of our community through our content. In 2021, over 50% of Snap Originals featured diverse leads or hosts. We rolled out successful new shows, including the Me and You show, which stars Snapchatters and their friends using our cameos feature and reached over 50 million viewers in Q4. In Q4 2021, the number of content viewers on Snapchat continued to grow at a significantly faster rate year-over-year than overall time spent watching content as the decline in time spent watching stories created by friends was offset by growth in time spent watching premium content in Discover as well as content in Spotlight. This is a continuation of the trend we have observed throughout the pandemic and friend story posting and viewing for daily active user have not returned to pre-pandemic levels. While we are hopeful our community will, in time, return to the friend story behaviors that we observed prior to the pandemic, we are focused on innovating on our content offerings to better serve our community today. With so many different types of content on Snapchat from friends, creators and media companies, we want to make it easier for Snapchatters to find what they want to watch when they want to watch it. We are optimistic about the results we are seeing from early experiments and look forward to rolling out more product changes this year. We also continue to make progress building out Spotlight. We have learned a lot from our creator community that will drive the evolution of the overall Snapchat content experience, including the relationship between Spotlight and Discover. Already more than 20 Spotlight creators are syndicating shows on Discover. This supports our vision of Spotlight as a platform where audiences can discover new creators, topics and communities and then engage with them more deeply on Discover. We have also been able to effectively utilize creator incentives to grow and diversify Spotlight content. In its first year, we rewarded more than 12,000 creators through a variety of programs. More recently, we have shifted our incentives to reward a broader range of content across categories and geographies. We are focused on supporting a diversity of platform-native content creation in order to build robust, sustainable content supply. In Q4, we prioritized helping creators reach new audiences, and we saw the number of Spotlight viewers subscribing to creators more than double versus the prior quarter. These efforts have also improved the viewer experience, but the number of Snapchatters favoring Spotlight snaps increasing by 20% sequentially. Since launch, we have seen our creator community grow dramatically in scale and we have been particularly encouraged by how creators are investing in the platform. Today, we see three times as many monthly posts for Creator than we did when Spotlight launched a year-ago. We created spotlight to amplify the best of Snapchat and today over 65% of spotlight submissions used one of Snapchat\u2019s AR Lenses or creative tools. We are adding utility in other areas of Snapchat as well. We have made our map even more personal by launching our first two layers, Memories and Explore, which allow users to view their safe snaps by location and explore new snaps submitted around the world. These layers have been used over 100 million times since launch. We also continue to build engagement by making places easy to discover, favorite and share with friends. Within our communications platform, we continue to add new games and minis to further promote shared experiences with friends and add additional utility for our community. Developers are finding opportunity and success with games on Snapchat. For example, we signed a deal with partner Woodoo Games to build at least 20 games for Snapchat in 2022 on the heels of five new games built in 2021. Another partner, Mojiworks, released their second hit game, Trivia party following their hit Ready Chef Go. Mojiworks has now reached nearly 100 million players across the two games. We have rolled out new use cases for minis with partners ranging from startups to established brands finding success on our platform. For example, after a successful greetings card mini Givingli recently launched a gift card e-commerce mini that enables Snapchatters to buy branded gift cards such as Sephora, DoorDash or Taco Bell and easily gift them to their friends on Snapchat. Given the enormity of the opportunity in front of us, both in terms of the Snapchat application as well as our augmented reality platform, 2022 will be a significant investment year for us as we work to accelerate our road map and deliver against our long-term vision of computing overlaid on the world. We will continue to remain focused on doing the right things to promote the safety and well-being of our community, investing in new technologies and teams to protect Snapchatters and ensure they have a positive experience with our products. The trust of our community is essential to us, and we don\u2019t take it for granted. We work every day to improve, and we are always learning how we can better support our community. I will now turn it over to Jeremi to discuss more about our business.\nJeremi Gorman: Thanks, Evan. In 2021, we delivered strong results amidst several challenges to our industry and demonstrated the resilience of our team and our business while investing in the future of our platform. We generated 4.1 billion in full-year revenue, an increase of 64% year-over-year, which is an acceleration of 18 percentage points over 2020. In Q4, we generated total revenue of 1.3 billion, an increase of 42% year-over-year amidst headwinds to both our direct response and brand businesses. On the direct response side, we continue to work through challenges presented by Apple\u2019s ATT related changes, and we are making solid progress. As anticipated, on the brand side, macro headwinds related to supply chain disruptions and labor disruptions materialized and remain unresolved in the new year. Despite all of this, we continue to onboard new advertisers which drove our active advertiser count to another all-time high. We remain focused on our many opportunities to support our community and advertising partners, which we believe will be driven by three key priorities. First, driving ROI through optimization and measurement; second, investing in our sales and marketing functions by continuing to train, hire and build for scale; third, building innovative ad experiences around video and augmented reality. Our unwavering commitment to these three priorities, along with our unique reach and growing global audience, allows us to drive performance at scale for businesses around the world. Our sales team is working hard to help advertisers adapt to the new measurement paradigms brought about by Apple\u2019s iOS privacy-related changes. Our advertising partners who prefer to leverage lower-funnel goals such as in-app purchases, have been most impacted by these changes. We are seeing these advertisers migrate to mid-funnel goals where they have greater visibility such as install or click. Advertisers who optimize via web-based goal-based bids or GBBs have been less impacted, given that many of them have adopted the snack pixel. Many of our advertisers have enabled both Apple\u2019s SK Ad Network or Scan as well as our own first-party measurement solutions, which we broadly refer to as Advanced Conversion, or AC. While Scan has benefits and its ability to report DDuped results across multiple platforms, AC offers our performance advertisers much more flexibility and more advanced features. We continue to improve Advanced Conversions with features such as estimated conversions, which augments observed conversion data with real-time data to help in better decision-making. Ultimately, first-party integrations allow us to build out measurement solutions based on advertiser input and directly connect to how our formats and targeting work so that businesses have the most accurate view of ROI. These allow us to preserve the privacy of our community while helping advertisers weather the disruption from platform changes. We believe it will take time to achieve broad enablement, utilization and full confidence in these measurement solutions among our advertiser base. However, we are pleased with the early progress we have made with many advertisers thus far as these new solutions are now enabled for advertisers that represent more than 75% of our direct response revenue. Right now, we are focused on helping advertisers gain confidence in these new solutions. This includes helping them perform list studies, which can take multiple weeks or more, depending on the scale of an advertiser\u2019s campaign. As mobile ad measurement moves to more holistic cross-platform views, we are seeing positive results with solutions, including media mix modeling and multi-touch attribution performed by advertisers in-house or through the wide range of measurement partners with which we are integrated. Our Direct Response business continues to account for the majority of our revenue. This positions us well for the long-term as we believe that driving measurable performance and ROI makes Snapchat an essential part of the growth strategies of businesses worldwide. Over time, we have seen strong results when advertisers test with us gained confidence in our ability to demonstrate meaningful return on ad spend, move us into their always on budget and expand our share over time. Over the years, we have partnered with Hollister to help them leverage many of our ad formats, such as Snap Ads, Lenses and Commercials, which have all proven to be effective at driving strong business results. This quarter, Hollister went a step further and began testing dynamic ads to drive conversions during the holiday period. They initially saw strong return on ad spend. And with the introduction of our new multi-format delivery solution, we were able to double Hollister\u2019s return on ad spend, while simultaneously bringing down overall CPM. Advertisers seeking to drive web-based conversions have remained relatively resilient through ATT as many had already implemented our Snap Pixel and built confidence in our first-party measurement solutions. As an example, this quarter, e-commerce fashion company, Pangaea, leveraged our pixel purchase optimization via Snacks, Story Ads and Dynamic Ads, which resulted in a 5x return on ad spend and was above their 2x target. We continue to invest in our sales and sales support teams to better service our advertising partners globally. Three years ago, in North America, we moved away from a regional sales structure and verticalized our sales team which allowed us to become hyper focused on the specific support advertisers needed in different industries. While we have been undergoing the same transformation globally due to smaller team sizes outside of North America, we have been slower to verticalize and international teams have worked without the levels of surrounding support we provided our sales team in North America. In 2021, we made substantial investments in over 10 markets outside of North America that represent a combined digital ad market of over $270 billion. At its core are three investment principles: first, we are investing in markets where Snapchat reaches more than 70% of 30 to 34-year-olds and they are a large and established digital ad markets. These are the markets where we see an opportunity to grow our share of budgets internationally over time. Second, the incremental resources will improve local and regional decision-making authority. The faster we are able to make decisions, the better we can service our advertising customers and the faster we can grow our business. Lastly, we have seen that when a region has a full stack of cross-functional resourcing, including functions like business marketing, measurement and product marketing, we are more relevant in market and can drive revenue growth more quickly. We have made a lot of progress in getting these resources in place this year and are excited about their potential to make a meaningful impact. We continue to invest heavily in our video advertising products. We partnered with the global Dentsu team on their attention economy study where Snapchat commercials were shown to be more than twice the likely to be viewed and had 6x the attentive seconds per 1,000 impressions versus the digital ad platform average. Commercials have been a popular ad format with both large brands as well as performance advertisers. For example, Cashapp ran a multi-cell brand-lift study exploring the multiproduct effect of commercials in addition to Snapads. Users exposed to Snap Ads and commercial saw a 12-point increase in brand awareness, a 13-point increase in ad awareness and a five-point increase in action intent. Augmented reality represents one of our most exciting long-term revenue opportunities. AR is unique in that it is a fully immersive and interactive experience that delivers a measurable and repeatable return on investment for advertisers. In Q4, we saw many advertisers increase their investments into AR advertising by leveraging our GBB pixel purchase optimization for AR to bring unique experiences to Snapchatters, spanning verticals like makeup, retail, streaming, food delivery, technology and e-commerce. We have invested heavily into building tools and capabilities to make it easier for advertisers to create, manage and deploy their AR experiences. For example, cosmetics company MAC utilized our self-service lens web builder tool, which is now broadly available to all beauty brands to build several AR try-on makeup lenses. The campaign ultimately drove 1.3 million try-ons, a 2.4x higher lift in brand awareness and 9x higher lift in intent and among female Snapchatters a 17x higher lift in purchases. These type of results are emblematic of a larger shift we are seeing with AR transforming e-commerce. We believe that AR represents a consumer-centric shift in how our community shops and experiences new products with virtual try-on and visualization, allowing consumers to make the leap from this looks good to this looks good on me. This leap could help lower returns and increase conversion rates for retailers. Our focus is to reduce the friction in creating and distributing AR experiences on and off Snapchat. After a successful beta program, last week, we fully rolled out our new catalog-powered shopping lenses, a completely new format built to enable shopping through the use of augmented reality. Each lens features a product card, where Snapchatters are able to see real-time information about a product name, price and description. It also gives product level insights into the performance of specific SKUs, allowing much richer feedback for the advertiser. This supports our priority of driving ROI for advertising partners as it gives them much richer signals for delivery and optimization. For example, Ulta Beauty has been activating an always-on AR approach to beta testing catalog-powered shopping lenses. This campaign generated $6 million in purchases on Snapchat and over 30 million product trends. More early adopters are seeing lenses drive significant increases in return on ad spend and conversion with this new format, and we are excited to invest in this for 2022. We demonstrated the resilience of our business, our team and our advertising solutions in 2021 in the face of ongoing macro challenges and changes in the digital advertising industry. These challenges are not behind us, but we are increasingly confident in our ability to navigate them. We have a large and engaged audience, and we remain focused on supporting our advertising partners by driving ROI through optimization and measurement investing in our sales and marketing functions and building innovative ad experiences around video and augmented reality. We are confident in our long-term trajectory and excited to execute against our priorities in 2022. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Derek.\nDerek Andersen: Thanks, Jeremi. Our Q4 financial results reflect our priorities of growing our community, making focused investments in the future of our business and scaling our operations efficiently in order to drive towards profitability and positive free cash flow. As Evan mentioned earlier, our community grew to 319 million daily active users in Q4, an increase of 54 million or 20% year-over-year. In North America, DAU grew by five million or 6% year-over-year to reach 97 million. In Europe, DAU grew by eight million or 11% year-over-year to reach 82 million. In rest of world, DAU grew by 40 million or 41% year-over-year to reach 140 million as we continue to execute against the international growth playbook we laid out at our Investor Day one year-ago, including investments in local language support, local content, local marketing partnerships and support for local creator communities. Total revenue for Q4 was 1.298 billion, an increase of 42% year-over-year, down from 57% in the prior quarter, but exceeding our expectations entering the quarter. At a high level, the macro headwinds we anticipated entering the quarter materialized largely as we expected, but our direct response advertising business began to recover from the impact of the iOS platform changes quicker than we anticipated. The macro headwinds included supply chain disruptions and labor-related factors, which impacted our brand advertising business most directly with the consumer packaged goods and restaurant sectors of the brand business being impacted most significantly. These headwinds and their impact on growth rates for upper funnel objectives commonly utilized as part of brand campaigns such as impressions and views were the largest contributors to the sequential decline in year-over-year growth in Q4. Excluding the restaurant and CPG sectors, revenue from our brand advertising business grew at approximately 49% year-over-year, indicating what we believe to be continued strong underlying momentum in areas not impacted by the supply chain and labor issues noted earlier. In Q4, we experienced better-than-anticipated demand from direct response advertising partners. And our Direct Response advertising business was once again the largest driver of our growth. We observed that advertisers began to recover from the initial disruption caused by the iOS platform changes and the resulting impact on the ability of our advertising partners to measure the results of their advertising investments. Entering Q4, third-party solutions such as SKAdNetwork or Scan, were already widely enabled by our advertising partners. By the end of Q4, our first-party Advance Conversions measurement solution was enabled for advertisers representing more than 75% of direct response advertising revenue. We experienced strong growth across a variety of mid- and lower funnel gold-based bidding objectives, such as app install, pixel purchase, pixel sign-up and swipes with revenue from each growing at 50% or better year-over-year in Q4. Our app install objective had been among the most negatively impacted GBBs in the prior quarter. And it is return to 50% year-over-year growth was a key driver of our results exceeding our expectations entering the quarter. A smaller subset of lower funnel app-based GBBs, such as in-app purchase, which have historically comprised a smaller portion of the Direct Response business, continue to be the most impacted by the limitations of Scan, such as relatively high volume thresholds to return any result for a campaign. With the rapid enablement of our first-party measurement solutions, we are cautiously optimistic that the partners who utilize these lower funnel GBBs will begin to benefit from the more complete and timely measurement of results that these solutions afford. While we are pleased with the progress we have made with our Direct Response business in Q4, we expect that it will be at least a couple more quarters before advertisers have broadly utilized these tools for optimization and measurement of their campaigns, calibrated the results against the lift they see in their business and ultimately build confidence in these solutions as a result. Average ECPM increased 46% year-over-year in Q4, driven in large part by the increase in aggregate demand. We shared last quarter that we had experienced rising cost per action, or CPA, in Q3 as we navigated the impact of the iOS platform changes. We made significant progress on the front in Q4, resulting in improved CPA trends. For example, in North America, we observed a sequential decline in the average CPA for both Pixel purchase and app install despite rapid sequential growth and demand for each. Continuing to improve our optimization and measurement solutions is a top priority as we seek to deliver attractive returns on advertising spend for our advertising partners. Gross margins were 66% in Q4, an increase of approximately six percentage point year-over-year and six percentage points sequentially. Infrastructure costs per DAU was $0.66 in Q4, down from $0.69 in the prior year and consistent with the prior quarter with global ARPU growing at 18% year-over-year and infrastructure per DAU declining by 4% over the same period, efficient scaling of our cloud infrastructure was the largest driver of expanding gross margins. Content costs as a percentage of revenue declined by approximately four percentage points year-over-year and was the next largest driver of the gross margin improvement. During Q4, we completed a new multiyear agreement with one of our cloud infrastructure partners, and we anticipate concluding a new agreement with our other large cloud partner this year, which we expect will help contribute to further unit cost reductions in the future. Operating expenses were 530 million in Q4, up 44% year-over-year. As we expected, our rate of hiring stepped up in Q4. Total employee-related costs were up 42% year-over-year, driven by a 47% increase in full-time head count. This reflects ongoing investments in our team as well as the integration of acquisitions made over the past year, which contributed approximately 11 percentage points of the year-over-year growth in full-time head count. Marketing was the next largest driver of year-over-year operating expense growth as we continue to invest in marketing programs to build on the momentum we have established in growing our community of Snapchatters and advertising partners. Adjusted EBITDA was 327 million in Q4, an improvement of 161 million year-over-year. We delivered adjusted EBITDA leverage of 42% in Q4 as we continue to invest in the future of our business while making progress towards sustained profitability and positive free cash flow. Net income was 23 million in Q4, an improvement of 136 million over the prior year, representing net income leverage of 35% and marking our first quarter of GAAP profitability. This reflects the flow-through of the $161 million improvement in adjusted EBITDA and as well as 32 million higher gains on investments driven largely by unrealized gains on now publicly traded investments and 25 million lower interest expense reflecting the impact of the change in accounting standards for convertible notes. These factors were partially offset by 77 million higher stock-based compensation. While headcount growth is the largest driver of this expense, the impact of long-term retention associated with acquisitions and the impact of higher payroll-related taxes due to our higher stock price relative to the prior year also contributed to the increase. While we have continued to grow our team and leverage stock-based compensation strategically to foster an ownership culture and drive long-term retention, we have remained focused on managing these programs responsibly. Total fully diluted shares grew 4.4% year-over-year, with the vast majority of this growth driven by 1.1 billion of early conversions of our outstanding convertible notes completed in 2021. Excluding dilution related to convertible notes, the rate of growth was 1.2% in Q4 compared with 1.3% in the prior quarter and 3.4% in the prior year. While we are pleased with the progress we have made on this metric, it is important to note that the dilution rate, in particular as it relates to SBC, tends to move inversely with our stock price, all else being equal, and thus can be subject to market forces over time. Free cash flow for Q4 was positive 161 million or a 230 million improvement versus the prior year, driven primarily by the improvement in adjusted EBITDA noted earlier as well as improvements in net working capital. We ended the quarter with 3.7 billion in cash and marketable securities, up from 2.5 billion in the prior year as the proceeds of convertible notes issued over the past year more than offset the investments we have made to grow the business over the same period. Before we discuss the quarter ahead, I would like to provide an update on our full-year results. Growth in our community accelerated in 2021, with full-year average DAU up 22% year-over-year compared to 19% in 2020. Revenue reached 4.1 billion in 2021, an increase of 64% year-over-year, which is the highest rate of annual growth we have observed as a public company. Our revenue has more than doubled since 2019 with a two-year top line CAGR of 55%. While we have invested aggressively in the future of our business in 2021, we expanded our gross margins by five percentage points and delivered 35% of our incremental revenue to the adjusted EBITDA line over the past year. We have now been adjusted EBITDA profitable for two consecutive years and produced our first quarter of net income profitability in Q4. In 2021, we achieved our first full-year of positive free cash flow at 223 million. This marks a critical turning point as we now have the self-fund the investments in the future of our business, which positions us better than ever before to pull forward our road maps to deliver for our community and our partners. Lastly, we made further progress in strengthening our balance sheet in 2021, ending the year with 3.7 billion in cash and marketable securities, 2.3 billion in outstanding convertible notes and with no debt maturing prior to 2025. We closed out 2021 with strong momentum across our platforms and a business that is well positioned for the future. As we look forward to Q1, the operating environment remains challenging. Many of the supply chain and labor-related headwinds our advertising partners faced in Q4 remain challenges as we enter Q1. In addition, while we made significant progress in navigating the iOS platform changes in Q4, we believe that it will take at least a couple more quarters for our advertising partners to build full confidence in our new measurement solutions. Lastly, the prior year comparisons are incrementally tougher as we enter 2022, with revenue growth having accelerated by four percentage points in Q1 of 2021. Given the progress we have made towards sustainable free cash flow generation and the abundance of opportunities we see to invest productively in our business, we expect 2022 to be a significant investment year. When the impact of new investments in 2022 are combined with the full-year impact of investments made in 2021, we expect that a smaller share of incremental revenue will flow through to adjusted EBITDA and net income in the year ahead. That said, we remain committed to sustained positive free cash flow generation and continued responsible management of our fully diluted share count. For Q1, our financial guidance assumes that DAU will be approximately 328 million to 330 million in Q1. On the monetization side, we currently estimate that Q1 revenue will be between 1.03 billion and 1.08 billion, implying year-over-year growth of between 34% and 38% in Q1. Given our revenue guidance and our planned level of investment, we expect to be approximately breakeven on adjusted EBITDA in Q1. Thank you for joining our call today, and we will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi it is [indiscernible] on for Brian Nowak. Thanks for taking our questions, we have two. The first question we have is, you have made a lot of progress around IDFA, and it seems like it will still take at least a couple of quarters to rebuild full confidence. Can you talk to us about the key technological or go-to-market areas you need to execute on in order to further close the IDFA measurement and attribution challenges and work to return ad growth closer to the Analyst Day targets of last year? And our second question is any update on new advertiser growth contribution in 4Q and how you think about advertiser growth contribution to 1Q? Thank you.\nJeremi Gorman: Thank you for the question. This is Jeremi. You are right, that we expect that it could take at least a couple more quarters for our advertising partners to calibrate to the instrument solutions against the results that they see in their businesses. They are utilizing litany of different triangulation tactics right now, including lift studies, AV studies and these kinds of things. And so we do expect it to take some time for them to build full confidence in these new tools. But with that being said, we are certainly pleased with the progress that we have made with our advertising partners in Q4. Advertisers that represent more than 75% of our DR revenue have now enabled our first-party measurement solutions and can use these tools alongside the third-party measurement solutions I just mentioned to optimize and measure their campaigns I think it is important to think of it as sort of a three-step journey. So first, advertisers need to enable, which makes it possible to use the tools, then they need to actively use them and then they need to build the trust and the confidence in these tools before there is broad adoption across the board. While we expect the changes to continue to impact our business and we anticipate there could be additional platform changes ahead, we remain confident in the long-term growth prospects from our Direct Response advertising business, as you have heard, and our ability to deliver results for our advertising partners in a privacy safe environment, which is increasingly important. Our teams are really focused on helping advertisers adopt our first-party solution. We have talked about that a bit, which is Advanced Conversions. And just to reiterate what that is, Advanced Conversions utilizes cryptographic techniques to measure aggregate conversion data. And it doesn\u2019t directly connect off-platform activities such app install or visiting a website back to specific Snapchatters. We are leveraging data privacy safe data processing pipelines and techniques as cohorting to match impression data provided by the advertiser. And we continue to improve that Advanced Conversions with features such as estimated conversions, which augments observed conversion data with real-time data to help in -- our advertisers make better decisions with their advertising dollars. And so we are really focused on helping advertisers adopt those solutions. And then to answer your second question regarding new advertiser growth contribution and how we think about that, as mentioned in our prepared remarks, Q4 saw active advertisers reach another all-time high. And we don\u2019t give guidance on the number of active advertisers. It is certainly our goal as part of the advertising demand flywheel to continue to grow the number of active advertisers on our platform. The more selection that we have of ads from which to choose for every impression, the more relevant, that impression can be to the Snapchatter and the focus on optimization and measurement continues to ensure that the Snapchatters are seeing the most relevant as for them and then subsequently, better conversion rates. And so over the course of 2021, we have beta tested several products to bring even more advertisers onboard and grow their business on Snapchat organically, which include public profile for businesses, and we are rolling that out more broadly. And then, of course, AR shopping lenses, which we talked about it and businesses can create and experiment those outside of advertising. And we are really excited about all of these in 2022 and beyond. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nEric Sheridan: Hi. Want to know if we could ask a quick question following up on the front part of the call. The long-term initiatives you are looking at on product and content and partnerships. Can we get a little deeper on what that might mean for 2022 and 2023 and how it flows back into the investment cycle? Thank you.\nEvan Spiegel: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. We are really excited about the long-term here in particular to what we are seeing is a lot of momentum around augmented reality today on Snapchat. So there are over 200 million people engaging with AR every day. I think people are playing with Lenses and Snapchat over six billion times, using our camera every day. And what we are doing now is taking all this technology and not only continuing to improve it for developers, but also to make it much more accessible for businesses and to help them specifically in e-commerce and retail help consumers try on their products and convert easily through our camera. So a lot of our investments in the near and medium term are really around smartphone augmented reality because we just see such a massive opportunity there. And then looking a definitely excited about the evolution of our Lens Studio developer tools and how that will support augmented reality on our Spectacles glasses in the future. We released our first version of stand-alone AR glasses last year and continuing to build on that and evolve that platform. So a lot to do on smartphone AR today in the near and medium term and then, of course, building to the long-term future of computing overlaid on the world.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the Justin Post with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJustin Post - BofA Securities: Great. Thanks for taking my question. A couple. You made a lot of ARPU progress over the last two years, but still some services aren\u2019t monetized yet. So maybe give us a refresher on where you are in the ARPU journey and then, of course, the question of the day is it looks like your IDFA-related headwinds could be less than peers. Maybe you could talk a little bit more about why that could be? Thank you.\nDerek Andersen: Hi Justin, it is Derek speaking. I will take these two. I think the first question related to ARPU, we are still really early in our journey here, and I believe we continue to have a lot of room to grow on the ARPU side. Today, we generate most of our revenue from our content business. And with continued optimization, ECPM growth and the expansion of the content business by Spotlight, we continue to see lots of room to grow here. I think importantly, as you mentioned, we already have a lot of engagement on screens that are currently either monetized relatively little or not at all, including the camera and the map, in particular. And we do monetize the camera today, but given that our app opens to the camera and the vast majority of Snapchatters engaged with AR every day, we already have immense inventory potential on the screen, and we are investing heavily to build out our AR advertising products there. On the Map, we are not monetizing today, but we are working on the building blocks of utility for the approximately 30 million places to populate our Map, and we are excited about the potential for the Map to be an on-ramp to a new category of advertisers over time. So there is a lot to do and we are investing heavily in executing against what we believe is a well-organized plan in order to capture that ARPU opportunity over time, which we see ahead of us. So the second question on the IDFA-related headwinds. I think we have built our business with privacy by design at the core of our products, including our advertising platform. And as a result, the impacts of the changes that we have seen on the iOS platform are likely to be experienced differently for our business than perhaps for others. ATT significantly disrupted the way in which our advertising partners have been accustomed to targeting and measuring the results of their advertising investments. This had significant disruptive impacts on their businesses and advertising demand for us as a result, when those changes were implemented. And we see those impacts manifesting themselves in two real primary ways. The first is in how we are able to optimize advertising for our partners, including how we get the right ad in front of the right Snapchatter at the right moment in a privacy safe way. We began working on that part of the problem more than a year ago. And as a result, we were able to make a lot of progress before those iOS platform changes disrupted the market. In many cases, we believe that we were able to make significant progress in closing those gaps. In part because we have been focused and nimble, but in part also because our business starts from a privacy safe set of principles. That said, we are still very early in the journey on optimization and have significant headroom to deliver more advertiser value over time. The second impact is really around measurement. And we spoke last quarter about how we saw this as the most pressing issue for our business as the iOS platform changes were implemented. We believe then and we believe now that our ad platform continues to deliver results for our advertising partners, but our advertisers would need to adopt new tools to measure and see those results. Entering the quarter, Scan or SKAdnetwork was already broadly enabled for our advertisers. But over Q4, we saw progress on enablement of our first-party solutions. And by the end of the quarter, advertisers to represent more than 75% of our DR revenue were enabled for our first-party measurement solutions. So we still have more work to do to drive why utilization of these new solutions and build for confidence in them amongst our partner, but we are pleased with the progress we have made so far. So I hope that gives you a little bit of context than what we are seeing in this area and how we have approached it over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rich Greenfield with LightShed Partners. Please go ahead.\nRichard Greenfield: Hi. A couple of questions. One, DAUs obviously look good. I mean, I guess, solid is the best word, to say it. But I think if you could maybe just help us a little bit understand what is going on under the surface, especially in the U.S. As you think about sort of time spent engagement, however you want to think about it, sequentially and year-over-year. Obviously, investors have been very concerned over the last 24-hours about what TikTok is doing to companies like Meta. What is actually happening in terms of time spent and engagement on the Snapchat platform, especially in the U.S. where your monetization is still outsized? And then two, I have seen obviously, in the prepared remarks, I think Jeremi called out brand spend in terms of the headwinds that you saw in Q4. And I think you had talked about CPG and restaurants being key areas. I was wondering - I know you are still seeing supply chain issues, but has there been any improvement in Q1 through the first - essentially month of Q1 versus what you saw in Q4 on the brand spend side?\nEvan Spiegel: Thanks, Rich, for the question. I can talk a little bit about engagement. I think we have worked really hard over the years to diversify our product offering beyond just communicating with friends and family, into Stories, of course, in our Map and now with Spotlight. And I think what we are seeing with the growth of our user base overall is that people are coming to Snap for all sorts of different reasons and then migrating across our different products. So while we certainly compete with TikTok and Instagram and YouTube for video entertainment, we also have different areas of our service like our Map or our AR platform where we see a really strong engagement. And I think as it pertains to stories in particular and growth in video, I talked a little bit following on some of our prior earnings calls about the trends we are seeing throughout the pandemic, where we are seeing people post fewer stories for their friends, view fewer stories from their friends. But at the same time, we have seen folks watching more premium content, watching more content Spotlight. So there is a bit of a mix shift there. Some of our user studies, for example, when we talk to our community, they say, gosh, during the pandemic, I haven\u2019t been able to do as many cool things out with my friends. So I\u2019m posting less stories or stories are less interesting because my friends aren\u2019t doing as many cool things. So we will have to see how that progresses. Obviously, the Omicron thing was a little bit of a setback there for us. But overall, the core of Snapchat is really about friends and family. And I think we offer a really differentiated product, not only with stories and some of our entertainment products, but across our entire service in all of our different platforms.\nJeremi Gorman: And I can take the second part, Rich. Thank you very much for the question. You talked about restaurants as well as CPG and the reality is that we haven\u2019t seen a lot of change in those particular areas, the supply labor disruptions did materialize as expected, and they still remain unsolved in the new year and result in new year. But I think that when you look at the revenue and you kind of break it down, excluding the restaurant and CPG sectors, revenue from our brand advertising business grew at give or take 49% year-over-year and that indicates what we believe to be continued strong underlying momentum in our areas not impacted by supply chain and labor issues noted earlier. We expect this to continue these macro conditions that continue to impact advertising demand as, in many cases, just practically speaking, their businesses don\u2019t have the inventory or operational capacity to support incremental demand brought on by marketing. But in addition, we have plenty of categories, particularly with brands that aren\u2019t as reliant on supply chain. We have redeployed resources to many of those verticals, and they continue to perform well. Examples of that are travel, streaming, financial services amongst others. And it is really great that we have been able to develop these nimble and agile teams and support them and train them on categories that may not be their core competency to ensure that we can take advantage of the tailwind categories and shift some things away from the headwind categories, but it is really important for us to continue to support the categories that may be facing some headwinds as they are long-term. Absolutely our partners and we continue to invest in them, learn with them, grow with them and pivot our resources accordingly to make sure we can take advantage of areas where there are tailwinds. But thank you for the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRoss Sandler: Jeremi, I guess just following up on that last question. So if we had to size the revenue bucket that is kind of still in the iOS negative impact zone, I guess, these lower funnel GBB campaigns you mentioned earlier, is that like 25%? Is it 30% of Snap\u2019s business? And how much is the revenue growth that impacted in that area? And then alternatively, if we look at the other 70%, 75% of revenue at Snap that is not in the impact zone. Is it fair to say that that is growing kind of consistent with your kind of 50% long-term goal now and in the foreseeable future? And then the second question is -- I\u2019m sorry, this is a little long winded, but when you guys say that DR recovered faster than expected, is it that the monthly spend from the DR advertisers is actually increasing right now as they adopt new tools and make these changes with Pixel, et cetera or do they just have better visibility and the spend is going to increase in a couple of quarters when the recovery in revenue actually happens? Thanks a lot.\nDerek Andersen: Hey Ross, it is Derek speaking. I will take those questions as best I can remember all of them. So I think the first question was just around the components of our business and how many of them are really impacted by the various headwinds I think it is fair to say that in Q4, the headwinds we faced were contained to a limited portion of our business. And the top line results reflect that, obviously. At a high level, we anticipated that we would likely face some macro headwinds related to supply chain factors and labor factors in Q4. And we did see that. And as I mentioned in prepared remarks, that was largely contained to a couple of sectors within our brand advertising business, in particular, the restaurants and CPG categories that are impacted by labor and supply chain and Importantly, though, outside of those two sectors, revenue from our brand advertising business grew at nearly 50% year-over-year, indicating what we believe to be pretty strong, continued underlying momentum in that business. And then on the DR side, similarly, we saw a really strong return in growth across a number of our mid- and lower funnel goal-based bidding objectives, things like app install and Pixel purchase and so on with a large number of those growing at rates of 50% or better in some cases year-over-year. But we did similarly see pockets of the DR business and in particular, the lowest down-funnel app-based objectives such as in-app purchase were ones that were continuing to be impacted most directly by some of the iOS platform changes, including the limitations of Scan, where there are relatively high thresholds to return any results for a campaign. And so there is obviously work that we are doing there, as I mentioned in prepared remarks, around the enablement of our first-party measurement solutions, which help to fill in some of those measurement gaps, including the limitations of that threshold so. So when I think about our results overall, you can see that big parts of the DR business growing at those elevated rates and big parts of the brand business growing at elevated rates. But we are dealing with a couple of headwinds at the same time across those businesses and the macro factors and the platform changes. And so you have got pockets of the business and the minority of each side that are impacting things. So hopefully, that gives you a good sense of what is happening and what pockets of the business it is limited to. Thanks very much and hopefully, that gives you the context you need there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi this is Katie on for Doug. First, I just want to dig into users. Your annual DAU net adds improved in both 2020 and again in 2021. So I\u2019m curious how you are thinking about net adds into 2022 relative to pre-pandemic levels you saw in 2019? Then second, I\u2019m curious just your updated views regarding competition. It feels like many social peers have called outcome is intensifying broadly in the industry. How are your efforts in visual communication differentiating the product and experience relative to others in the space? Thanks.\nEvan Spiegel: On the first part of the question, I believe, in terms of net adds you are thinking about specifically DAU in that area and our growth in that sector. So one, I think we laid out at our Investor Day a little over a year ago, our international playbook and investments that we plan to make in order to grow the community globally. We have continued to execute against that plan over the last year, including significant investments in local content, local marketing partnerships and building our local creator community, and we continue to execute against that plan and seen strong results as a result of that. In particular, I would note that this was our fifth consecutive quarter of 20% better year-over-year growth, including 54 million total DAU. So good momentum on the community base there. We are going to continue to execute against that playbook and invest in our platform and our products in order to support the growth of our community over time. So hopefully, that gives a little perspective about what we are seeing there.\nDerek Andersen: I can speak a little bit to just competition, how we think about it. It is a highly competitive area. It always has been. When we created Snap, Facebook and Instagram and YouTube and WhatsApp all those products already existed and were already really, really big. And so Snap has always been able to grow really through our continuous product innovation and focusing on our community. And we identified really early on that people want to express themselves visually through our camera. We then took that and built that into our Stories product where people can share about their day in a narrative fashion. We learned that people want to see what is happening all around the world, so we built our Map. And more recently, of course, we have built Spotlight to highlight the best of Snapchat. And so we are continually innovating and evolving our products. We believe that is the only way to compete long-term in the tech industry, and we are very excited about the future of augmented reality where we are investing a lot of our time. And that is really where a lot of our growth over the longer term is unconstrained in terms of our innovation as we are building out new products like Spectacles and continuing to evolve our AR platform. So we are really excited about our ability to continue this product momentum. And ultimately, our ability to win here in the long-term is going to come down to innovation, as it always has.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. Please go ahead.\nLloyd Walmsley: Great. Two questions on the AR advertising side. I guess, first, what are you guys seeing in terms of advertiser adoption? Are you seeing it pick up amongst DR advertisers and through the self-serve platform or is it still mostly bought on an awareness basis? And then second one from kind of the client perspective, what are you seeing in terms of maybe revenue retention, do advertisers come spend on lenses and keep growing that and how is kind of catalog shopping change conversations with advertisers? Thanks.\nJeremi Gorman: Thank you so much for the question. I\u2019m very happy that you asked it. We certainly believe that the camera and augmented reality represent our most exciting long-term revenue opportunity. And we are seeing that with brands, they are starting to build ways on AR strategies for their businesses, and we are delivering results against that. I think the great thing about augmented reality is that it is a fully immersive experience that Snapchatters choose to engage with versus something that is passive or served to them and it is now delivering a return on investments businesses that is both measurable and repeatable. So to your point, that is something that is incredibly important for direct response advertisers. And that is encouraging more and more businesses to invest in augmented reality. You are right that when we initially launched AR for advertisers, it was kind of seen as this next shiny thing, a big brand moment, something that was a little bit more fun in their reference. But over time, we have been evolving the way that businesses think about it as more than just an ad format, but an experience that brands can build to grow their businesses. We have invested really heavily into building the tools and capabilities to make it easier to create augmented reality, which then allows it to be a part of people always on ecosystems to manage those, deploy their AR experiences. And you heard in the prepared remarks, us talk about results from the likes of MAC and Ulta, who are starting to see just incredible results with at 1.3 million try-ons, for example, on the MAC lens that was using our lens web builder tool, I think, is the best example of that. And when advertisers start to see results like that, you can imagine it is highly retentive and look alike advertisers want to start doing a lot of the same work so that they can get cost per try on down, utilizing augmented reality. These types of results that we are seeing from those two particular companies are emblematic of a larger shift that we are seeing with AR transforming e-commerce. And e-commerce is obviously a secular trend. They like to continue to grow, and we will grow right alongside it with AR as these consumer-centric ships continue to happen. And we are really excited about the future of augmented reality as a product, particularly as it delivers results for incredible advertisers with great measurement solutions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nBrent Thill: Derek, a couple of quick ones for you. One on the mix of price versus the production growth. If you could just give us your thoughts and what you are seeing there. And secondarily, everyone realizes that the goal you gave at Investor Day is most likely on ice in the short-term for 50% plus revenue growth. But how are you and the team thinking about the long-term still on that commitment to that goal? Thanks.\nDerek Andersen: Brian, it is Derek speaking. Thanks for the question. In terms of the impression and pricing growth, I think, first, obviously, we did observe rising CPMs in Q4. We were up 46% year-over-year, driven by the really significant sequential and year-over-year rise in demand. At a high level, we continue to think of ECPM at least in part as an output metric at this stage in our growth. We still believe we have room to grow ECPM across many of our ad units, but there are several competing forces that influence CPM, many of which we have influence over and they can put downward pressure on ECPM. So one such factor is growth in our community and our community has grown at rates of 20% or better for five consecutive quarters now. The second is the potential to expand our inventory opportunity by expanding monetization of highly engaged areas of our application, including the camera, Spotlight and map, among others that we talked about earlier today. And then each of these screens, there are different levels and stages of their evolution around monetization. We are monetizing the camera today, and we are heavily investing in the advertising capabilities for the long-term there. But we have not yet begun to monetize spotlight of the map, and we don\u2019t feel urgency to do so in the very near-term, but we are investing to grow these platforms today and are excited about the potential for those screens to expand our inventory and ARPU over time. On the other side of this equation, there is improvements in optimization and measurement of our direct response business, which can help us to utilize our inventory more efficiently, and that tends to put upward pressure on ECPMs. So for example, in our most recent quarter in North America, we observed a sequential decline in the average CPA for both Pixel purchase and app install GBBs despite the rapid sequential growth in demand for each of those. So continuing to evolve and adapt or optimization and learning solutions over time is important to helping us deliver attractive return for advertisers and also has impacts on eCPM. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of an understanding of how we see the dynamics under the hood there on pricing over time. So in terms of the longer-term potential, I think the first thing I would say here is we continue to believe that the building blocks supporting our longer-term opportunity remain intact as we described them at our Investor Day. And as a result, we are where we believe we can go with the business over the next few years remains unchanged. So for example, on the building blocks, our community is growing at some of the fastest rates we have reported more than four years. We continue to have deep penetration of hard-to-reach audiences in some of the most attractive advertising markets in the world. And we continue to have significant opportunities to expand the monetization across our screens as we just talked about. But as I said when we met last quarter, the path to getting to that longer-term ARPU opportunity in the longer-term monetization potential of the platform was never expected to be and is in a straight line. We have now delivered a two-year CAGR on top line revenue of 55%. But over that two-year period, we have had quarters where year-over-year revenue growth was as low as 17% and as high as [16%] as we navigated our way through macro headwinds, platform changes and a pandemic. So throughout all of this, we have been and we are going to continue to be focused on executing against what we believe is a really well-organized plan in order to deliver on that long-term potential that we see ahead. So hopefully, that gives you some context on how we think about this and what we see ahead.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session as well as Snap Inc.\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Derek Andersen",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeremi. Our Q4 financial results reflect our priorities of growing our community, making focused investments in the future of our business and scaling our operations efficiently in order to drive towards profitability and positive free cash flow. As Evan mentioned earlier, our community grew to 319 million daily active users in Q4, an increase of 54 million or 20% year-over-year. In North America, DAU grew by five million or 6% year-over-year to reach 97 million. In Europe, DAU grew by eight million or 11% year-over-year to reach 82 million. In rest of world, DAU grew by 40 million or 41% year-over-year to reach 140 million as we continue to execute against the international growth playbook we laid out at our Investor Day one year-ago, including investments in local language support, local content, local marketing partnerships and support for local creator communities. Total revenue for Q4 was 1.298 billion, an increase of 42% year-over-year, down from 57% in the prior quarter, but exceeding our expectations entering the quarter. At a high level, the macro headwinds we anticipated entering the quarter materialized largely as we expected, but our direct response advertising business began to recover from the impact of the iOS platform changes quicker than we anticipated. The macro headwinds included supply chain disruptions and labor-related factors, which impacted our brand advertising business most directly with the consumer packaged goods and restaurant sectors of the brand business being impacted most significantly. These headwinds and their impact on growth rates for upper funnel objectives commonly utilized as part of brand campaigns such as impressions and views were the largest contributors to the sequential decline in year-over-year growth in Q4. Excluding the restaurant and CPG sectors, revenue from our brand advertising business grew at approximately 49% year-over-year, indicating what we believe to be continued strong underlying momentum in areas not impacted by the supply chain and labor issues noted earlier. In Q4, we experienced better-than-anticipated demand from direct response advertising partners. And our Direct Response advertising business was once again the largest driver of our growth. We observed that advertisers began to recover from the initial disruption caused by the iOS platform changes and the resulting impact on the ability of our advertising partners to measure the results of their advertising investments. Entering Q4, third-party solutions such as SKAdNetwork or Scan, were already widely enabled by our advertising partners. By the end of Q4, our first-party Advance Conversions measurement solution was enabled for advertisers representing more than 75% of direct response advertising revenue. We experienced strong growth across a variety of mid- and lower funnel gold-based bidding objectives, such as app install, pixel purchase, pixel sign-up and swipes with revenue from each growing at 50% or better year-over-year in Q4. Our app install objective had been among the most negatively impacted GBBs in the prior quarter. And it is return to 50% year-over-year growth was a key driver of our results exceeding our expectations entering the quarter. A smaller subset of lower funnel app-based GBBs, such as in-app purchase, which have historically comprised a smaller portion of the Direct Response business, continue to be the most impacted by the limitations of Scan, such as relatively high volume thresholds to return any result for a campaign. With the rapid enablement of our first-party measurement solutions, we are cautiously optimistic that the partners who utilize these lower funnel GBBs will begin to benefit from the more complete and timely measurement of results that these solutions afford. While we are pleased with the progress we have made with our Direct Response business in Q4, we expect that it will be at least a couple more quarters before advertisers have broadly utilized these tools for optimization and measurement of their campaigns, calibrated the results against the lift they see in their business and ultimately build confidence in these solutions as a result. Average ECPM increased 46% year-over-year in Q4, driven in large part by the increase in aggregate demand. We shared last quarter that we had experienced rising cost per action, or CPA, in Q3 as we navigated the impact of the iOS platform changes. We made significant progress on the front in Q4, resulting in improved CPA trends. For example, in North America, we observed a sequential decline in the average CPA for both Pixel purchase and app install despite rapid sequential growth and demand for each. Continuing to improve our optimization and measurement solutions is a top priority as we seek to deliver attractive returns on advertising spend for our advertising partners. Gross margins were 66% in Q4, an increase of approximately six percentage point year-over-year and six percentage points sequentially. Infrastructure costs per DAU was $0.66 in Q4, down from $0.69 in the prior year and consistent with the prior quarter with global ARPU growing at 18% year-over-year and infrastructure per DAU declining by 4% over the same period, efficient scaling of our cloud infrastructure was the largest driver of expanding gross margins. Content costs as a percentage of revenue declined by approximately four percentage points year-over-year and was the next largest driver of the gross margin improvement. During Q4, we completed a new multiyear agreement with one of our cloud infrastructure partners, and we anticipate concluding a new agreement with our other large cloud partner this year, which we expect will help contribute to further unit cost reductions in the future. Operating expenses were 530 million in Q4, up 44% year-over-year. As we expected, our rate of hiring stepped up in Q4. Total employee-related costs were up 42% year-over-year, driven by a 47% increase in full-time head count. This reflects ongoing investments in our team as well as the integration of acquisitions made over the past year, which contributed approximately 11 percentage points of the year-over-year growth in full-time head count. Marketing was the next largest driver of year-over-year operating expense growth as we continue to invest in marketing programs to build on the momentum we have established in growing our community of Snapchatters and advertising partners. Adjusted EBITDA was 327 million in Q4, an improvement of 161 million year-over-year. We delivered adjusted EBITDA leverage of 42% in Q4 as we continue to invest in the future of our business while making progress towards sustained profitability and positive free cash flow. Net income was 23 million in Q4, an improvement of 136 million over the prior year, representing net income leverage of 35% and marking our first quarter of GAAP profitability. This reflects the flow-through of the $161 million improvement in adjusted EBITDA and as well as 32 million higher gains on investments driven largely by unrealized gains on now publicly traded investments and 25 million lower interest expense reflecting the impact of the change in accounting standards for convertible notes. These factors were partially offset by 77 million higher stock-based compensation. While headcount growth is the largest driver of this expense, the impact of long-term retention associated with acquisitions and the impact of higher payroll-related taxes due to our higher stock price relative to the prior year also contributed to the increase. While we have continued to grow our team and leverage stock-based compensation strategically to foster an ownership culture and drive long-term retention, we have remained focused on managing these programs responsibly. Total fully diluted shares grew 4.4% year-over-year, with the vast majority of this growth driven by 1.1 billion of early conversions of our outstanding convertible notes completed in 2021. Excluding dilution related to convertible notes, the rate of growth was 1.2% in Q4 compared with 1.3% in the prior quarter and 3.4% in the prior year. While we are pleased with the progress we have made on this metric, it is important to note that the dilution rate, in particular as it relates to SBC, tends to move inversely with our stock price, all else being equal, and thus can be subject to market forces over time. Free cash flow for Q4 was positive 161 million or a 230 million improvement versus the prior year, driven primarily by the improvement in adjusted EBITDA noted earlier as well as improvements in net working capital. We ended the quarter with 3.7 billion in cash and marketable securities, up from 2.5 billion in the prior year as the proceeds of convertible notes issued over the past year more than offset the investments we have made to grow the business over the same period. Before we discuss the quarter ahead, I would like to provide an update on our full-year results. Growth in our community accelerated in 2021, with full-year average DAU up 22% year-over-year compared to 19% in 2020. Revenue reached 4.1 billion in 2021, an increase of 64% year-over-year, which is the highest rate of annual growth we have observed as a public company. Our revenue has more than doubled since 2019 with a two-year top line CAGR of 55%. While we have invested aggressively in the future of our business in 2021, we expanded our gross margins by five percentage points and delivered 35% of our incremental revenue to the adjusted EBITDA line over the past year. We have now been adjusted EBITDA profitable for two consecutive years and produced our first quarter of net income profitability in Q4. In 2021, we achieved our first full-year of positive free cash flow at 223 million. This marks a critical turning point as we now have the self-fund the investments in the future of our business, which positions us better than ever before to pull forward our road maps to deliver for our community and our partners. Lastly, we made further progress in strengthening our balance sheet in 2021, ending the year with 3.7 billion in cash and marketable securities, 2.3 billion in outstanding convertible notes and with no debt maturing prior to 2025. We closed out 2021 with strong momentum across our platforms and a business that is well positioned for the future. As we look forward to Q1, the operating environment remains challenging. Many of the supply chain and labor-related headwinds our advertising partners faced in Q4 remain challenges as we enter Q1. In addition, while we made significant progress in navigating the iOS platform changes in Q4, we believe that it will take at least a couple more quarters for our advertising partners to build full confidence in our new measurement solutions. Lastly, the prior year comparisons are incrementally tougher as we enter 2022, with revenue growth having accelerated by four percentage points in Q1 of 2021. Given the progress we have made towards sustainable free cash flow generation and the abundance of opportunities we see to invest productively in our business, we expect 2022 to be a significant investment year. When the impact of new investments in 2022 are combined with the full-year impact of investments made in 2021, we expect that a smaller share of incremental revenue will flow through to adjusted EBITDA and net income in the year ahead. That said, we remain committed to sustained positive free cash flow generation and continued responsible management of our fully diluted share count. For Q1, our financial guidance assumes that DAU will be approximately 328 million to 330 million in Q1. On the monetization side, we currently estimate that Q1 revenue will be between 1.03 billion and 1.08 billion, implying year-over-year growth of between 34% and 38% in Q1. Given our revenue guidance and our planned level of investment, we expect to be approximately breakeven on adjusted EBITDA in Q1. Thank you for joining our call today, and we will now take your questions. Hi Justin, it is Derek speaking. I will take these two. I think the first question related to ARPU, we are still really early in our journey here, and I believe we continue to have a lot of room to grow on the ARPU side. Today, we generate most of our revenue from our content business. And with continued optimization, ECPM growth and the expansion of the content business by Spotlight, we continue to see lots of room to grow here. I think importantly, as you mentioned, we already have a lot of engagement on screens that are currently either monetized relatively little or not at all, including the camera and the map, in particular. And we do monetize the camera today, but given that our app opens to the camera and the vast majority of Snapchatters engaged with AR every day, we already have immense inventory potential on the screen, and we are investing heavily to build out our AR advertising products there. On the Map, we are not monetizing today, but we are working on the building blocks of utility for the approximately 30 million places to populate our Map, and we are excited about the potential for the Map to be an on-ramp to a new category of advertisers over time. So there is a lot to do and we are investing heavily in executing against what we believe is a well-organized plan in order to capture that ARPU opportunity over time, which we see ahead of us. So the second question on the IDFA-related headwinds. I think we have built our business with privacy by design at the core of our products, including our advertising platform. And as a result, the impacts of the changes that we have seen on the iOS platform are likely to be experienced differently for our business than perhaps for others. ATT significantly disrupted the way in which our advertising partners have been accustomed to targeting and measuring the results of their advertising investments. This had significant disruptive impacts on their businesses and advertising demand for us as a result, when those changes were implemented. And we see those impacts manifesting themselves in two real primary ways. The first is in how we are able to optimize advertising for our partners, including how we get the right ad in front of the right Snapchatter at the right moment in a privacy safe way. We began working on that part of the problem more than a year ago. And as a result, we were able to make a lot of progress before those iOS platform changes disrupted the market. In many cases, we believe that we were able to make significant progress in closing those gaps. In part because we have been focused and nimble, but in part also because our business starts from a privacy safe set of principles. That said, we are still very early in the journey on optimization and have significant headroom to deliver more advertiser value over time. The second impact is really around measurement. And we spoke last quarter about how we saw this as the most pressing issue for our business as the iOS platform changes were implemented. We believe then and we believe now that our ad platform continues to deliver results for our advertising partners, but our advertisers would need to adopt new tools to measure and see those results. Entering the quarter, Scan or SKAdnetwork was already broadly enabled for our advertisers. But over Q4, we saw progress on enablement of our first-party solutions. And by the end of the quarter, advertisers to represent more than 75% of our DR revenue were enabled for our first-party measurement solutions. So we still have more work to do to drive why utilization of these new solutions and build for confidence in them amongst our partner, but we are pleased with the progress we have made so far. So I hope that gives you a little bit of context than what we are seeing in this area and how we have approached it over time. Hey Ross, it is Derek speaking. I will take those questions as best I can remember all of them. So I think the first question was just around the components of our business and how many of them are really impacted by the various headwinds I think it is fair to say that in Q4, the headwinds we faced were contained to a limited portion of our business. And the top line results reflect that, obviously. At a high level, we anticipated that we would likely face some macro headwinds related to supply chain factors and labor factors in Q4. And we did see that. And as I mentioned in prepared remarks, that was largely contained to a couple of sectors within our brand advertising business, in particular, the restaurants and CPG categories that are impacted by labor and supply chain and Importantly, though, outside of those two sectors, revenue from our brand advertising business grew at nearly 50% year-over-year, indicating what we believe to be pretty strong, continued underlying momentum in that business. And then on the DR side, similarly, we saw a really strong return in growth across a number of our mid- and lower funnel goal-based bidding objectives, things like app install and Pixel purchase and so on with a large number of those growing at rates of 50% or better in some cases year-over-year. But we did similarly see pockets of the DR business and in particular, the lowest down-funnel app-based objectives such as in-app purchase were ones that were continuing to be impacted most directly by some of the iOS platform changes, including the limitations of Scan, where there are relatively high thresholds to return any results for a campaign. And so there is obviously work that we are doing there, as I mentioned in prepared remarks, around the enablement of our first-party measurement solutions, which help to fill in some of those measurement gaps, including the limitations of that threshold so. So when I think about our results overall, you can see that big parts of the DR business growing at those elevated rates and big parts of the brand business growing at elevated rates. But we are dealing with a couple of headwinds at the same time across those businesses and the macro factors and the platform changes. And so you have got pockets of the business and the minority of each side that are impacting things. So hopefully, that gives you a good sense of what is happening and what pockets of the business it is limited to. Thanks very much and hopefully, that gives you the context you need there. I can speak a little bit to just competition, how we think about it. It is a highly competitive area. It always has been. When we created Snap, Facebook and Instagram and YouTube and WhatsApp all those products already existed and were already really, really big. And so Snap has always been able to grow really through our continuous product innovation and focusing on our community. And we identified really early on that people want to express themselves visually through our camera. We then took that and built that into our Stories product where people can share about their day in a narrative fashion. We learned that people want to see what is happening all around the world, so we built our Map. And more recently, of course, we have built Spotlight to highlight the best of Snapchat. And so we are continually innovating and evolving our products. We believe that is the only way to compete long-term in the tech industry, and we are very excited about the future of augmented reality where we are investing a lot of our time. And that is really where a lot of our growth over the longer term is unconstrained in terms of our innovation as we are building out new products like Spectacles and continuing to evolve our AR platform. So we are really excited about our ability to continue this product momentum. And ultimately, our ability to win here in the long-term is going to come down to innovation, as it always has. Brian, it is Derek speaking. Thanks for the question. In terms of the impression and pricing growth, I think, first, obviously, we did observe rising CPMs in Q4. We were up 46% year-over-year, driven by the really significant sequential and year-over-year rise in demand. At a high level, we continue to think of ECPM at least in part as an output metric at this stage in our growth. We still believe we have room to grow ECPM across many of our ad units, but there are several competing forces that influence CPM, many of which we have influence over and they can put downward pressure on ECPM. So one such factor is growth in our community and our community has grown at rates of 20% or better for five consecutive quarters now. The second is the potential to expand our inventory opportunity by expanding monetization of highly engaged areas of our application, including the camera, Spotlight and map, among others that we talked about earlier today. And then each of these screens, there are different levels and stages of their evolution around monetization. We are monetizing the camera today, and we are heavily investing in the advertising capabilities for the long-term there. But we have not yet begun to monetize spotlight of the map, and we don't feel urgency to do so in the very near-term, but we are investing to grow these platforms today and are excited about the potential for those screens to expand our inventory and ARPU over time. On the other side of this equation, there is improvements in optimization and measurement of our direct response business, which can help us to utilize our inventory more efficiently, and that tends to put upward pressure on ECPMs. So for example, in our most recent quarter in North America, we observed a sequential decline in the average CPA for both Pixel purchase and app install GBBs despite the rapid sequential growth in demand for each of those. So continuing to evolve and adapt or optimization and learning solutions over time is important to helping us deliver attractive return for advertisers and also has impacts on eCPM. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of an understanding of how we see the dynamics under the hood there on pricing over time. So in terms of the longer-term potential, I think the first thing I would say here is we continue to believe that the building blocks supporting our longer-term opportunity remain intact as we described them at our Investor Day. And as a result, we are where we believe we can go with the business over the next few years remains unchanged. So for example, on the building blocks, our community is growing at some of the fastest rates we have reported more than four years. We continue to have deep penetration of hard-to-reach audiences in some of the most attractive advertising markets in the world. And we continue to have significant opportunities to expand the monetization across our screens as we just talked about. But as I said when we met last quarter, the path to getting to that longer-term ARPU opportunity in the longer-term monetization potential of the platform was never expected to be and is in a straight line. We have now delivered a two-year CAGR on top line revenue of 55%. But over that two-year period, we have had quarters where year-over-year revenue growth was as low as 17% and as high as [16%] as we navigated our way through macro headwinds, platform changes and a pandemic. So throughout all of this, we have been and we are going to continue to be focused on executing against what we believe is a really well-organized plan in order to deliver on that long-term potential that we see ahead. So hopefully, that gives you some context on how we think about this and what we see ahead."

            "name": "Jeremi Gorman",
            "content": "Thanks, Evan. In 2021, we delivered strong results amidst several challenges to our industry and demonstrated the resilience of our team and our business while investing in the future of our platform. We generated 4.1 billion in full-year revenue, an increase of 64% year-over-year, which is an acceleration of 18 percentage points over 2020. In Q4, we generated total revenue of 1.3 billion, an increase of 42% year-over-year amidst headwinds to both our direct response and brand businesses. On the direct response side, we continue to work through challenges presented by Apple's ATT related changes, and we are making solid progress. As anticipated, on the brand side, macro headwinds related to supply chain disruptions and labor disruptions materialized and remain unresolved in the new year. Despite all of this, we continue to onboard new advertisers which drove our active advertiser count to another all-time high. We remain focused on our many opportunities to support our community and advertising partners, which we believe will be driven by three key priorities. First, driving ROI through optimization and measurement; second, investing in our sales and marketing functions by continuing to train, hire and build for scale; third, building innovative ad experiences around video and augmented reality. Our unwavering commitment to these three priorities, along with our unique reach and growing global audience, allows us to drive performance at scale for businesses around the world. Our sales team is working hard to help advertisers adapt to the new measurement paradigms brought about by Apple's iOS privacy-related changes. Our advertising partners who prefer to leverage lower-funnel goals such as in-app purchases, have been most impacted by these changes. We are seeing these advertisers migrate to mid-funnel goals where they have greater visibility such as install or click. Advertisers who optimize via web-based goal-based bids or GBBs have been less impacted, given that many of them have adopted the snack pixel. Many of our advertisers have enabled both Apple's SK Ad Network or Scan as well as our own first-party measurement solutions, which we broadly refer to as Advanced Conversion, or AC. While Scan has benefits and its ability to report DDuped results across multiple platforms, AC offers our performance advertisers much more flexibility and more advanced features. We continue to improve Advanced Conversions with features such as estimated conversions, which augments observed conversion data with real-time data to help in better decision-making. Ultimately, first-party integrations allow us to build out measurement solutions based on advertiser input and directly connect to how our formats and targeting work so that businesses have the most accurate view of ROI. These allow us to preserve the privacy of our community while helping advertisers weather the disruption from platform changes. We believe it will take time to achieve broad enablement, utilization and full confidence in these measurement solutions among our advertiser base. However, we are pleased with the early progress we have made with many advertisers thus far as these new solutions are now enabled for advertisers that represent more than 75% of our direct response revenue. Right now, we are focused on helping advertisers gain confidence in these new solutions. This includes helping them perform list studies, which can take multiple weeks or more, depending on the scale of an advertiser's campaign. As mobile ad measurement moves to more holistic cross-platform views, we are seeing positive results with solutions, including media mix modeling and multi-touch attribution performed by advertisers in-house or through the wide range of measurement partners with which we are integrated. Our Direct Response business continues to account for the majority of our revenue. This positions us well for the long-term as we believe that driving measurable performance and ROI makes Snapchat an essential part of the growth strategies of businesses worldwide. Over time, we have seen strong results when advertisers test with us gained confidence in our ability to demonstrate meaningful return on ad spend, move us into their always on budget and expand our share over time. Over the years, we have partnered with Hollister to help them leverage many of our ad formats, such as Snap Ads, Lenses and Commercials, which have all proven to be effective at driving strong business results. This quarter, Hollister went a step further and began testing dynamic ads to drive conversions during the holiday period. They initially saw strong return on ad spend. And with the introduction of our new multi-format delivery solution, we were able to double Hollister's return on ad spend, while simultaneously bringing down overall CPM. Advertisers seeking to drive web-based conversions have remained relatively resilient through ATT as many had already implemented our Snap Pixel and built confidence in our first-party measurement solutions. As an example, this quarter, e-commerce fashion company, Pangaea, leveraged our pixel purchase optimization via Snacks, Story Ads and Dynamic Ads, which resulted in a 5x return on ad spend and was above their 2x target. We continue to invest in our sales and sales support teams to better service our advertising partners globally. Three years ago, in North America, we moved away from a regional sales structure and verticalized our sales team which allowed us to become hyper focused on the specific support advertisers needed in different industries. While we have been undergoing the same transformation globally due to smaller team sizes outside of North America, we have been slower to verticalize and international teams have worked without the levels of surrounding support we provided our sales team in North America. In 2021, we made substantial investments in over 10 markets outside of North America that represent a combined digital ad market of over $270 billion. At its core are three investment principles: first, we are investing in markets where Snapchat reaches more than 70% of 30 to 34-year-olds and they are a large and established digital ad markets. These are the markets where we see an opportunity to grow our share of budgets internationally over time. Second, the incremental resources will improve local and regional decision-making authority. The faster we are able to make decisions, the better we can service our advertising customers and the faster we can grow our business. Lastly, we have seen that when a region has a full stack of cross-functional resourcing, including functions like business marketing, measurement and product marketing, we are more relevant in market and can drive revenue growth more quickly. We have made a lot of progress in getting these resources in place this year and are excited about their potential to make a meaningful impact. We continue to invest heavily in our video advertising products. We partnered with the global Dentsu team on their attention economy study where Snapchat commercials were shown to be more than twice the likely to be viewed and had 6x the attentive seconds per 1,000 impressions versus the digital ad platform average. Commercials have been a popular ad format with both large brands as well as performance advertisers. For example, Cashapp ran a multi-cell brand-lift study exploring the multiproduct effect of commercials in addition to Snapads. Users exposed to Snap Ads and commercial saw a 12-point increase in brand awareness, a 13-point increase in ad awareness and a five-point increase in action intent. Augmented reality represents one of our most exciting long-term revenue opportunities. AR is unique in that it is a fully immersive and interactive experience that delivers a measurable and repeatable return on investment for advertisers. In Q4, we saw many advertisers increase their investments into AR advertising by leveraging our GBB pixel purchase optimization for AR to bring unique experiences to Snapchatters, spanning verticals like makeup, retail, streaming, food delivery, technology and e-commerce. We have invested heavily into building tools and capabilities to make it easier for advertisers to create, manage and deploy their AR experiences. For example, cosmetics company MAC utilized our self-service lens web builder tool, which is now broadly available to all beauty brands to build several AR try-on makeup lenses. The campaign ultimately drove 1.3 million try-ons, a 2.4x higher lift in brand awareness and 9x higher lift in intent and among female Snapchatters a 17x higher lift in purchases. These type of results are emblematic of a larger shift we are seeing with AR transforming e-commerce. We believe that AR represents a consumer-centric shift in how our community shops and experiences new products with virtual try-on and visualization, allowing consumers to make the leap from this looks good to this looks good on me. This leap could help lower returns and increase conversion rates for retailers. Our focus is to reduce the friction in creating and distributing AR experiences on and off Snapchat. After a successful beta program, last week, we fully rolled out our new catalog-powered shopping lenses, a completely new format built to enable shopping through the use of augmented reality. Each lens features a product card, where Snapchatters are able to see real-time information about a product name, price and description. It also gives product level insights into the performance of specific SKUs, allowing much richer feedback for the advertiser. This supports our priority of driving ROI for advertising partners as it gives them much richer signals for delivery and optimization. For example, Ulta Beauty has been activating an always-on AR approach to beta testing catalog-powered shopping lenses. This campaign generated $6 million in purchases on Snapchat and over 30 million product trends. More early adopters are seeing lenses drive significant increases in return on ad spend and conversion with this new format, and we are excited to invest in this for 2022. We demonstrated the resilience of our business, our team and our advertising solutions in 2021 in the face of ongoing macro challenges and changes in the digital advertising industry. These challenges are not behind us, but we are increasingly confident in our ability to navigate them. We have a large and engaged audience, and we remain focused on supporting our advertising partners by driving ROI through optimization and measurement investing in our sales and marketing functions and building innovative ad experiences around video and augmented reality. We are confident in our long-term trajectory and excited to execute against our priorities in 2022. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Derek. Thank you for the question. This is Jeremi. You are right, that we expect that it could take at least a couple more quarters for our advertising partners to calibrate to the instrument solutions against the results that they see in their businesses. They are utilizing litany of different triangulation tactics right now, including lift studies, AV studies and these kinds of things. And so we do expect it to take some time for them to build full confidence in these new tools. But with that being said, we are certainly pleased with the progress that we have made with our advertising partners in Q4. Advertisers that represent more than 75% of our DR revenue have now enabled our first-party measurement solutions and can use these tools alongside the third-party measurement solutions I just mentioned to optimize and measure their campaigns I think it is important to think of it as sort of a three-step journey. So first, advertisers need to enable, which makes it possible to use the tools, then they need to actively use them and then they need to build the trust and the confidence in these tools before there is broad adoption across the board. While we expect the changes to continue to impact our business and we anticipate there could be additional platform changes ahead, we remain confident in the long-term growth prospects from our Direct Response advertising business, as you have heard, and our ability to deliver results for our advertising partners in a privacy safe environment, which is increasingly important. Our teams are really focused on helping advertisers adopt our first-party solution. We have talked about that a bit, which is Advanced Conversions. And just to reiterate what that is, Advanced Conversions utilizes cryptographic techniques to measure aggregate conversion data. And it doesn't directly connect off-platform activities such app install or visiting a website back to specific Snapchatters. We are leveraging data privacy safe data processing pipelines and techniques as cohorting to match impression data provided by the advertiser. And we continue to improve that Advanced Conversions with features such as estimated conversions, which augments observed conversion data with real-time data to help in -- our advertisers make better decisions with their advertising dollars. And so we are really focused on helping advertisers adopt those solutions. And then to answer your second question regarding new advertiser growth contribution and how we think about that, as mentioned in our prepared remarks, Q4 saw active advertisers reach another all-time high. And we don't give guidance on the number of active advertisers. It is certainly our goal as part of the advertising demand flywheel to continue to grow the number of active advertisers on our platform. The more selection that we have of ads from which to choose for every impression, the more relevant, that impression can be to the Snapchatter and the focus on optimization and measurement continues to ensure that the Snapchatters are seeing the most relevant as for them and then subsequently, better conversion rates. And so over the course of 2021, we have beta tested several products to bring even more advertisers onboard and grow their business on Snapchat organically, which include public profile for businesses, and we are rolling that out more broadly. And then, of course, AR shopping lenses, which we talked about it and businesses can create and experiment those outside of advertising. And we are really excited about all of these in 2022 and beyond. Thanks for the question. And I can take the second part, Rich. Thank you very much for the question. You talked about restaurants as well as CPG and the reality is that we haven't seen a lot of change in those particular areas, the supply labor disruptions did materialize as expected, and they still remain unsolved in the new year and result in new year. But I think that when you look at the revenue and you kind of break it down, excluding the restaurant and CPG sectors, revenue from our brand advertising business grew at give or take 49% year-over-year and that indicates what we believe to be continued strong underlying momentum in our areas not impacted by supply chain and labor issues noted earlier. We expect this to continue these macro conditions that continue to impact advertising demand as, in many cases, just practically speaking, their businesses don't have the inventory or operational capacity to support incremental demand brought on by marketing. But in addition, we have plenty of categories, particularly with brands that aren't as reliant on supply chain. We have redeployed resources to many of those verticals, and they continue to perform well. Examples of that are travel, streaming, financial services amongst others. And it is really great that we have been able to develop these nimble and agile teams and support them and train them on categories that may not be their core competency to ensure that we can take advantage of the tailwind categories and shift some things away from the headwind categories, but it is really important for us to continue to support the categories that may be facing some headwinds as they are long-term. Absolutely our partners and we continue to invest in them, learn with them, grow with them and pivot our resources accordingly to make sure we can take advantage of areas where there are tailwinds. But thank you for the question. Thank you so much for the question. I'm very happy that you asked it. We certainly believe that the camera and augmented reality represent our most exciting long-term revenue opportunity. And we are seeing that with brands, they are starting to build ways on AR strategies for their businesses, and we are delivering results against that. I think the great thing about augmented reality is that it is a fully immersive experience that Snapchatters choose to engage with versus something that is passive or served to them and it is now delivering a return on investments businesses that is both measurable and repeatable. So to your point, that is something that is incredibly important for direct response advertisers. And that is encouraging more and more businesses to invest in augmented reality. You are right that when we initially launched AR for advertisers, it was kind of seen as this next shiny thing, a big brand moment, something that was a little bit more fun in their reference. But over time, we have been evolving the way that businesses think about it as more than just an ad format, but an experience that brands can build to grow their businesses. We have invested really heavily into building the tools and capabilities to make it easier to create augmented reality, which then allows it to be a part of people always on ecosystems to manage those, deploy their AR experiences. And you heard in the prepared remarks, us talk about results from the likes of MAC and Ulta, who are starting to see just incredible results with at 1.3 million try-ons, for example, on the MAC lens that was using our lens web builder tool, I think, is the best example of that. And when advertisers start to see results like that, you can imagine it is highly retentive and look alike advertisers want to start doing a lot of the same work so that they can get cost per try on down, utilizing augmented reality. These types of results that we are seeing from those two particular companies are emblematic of a larger shift that we are seeing with AR transforming e-commerce. And e-commerce is obviously a secular trend. They like to continue to grow, and we will grow right alongside it with AR as these consumer-centric ships continue to happen. And we are really excited about the future of augmented reality as a product, particularly as it delivers results for incredible advertisers with great measurement solutions."

            "name": "Evan Spiegel",
            "content": "Thank you for joining our call. The fourth quarter marked the end of an exciting and productive year for Snap. We grew our community, expanded our product offerings and demonstrated the power of our augmented reality platform, both inside and outside of the Snapchat application. We faced some fresh challenges in 2021, but posted strong results, reflecting substantial progress on our journey to sustainable growth and positive cash flow generation. We grew revenue 64% year-over-year in 2021, including 42% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. We achieved adjusted EBITDA profitability for the second consecutive year. We recorded our first full-year of positive free cash flow and Q4 marked our first quarter of positive net income. Achieving positive free cash flow for the full year is an important milestone as increasingly able to self-fund our investments in the future, which positions us well to accelerate our vision for computing overlaid on the world through augmented reality. In Q4, our community grew by 20% year-over-year to 319 million daily active users. We grew sequentially in each of our three regions. While North America and Europe represent our largest monetization opportunities in the near and medium term, Rest of World represents our largest community growth opportunity. We have made a concerted effort over the past year to organize our team and make investments in our products to realize these monetization and community growth opportunities. Our expansion efforts in India continue to prove successful, and we are using our learnings to inform how we approach community growth in new geographies. Our desire to build a better way of communicating visually through our camera has evolved into a leading platform for augmented reality. Our AR products and services are driving major impact at scale today as Snapchatters use our services to shop, play, learn, explore and entertain themselves. Over 200 million people engage with augmented reality on Snapchat every day, and our community now plays with AR Lenses an average of more than six billion times per day. This momentum and the creative energy of the Snapchat community makes us incredibly excited about the future of augmented reality. At our Lens Fest AR developer event in December, we gave an update on the strength and diversity of our AR developer community, which continues to grow. There are now over 250,000 lens creators from more than 200 countries and territories who use one studio to build AR experiences. They have made more than 2.5 million lenses that have been viewed by Snapchatters now more than 3.5 trillion times and over 300 creators have each reached more than one billion views of their lenses as Snapchatters explore new AR experiences to enhance what they see and do in their daily life, we will continue to develop tools to empower Lens creators to push the boundaries of what is possible through the Snapchat camera. At Lense Fest, we also shared the ways that we are supporting creators and evolving the tools they use to build for our platform. We introduced a lens call to action feature that lets creators include a link within a lens, making it easy to drive Snapchatters to a new destination like a shop from within the AR experience. We have made a catalog of licensed music and audio clips available to integrate into lenses so that creators can build more immersive experiences. We rolled out our gifting feature, which lets Snapchatters directly support Lens creators through story replies and announced Ghost, our AR innovation lab, providing grants of up to $150,000 and Snap team support for creative AR projects. In addition to the momentum with augmented reality on Snapchat, we are very excited by the growing demand from businesses who want to bring Snap's AR capabilities into their own apps and websites. We are meeting this growing demand through Camera Kit, which enables partners to easily integrate our AR technology and create our ecosystem in ways that meet their business objectives. With their Camera Kit integration, Dress X invites users to try on and wear digital fashion in real time, supporting unique experiences that combine the physical and digital realms. Dress X has seen incredible success and engagement as 75% of their total app users engage with AR Lenses and users try on AR looks 22 times per day on average. By extending the reach of their AR lenses onto the Dress ex public profile within Snapchat, Dressx drove a 120% increase in their public profile subscriptions. This quarter, we made significant progress with our Spectacles AR glasses, the fourth generation of a product line that we first introduced more than five-years ago as a fun hands-free camera designed to help capture your perspective while staying in a moment. Hundreds of creators from 30 countries have now developed AR lenses for Spectacles, overlaying computing on the world in an immersive and interactive way. We have continued to make software improvements and offer new capabilities for developers including Connected Lenses, which link multiple Spectacles users to participate in the same AR experience together and location triggers, which lets creators customize lenses to adapt as they visit specific locations. Our content business comprises two of the five main screens of our application, Stories and Spotlight. Despite substantial competitive pressure over the years, stories remain our largest driver of revenue. It is a platform where Snapchatters share snaps with their friends in narrative form via friend stories and watch content from professional publishers and influencers in Discover. Spotlight, our newest platform, services the most entertaining snaps from our community. And we have been overwhelmed by the positive response from viewers and increasingly, creators. On our Discover platform, our content partners continue to find success. In Q4 2021, 25 different Discover partners each reached over 50 million unique Snapchatters globally. This captures a wide range of genres from Universal Music's Rebel Labs to social publisher Jungle creations lifestyle content, team whistle sports content and creator-driven shows from Jelly Smack. We are also introducing more locally relevant partners worldwide. We added more than 160 new channels in the quarter from Discover partners outside of the U.S. and onboarded new partners, including 71 Entertainment Group in Germany, and Canal+ in France. We are also investing in content from underrepresented voices through the 523 content accelerator program we launched in Q4 to support and promote small minority-owned content companies that lack access and resources relative to their larger competitors. Snap Originals are another successful element of our strategy to reflect the diversity of our community through our content. In 2021, over 50% of Snap Originals featured diverse leads or hosts. We rolled out successful new shows, including the Me and You show, which stars Snapchatters and their friends using our cameos feature and reached over 50 million viewers in Q4. In Q4 2021, the number of content viewers on Snapchat continued to grow at a significantly faster rate year-over-year than overall time spent watching content as the decline in time spent watching stories created by friends was offset by growth in time spent watching premium content in Discover as well as content in Spotlight. This is a continuation of the trend we have observed throughout the pandemic and friend story posting and viewing for daily active user have not returned to pre-pandemic levels. While we are hopeful our community will, in time, return to the friend story behaviors that we observed prior to the pandemic, we are focused on innovating on our content offerings to better serve our community today. With so many different types of content on Snapchat from friends, creators and media companies, we want to make it easier for Snapchatters to find what they want to watch when they want to watch it. We are optimistic about the results we are seeing from early experiments and look forward to rolling out more product changes this year. We also continue to make progress building out Spotlight. We have learned a lot from our creator community that will drive the evolution of the overall Snapchat content experience, including the relationship between Spotlight and Discover. Already more than 20 Spotlight creators are syndicating shows on Discover. This supports our vision of Spotlight as a platform where audiences can discover new creators, topics and communities and then engage with them more deeply on Discover. We have also been able to effectively utilize creator incentives to grow and diversify Spotlight content. In its first year, we rewarded more than 12,000 creators through a variety of programs. More recently, we have shifted our incentives to reward a broader range of content across categories and geographies. We are focused on supporting a diversity of platform-native content creation in order to build robust, sustainable content supply. In Q4, we prioritized helping creators reach new audiences, and we saw the number of Spotlight viewers subscribing to creators more than double versus the prior quarter. These efforts have also improved the viewer experience, but the number of Snapchatters favoring Spotlight snaps increasing by 20% sequentially. Since launch, we have seen our creator community grow dramatically in scale and we have been particularly encouraged by how creators are investing in the platform. Today, we see three times as many monthly posts for Creator than we did when Spotlight launched a year-ago. We created spotlight to amplify the best of Snapchat and today over 65% of spotlight submissions used one of Snapchat's AR Lenses or creative tools. We are adding utility in other areas of Snapchat as well. We have made our map even more personal by launching our first two layers, Memories and Explore, which allow users to view their safe snaps by location and explore new snaps submitted around the world. These layers have been used over 100 million times since launch. We also continue to build engagement by making places easy to discover, favorite and share with friends. Within our communications platform, we continue to add new games and minis to further promote shared experiences with friends and add additional utility for our community. Developers are finding opportunity and success with games on Snapchat. For example, we signed a deal with partner Woodoo Games to build at least 20 games for Snapchat in 2022 on the heels of five new games built in 2021. Another partner, Mojiworks, released their second hit game, Trivia party following their hit Ready Chef Go. Mojiworks has now reached nearly 100 million players across the two games. We have rolled out new use cases for minis with partners ranging from startups to established brands finding success on our platform. For example, after a successful greetings card mini Givingli recently launched a gift card e-commerce mini that enables Snapchatters to buy branded gift cards such as Sephora, DoorDash or Taco Bell and easily gift them to their friends on Snapchat. Given the enormity of the opportunity in front of us, both in terms of the Snapchat application as well as our augmented reality platform, 2022 will be a significant investment year for us as we work to accelerate our road map and deliver against our long-term vision of computing overlaid on the world. We will continue to remain focused on doing the right things to promote the safety and well-being of our community, investing in new technologies and teams to protect Snapchatters and ensure they have a positive experience with our products. The trust of our community is essential to us, and we don't take it for granted. We work every day to improve, and we are always learning how we can better support our community. I will now turn it over to Jeremi to discuss more about our business. Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. We are really excited about the long-term here in particular to what we are seeing is a lot of momentum around augmented reality today on Snapchat. So there are over 200 million people engaging with AR every day. I think people are playing with Lenses and Snapchat over six billion times, using our camera every day. And what we are doing now is taking all this technology and not only continuing to improve it for developers, but also to make it much more accessible for businesses and to help them specifically in e-commerce and retail help consumers try on their products and convert easily through our camera. So a lot of our investments in the near and medium term are really around smartphone augmented reality because we just see such a massive opportunity there. And then looking a definitely excited about the evolution of our Lens Studio developer tools and how that will support augmented reality on our Spectacles glasses in the future. We released our first version of stand-alone AR glasses last year and continuing to build on that and evolve that platform. So a lot to do on smartphone AR today in the near and medium term and then, of course, building to the long-term future of computing overlaid on the world. Thanks, Rich, for the question. I can talk a little bit about engagement. I think we have worked really hard over the years to diversify our product offering beyond just communicating with friends and family, into Stories, of course, in our Map and now with Spotlight. And I think what we are seeing with the growth of our user base overall is that people are coming to Snap for all sorts of different reasons and then migrating across our different products. So while we certainly compete with TikTok and Instagram and YouTube for video entertainment, we also have different areas of our service like our Map or our AR platform where we see a really strong engagement. And I think as it pertains to stories in particular and growth in video, I talked a little bit following on some of our prior earnings calls about the trends we are seeing throughout the pandemic, where we are seeing people post fewer stories for their friends, view fewer stories from their friends. But at the same time, we have seen folks watching more premium content, watching more content Spotlight. So there is a bit of a mix shift there. Some of our user studies, for example, when we talk to our community, they say, gosh, during the pandemic, I haven't been able to do as many cool things out with my friends. So I'm posting less stories or stories are less interesting because my friends aren't doing as many cool things. So we will have to see how that progresses. Obviously, the Omicron thing was a little bit of a setback there for us. But overall, the core of Snapchat is really about friends and family. And I think we offer a really differentiated product, not only with stories and some of our entertainment products, but across our entire service in all of our different platforms. On the first part of the question, I believe, in terms of net adds you are thinking about specifically DAU in that area and our growth in that sector. So one, I think we laid out at our Investor Day a little over a year ago, our international playbook and investments that we plan to make in order to grow the community globally. We have continued to execute against that plan over the last year, including significant investments in local content, local marketing partnerships and building our local creator community, and we continue to execute against that plan and seen strong results as a result of that. In particular, I would note that this was our fifth consecutive quarter of 20% better year-over-year growth, including 54 million total DAU. So good momentum on the community base there. We are going to continue to execute against that playbook and invest in our platform and our products in order to support the growth of our community over time. So hopefully, that gives a little perspective about what we are seeing there."

This quarter we celebrated Snap's 10-year anniversary, and as we reflect on the progress we've made over the past decade, we have never been more excited about our future. Bobby and I grew up with social media and we wanted to build something different, a way for people to have fun and express themselves without the permanence and pressure of public likes and comments. We built a camera to make it easier for people to communicate with close friends and family and express themselves visually. And today we reach more than 500 million people, including more than 75% of 13 to 34 year - old\u2019s in the U.S, Canada, France, the UK, Australia, and the Netherlands. We have innovated on top of our camera and build augmented reality, content, and mapping platforms that each reach hundreds of millions of people. We are now operating our advertising business at scale, providing us with the resources we need to invest in our long-term vision of computing overlaid on the world through our camera. And we are just getting started. This quarter, we grew daily active users to 306 million, marking our fourth consecutive quarter of more than 20% year-over-year growth. We grew sequentially in North America and Europe, which represent our largest monetization opportunities in the near and medium-term, and we continue to build on our momentum in the rest of world geographies, where we see massive long-term potential. Our DAU and rest-of-world represents just 5% of the overall rest-of-world smartphone population, which is currently more than 2 billion people and growing. Many of the mixed engagement trends we observed during the pandemic and that we discussed on our last earnings call have continued through the third quarter. On one hand, while total content viewership and time spend has grown year-over-year, user-generated stories continue to see year-over-year declines in overall time spend. On the other hand, we are seeing quarter-over-quarter improvements in engagement with the Snap map, story, posting, new friend connections, and bi-directional communication. And we're cautiously optimistic about the ongoing reductions in pandemic-related restrictions worldwide. We grew our revenue 57% year-over-year to reach $1.067 billion, delivering adjusted EBITDA of $174 million and $52 million of free cash flow. While we are excited about the continuing growth of our business and improvement in our cost structure, we missed the lower end of our guidance by $3 million due to a few key factors, including changes to advertising tracking on iOS and macroeconomic factors that have impacted our advertising partners. Our advertising business was disrupted by changes to iOS ad tracking that were broadly rolled out by Apple in June and July. While we anticipated some degree of business disruption, the new Apple provided measurement solution to not scale as we had expected, making it more difficult for our advertising partners to measure and manage their ad campaign for IOS. We have remained very focused on driving ROI for our advertising partners, and we continue to see strong consistent performance on our ad platform, based on first-party data and conversion lift studies, and are working on building flexible first-party tooling and measurement solutions to serve the diverse needs of our advertising partners. This impact was compounded by the ongoing macroeconomic effects of the global pandemic with our advertising partners facing a variety of supply chain interruptions and labor shortages. This, in turn, reduces their short-term appetite to generate additional customer demand through advertising at a time when their businesses are already supply constrained. The ongoing magnitude and duration of these global supply and labor disruptions are inherently unpredictable. In the meantime, we are focused on supporting our partners in this uncertain environment. While it is difficult to predict the trajectory of these challenges, the growth of our audience, the adoption of our new products and platforms by our community, and the underlying efficacy of our advertising products for performance advertisers gives us confidence in the future of our business and our ability to navigate this environment as we continue to invest in our long-term vision. Augmented reality is one of our most exciting long-term opportunities, because it is simultaneously very early in its technological development and already used by hundreds of millions of people. More than 200 million people engage with AR every day on Snapchat across a variety of use cases including entertainment, fashion, education, and the arts. This quarter, we partnered with Sign All to introduce three AR lenses teaching Snap chatters how to finger spell in American sign language. We featured a number of community trial lenses to celebrate Fashion Week. And we partnered with Sotheby's to allow Snap chatters to experience Christo and Jeanne-Claude's artistic rendition of the Arc de Triomphe from anywhere in the world. We are also doubling down on the early successes we have seen helping people try on clothing, beauty products, and accessories with augmented reality, and are working closely with partners like Ralph Lauren, MAC Cosmetics, and Zenni Optical to expand our AR shopping experiences on today's smartphones. In the longer term, we are investing in new ways people can interact with the physical world around them, including using our, our AR-enabled spectacles. We're thrilled to see the unique experiences our creator community has developed for this new form factor, as we iterate on our long-term hardware products roadmap. Our content partners continue to find success on our platform with 15 different partners, each reaching over 50 million Snap chatters this quarter. Two of our new Snap originals launched this quarter, mean mom and Honestly Lauren, and each reached over 10 million viewers. We are also introducing more locally relevant content as our community grows worldwide. In France, we partnered with M6, our first major French broadcast partner for entertainment content, to bring 400 episodes of their TV shows to Snapchat. In Mena, we partnered with ITP Media Group to bring more than 200 show episodes from some of the region\u2019s biggest and most influential creators. We are very excited about the long-term potential of Spotlight, our newest platform designed to shine a light on the best snaps created by our community. In recent months, we have focused on building the tools and infrastructure to help creators of all kinds thrive on Spotlight. We have re-engineered the spotlight incentive programs to reach more creators who are publishing a greater diversity of content in more markets. We are committed to making Spotlight a platform on which professional creators can grow an audience and build a business, and both gifting and the creator marketplace for Spotlight are now live. We are extremely pleased to see daily Spotlight submissions more than double when compared to last quarter and are encouraged by ongoing quarter-over-quarter growth in both daily active users of Spotlight and daily time spent per user. We will continue to build Spotlight into a unique entertainment destination for our community and are rewarding creative outlet for people expressing themselves through our camera. We are also continuing to innovate and improve our products for both our community and our partners. We launched the Places tray, which allows the 250 million Snap chatters that use the Snap Map each month to save their favorite locations and explore what places are popular among their friends. We expanded our minis offerings to include our first CoWatching experience with HBO Max, as well as a new birthday mini to provide reminders for friends' birthdays. Our new Run for Office mini, which helps young people run for local office, encouraged more than 2 million Snap chatters to explore local election opportunities, and more than 45,000 people have nominated a friend to run for office. Profiles now support next-generation 3D bitmoji, letting people express themselves through a variety of options for backgrounds, poses, and facial expressions. As we reflect on the past decade, we are fortunate to have grown our business in a favorable economic, regulatory, and geopolitical environment. We prioritize growing our business responsibly and sustainably, rather than scaling as fast as possible. And our commitment to privacy and empowering self-expression through our camera, led us to build our products in a way that we believe enables our future success over the long term. As we look to the future, these fundamental decisions, along with the scale we have already achieved in our business and operations, gives us confidence that we have the resilience to maintain our momentum through a changing macro environment. Now I will turn the call over to Jeremy to share more about our business.\nJeremi Gorman : Thanks, Evan. In Q3, we generated total revenue of $1.067 billion, an increase of 57% year-over-year, as we grappled with industry changes to the way advertising is targeted, optimized, and measured on iOS that created a more significant impact on our business than we had expected. Despite these challenges, we crossed 1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time, and we remain focused on our long-term opportunity to support our community and advertising partners, which we believe will be driven by three key priorities. First, driving ROI through measurement, ranking, and optimization. Second, investing in our sales and marketing functions by continuing to train, hire, and build for scale. Third, building innovative ad experiences around video and augmented reality with a focus on commerce. Additionally, we reach a valuable and hard-to-find audience, which continues to grow around the world. Together, we believe that over the long term, these factors will allow us to drive performance at scale for businesses around the world. We are continuing to work through the ongoing changes to digital advertising driven by Apple's App tracking transparency framework, which was introduced as part of IOS 14.5. We saw meaningful adoption in June and July, when Apple pushed all of its users to update to the new version of iOS  speaking, these changes have upended many of the industry norms and advertiser behaviors that were built on IDFA, Apple's unique device identifier for advertising, over the past decade, which now require a double opt-in by users in order to access directly. As part of these changes, Apple rolled out SKAdNetwork or SKAN as a proprietary solution to allow app-based advertisers to continue measuring their advertising on iOS. The initial results we observed using SKAN were generally aligned with prior industry standard solutions. And we were among the first platforms to lean into this solution and push for widespread industry adoption. However, over time, we saw SKAN measurement results diverged meaningfully from the results we observed on other first and third-party measurement solutions. Thinking scan unreliable of a standalone measurement solution. Furthermore, as our advertising partners have explored and tested SKAN solutions, they have serviced a variety of concerns about its limitations. Every advertiser has their own unique, fine-tuned perspective on their optimal parameters to measure ROI for their business. but SKAN requires them to use Apple's fixed definitions of advertiser success. For example, advertisers are no longer able to understand the impact of their unique campaigns based on things like time between viewing an ad and taking an action, or the time spent viewing an ad. Additionally, real-time campaign and creative management is hindered by extended reporting delays and advertisers are unable to target advertising based on whether or not people have already installed their app. As a result, we have accelerated our focus on developing additional first-party privacy safe solutions to help our advertising partners measure their campaigns effectively. Our primarily solution is advanced conversions, which work seamlessly with our mobile measurement partners, and uses aggregated privacy safe methodologies to help advertisers understand the impact of Snapchat and their media mix. This solution is now launched for all eligible advertisers and we are encouraged by the early adoption we're seeing from apps. Even with a basic feature set, we have approximately 50% of app advertisers opting in via their media measurement partner or direct integrations. We are excited to invest in both third-party and first-party solutions to provide a richer set of privacy-safe tools to our partners to help them measure and optimize their advertising. We otherwise continue to see strong sustained performance in our app advertising platform as measured by both first-party engagement data and incremental Lift studies, and believe the long-term shift towards privacy-safe solutions will be a net benefit to our community and our business. We are working closely with our advertising partners to help them grow their businesses with our large engaged audience. This work will not only address the near-term disruptions driven by ATT, but it will also help our partners adapt for the long-term, privacy-oriented future. Over the last couple of years, our direct response business has grown at a faster rate than our brand business. This is something of which we are incredibly proud and continue to feel is the right strategy for the long-term. Proving performance and delivering ROI are our top priorities, and we've made significant progress over the past several years. As we've mentioned, for the past few quarters, DR has grown to comprise over 50% of our business. While this has been a historic strength, given the recent ATT changes coupled with Snapchat's existence as a mobile-only platform, our strengthened DR has become a more significant headwind in the current environment. However, we still believe that in time, every advertiser will be a performance advertiser. And despite the recent shake up in the ecosystem, driving DR performance is the right strategy over the long term. Separate from these iOS related issues, we've heard from advertising partners across a wide variety of industries and geographies that they are facing headwinds in their business related to disruptions in global supply chains, as well as labor shortages and increasing costs. In turn, we expect this to impact advertising demand in Q4 in particular, as in many cases, their businesses do not have the inventory or operational capacity to support incremental demand. We expect that some of these clients may opt to slow their marketing spend given the diminished need to drive incremental demand at a time when their supply chains are not able to operate at peak capacity. We continue to invest in our sales teams and marketing initiatives in order to support our advertising partners and achieve our long-term revenue and ARPU goals. For example, this quarter, our marketing team launched the Open Your Snapchat campaign, which invites both customers and advertisers to fully dive into Augmented Reality, unlocking hundreds of custom experiences localized to several different markets across the globe. The campaign highlights many of our e-commerce advertiser and B2B relationships. This week, we rolled out a new ad experience lining the walkway of the Westfield Bridge in London, which feature lenses with brands including American Eagle, Ralph Lauren, and the Jordan brand. While still in early days, we have already seen positive signs of the campaign's success, including lists and consideration, and trust among our 25 to 34-year-old audience. The team also launched Snapchat Trends in the quarter, a self-service tool which allows our advertising partners to discover and explore trends across Snapchat, so they can find what topics perform well on Snapchat and better engage with our community. We continue to invest heavily in professional content and video advertising to support our community and advertising partners. For example, we partnered with Hollister to seamlessly integrate custom ads within our new Snap original, Lago Vista. Each episode included three commercials featuring one of the series' cast members sporting Hollister gear. And a third commercial introduced a new, custom, Hollister -branded Augmented Reality lens which included prompts that Snap chatters could tap to visit the Hollister website. The entire ad experience focused on creating cohesive branding with our Snap original content, which led to strong view rates and share rates. We believe that Camera and Augmented Reality represents our most exciting long-term revenue opportunity, particularly as brands start to build always-on AR strategies for their business. Augmented reality advertising is a fully immersive experience that is delivering a return on investment for advertisers, that is measurable and repeatable, which is encouraging more and more businesses to invest in AR. For example, Ultra Beauty leveraged our GBB pixel purchase optimization for AR to bring unique makeup try-on experiences to Snap chatters, which drove over a 4.5 times higher return on ad spend compared to its campaign optimized for impression. The success of the try-on lens ultimately encouraged Ultra Beauty to include AR lenses within its long-term business strategy. We have continued to roll-out a number of tools and capabilities to help empower AR commerce on Snapchat. Not only can our AR try-on technology drive higher return on ad spend for businesses. But it can also deliver a huge uplift for brands, because Snap chatters can visualize what they look like wearing different products. For example, Samsung Watch 3 adopted our AR try-on lens in the U.K. to drive product awareness for its latest wearable technology. The campaign delivered impressive Brand Lift measurement results, including a 23-point lift in product awareness driven by those exposed to the lens. Now, businesses of all sizes are beginning to invest in their own public profile, which gives them a free permanent home on Snapchat, where they can showcase compelling AR experiences and share shoppable products directly within the app. The Department of Culture and Tourism, Abu Dhabi launched its first official public profile in Q3, which aims to give potential visitors a chance to discover what the UAE's capital has to offer. The new profile has already driven incremental engagement with Snap chatters. The stories format highlights the destination's many offerings, and the AR experiences are an immersive way to explore Abu Dhabi virtually. One of our top priorities for AR is reducing the barrier to creation and helping brands understand the importance of AR and the value it can drive. One of the ways in which we are improving this is through our recent acquisition of Vertebrae, a platform that enables brands and retailers to develop 3D AR assets. Vertebrae's team and technology will further our AR apparel and 3D asset roadmap by providing the backend platform to create, manage, and deploy AR assets. We are offering 3D asset creation as a service to help businesses create AR content at scale and drive business results. This platform will also make it even easier for brands to activate AR shopping experiences on Snapchat. Additionally, we announced a new partnership that will give WPP and its clients more access to Snaps AR technology and resources, including classes on how to use AR, creative production and campaign measurement. We also just announced the launch of our new global creative studio for branded AR called Arcadia. Powered by the team of world-class experts that pioneered mobile AR advertising, Arcadia will develop new technology and deliver the most innovative, impactful, and effective AR experiences to brand in agency partner. Arcadia will be platform-agnostic and develop experiences that can live across different platforms, including the web and app-based AR environment. Lastly, when brands use a portfolio approach of combining sponsored AR lenses with Snap Ads, they result in higher ROI and lower cost per outcome. For example,  spiral campaign utilizing Snap Ads, Story Ads, and a lens to generate double-digit lifts in brand awareness and ad awareness. And 9-point lift in watch intent. When Snap chatters were exposed to multiple products, brand-awareness and watch intent increased by two times and three times respectively, ultimately reinforcing the value of leveraging our different ad formats together to drive performance and ROI. In summary, we are working very closely with our advertising partners to build and adapt for the future. While there will be near-term monetization challenges related to our direct response business and the macroeconomic environment, we ultimately believe that the best way to retain and build relationships with advertisers, is to continuously they deliver measurable ROI. We will continue to invest for the long term and making product and marketplace improvements to help advertisers scale, build focused relationships with brands and agencies across verticals, and improve our direct response products and measurement solutions for performance centric businesses. Based on the size of our audience, their levels of engagement across our service, and our overall opportunity in the growing digital advertising market, we are well-positioned to play an important role in driving results for businesses across the world. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Derek.\nDerek Andersen : Thanks, Jeremi. Our Q3 financial results reflect our priorities of growing our community, making focused investments in the future of our business, and scaling our operations efficiently in order to drive towards profitability and positive free cash flow. As Evan mentioned earlier, our community grew to 306 million daily active users in Q3. An increase of 57 million or 23% year-over-year. Q3 marks our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in excess of 20%. And it's tied with the prior quarter for the highest rate of growth for our community in more than four years. In North America, DAU grew by 6 million or 7% year-over-year to reach 96 million. In Europe, DAU grew by 8 million or 11% year-over-year to reach 80 million. In rest of world, DAU grew by 43 million or 49% year-over-year to reach 130 million. As we continue to execute against the international growth playbook we laid out at our Investor Day earlier this year, including investments in local language support, local content, local marketing partnerships, and support for local creator communities. Total revenue for Q3 was one billion, sixty-seven million, an increase of 57% year-over-year. This was 3 million below our guidance range entering the quarter, which primarily reflect headwinds associated with iOS platform policy changes. Direct response advertising has comprised the majority of our business for some time now, and has also been growing at relatively higher rates in recent quarters due to the impact of changes in the iOS ecosystem that affect optimization and measurement of direct response advertising objectives. The revenue from this portion of  Business was approximately flat quarter-over-quarter. Our brand focused advertising business was the primary driver of sequential growth in Q3, and remained healthiest in North America during the quarter. In North America, our revenue grew 60% year-over-year in Q3. while ARPU grew 49% year-over-year, as we continue to benefit from the significant investments we made in our sales teams and sales support in the prior year. In Europe, revenue grew 49% year-over-year in Q3, While ARPU grew 34% year-over-year. In rest of world, revenue grew 53% year-over-year in Q3, while ARPU grew 3% year-over-year. As we've indicated in the past, we are continuing to accelerate our investments in sales and sales support beyond North America in order to capture our global ARPU opportunity fast er in the years ahead. Given the rapid growth of our community and rest-of-world and the relatively early stage of our investments in sales and sales support in this region, rest-of-world ARPU is best considered as an output metric at this stage. Average ECPM increased 62% year-over-year in Q3. Rising ECPM relative to the prior year reflects the year-over-year rise in overall demand, a mix shift towards relatively higher ECPM products, as well as a mix shift towards relatively higher ECPM regions such as North America. In addition, we have observed sequential and year-over-year increases in the cost -per-action for our goal-based bidding products, which we attribute to the loss of signals that our advertising partners had previously relied on to measure the impact of their campaigns. Adoption of our new measurement solutions, such as advanced conversions is ongoing but will take time to be fully adopted. In addition, the ecosystem for measuring advertising returns is continuing to shift, with more changes anticipated as part of IOS 15, that are expected to further reduce the availability of certain signals that are currently used broadly as tools for optimization and measurement. Continuing to evolve and adapt our measurement solutions amid the rapidly shifting operating environment is a top priority as we seek to deliver attractive returns on advertising spent for our advertising partners over the long term. The ongoing growth of our community, and strong engagement in areas of our application that we have not yet begun to monetize, provide confidence in the value of our inventory and platform over the long-term, as we continue to navigate these changes. Gross margins were 60% in Q3, an increase of approximately two percentage points year-over-year and four percentage points sequentially, which brings us to the 60% medium-term goal we noted at our Investor Day, much sooner than anticipated. Gross margins may occasionally be volatile as we make investments in the long-term growth of our business as demonstrated by our investments in Spotlight. But we continue to deliver against our goal of driving down our underlying infrastructure unit costs over time to achieve long-term margin expansion. Infrastructure costs per DAU was $0.66 in Q3, down from $0.70 in the prior year. But up from a record low as a public Company of $0.62 in the prior quarter. The sequential rise in this metric reflects investments in machine learning to support our direct response advertising business and spotlight content optimization, as well as investments in support of our overall community growth. On the content side, we continue to invest in spotlight, and this contributed to year-over-year growth in cost of revenue. But the level of investment declined sequentially, reflecting a full quarter of the new structure for this program to promote more content diversity across categories and regions. We continue to be highly encouraged by the early returns from our investments in Spotlight with daily Spotlight submissions more than doubling compared to the prior quarter, and ongoing quarter-over-quarter growth in both daily active users of Spotlight and daily time spent per user. While it is still very early for this new platform, we are excited about the potential for Spotlight to further expand our monetization opportunity in the future. We are particularly pleased that we have been able to continue to invest in Spotlight and Discover while expanding our gross margins year-over-year, which reflects our overall approach of scaling our operations efficiently while making investments in the future of our business. Operating expenses were 464 million in Q3, up 37% year-over-year. As expected, our rate of hiring stepped up in Q3. Total employee-related costs were up 31% year-over-year, driven by a 40% increase in full-time headcount. This reflects ongoing investments in our team, as well as the integration of acquisitions made over the past year, which contributed approximately 10% points of the year-over-year growth in full-time headcount. In addition, we increased our investments in marketing, both sequentially and year-over-year with the launch of the Open Your Snapchat campaign in Q3. Lastly, certain costs that were significantly diminished due to the pandemic-related restrictions in the prior year, including travel and event-related costs, are gradually returning to our cost structure and contributed in part to the year-over-year growth rate of operating expenses. Adjusted EBITDA was 174 million in Q3, an improvement of 118 million year-over-year as we continued to grow our top-line rapidly while scaling our cost structure efficiently. We delivered adjusted EBITDA leverage of 30% in Q3 as we continue to invest in the future of our business while making progress towards sustained profitability and positive free cash flow. Net income was negative 72 million in Q3, an improvement of 128 million over the prior year, which reflects the flow-through of the $118 million improvement in adjusted EBITDA, as well as 122 million higher gains on investments in the quarter. This was partially offset by 120 million higher stock-based compensation. While headcount growth is the largest driver of this expense, accounting for more than 60% of the year-over-year increase, the impact of long-term retention associated with several acquisitions completed in the last year and the impact of higher payroll-related taxes, due to our higher stock price, were also significant drivers of the year-over-year increase. While we have continued to grow our team and leveraged stock-based compensation strategically to foster an ownership culture and drive long-term retention. We have remained focused on managing these programs, responsible. Total, fully Diluted shares outstanding grew 4.6% year-over-year in Q3. A significant portion of this year-over-year growth was driven by 1.1 billion of early conversions of our outstanding convertible notes, that were completed in Q2 and Q3 of 2021. Excluding dilution related to convertible notes, the rate of growth and fully diluted shares outstanding was just 1.3% year-over-year, down from 1.7% in the prior quarter, and well below the 3% estimate we shared during our recent Investor Day that was noted to be exclusive of any dilution related to convertible notes. Free cash flow for Q3 was positive 52 million, or $121 million improvement versus the prior year, driven primarily by the improvement in adjusted EBITDA noted earlier. We ended the quarter with 3.5 billion in cash and marketable securities up from 2.7 billion in the prior year as the proceeds and convertible notes issued over the past year more than offset the investments we have made to grow the business over the same period. As a result of the early conversion of our convertible notes, mentioned earlier, we have been able to build our cash position to fund long-term investments, while maintaining a responsible level of overall debt of 2.3 billion in Q3, which is approximately flat year-over-year on an apple-to-apples basis after adjusting for the impact of adopting the new accounting standard for convertible notes. This reflects our approach of managing our balance sheet conservatively and responsibly to support the long-term growth of our business. Q3 marks our second quarter of positive Free Cash Flow. And we are also Free Cash Flow positive on a year-to-date basis, which marks an important milestone for our Company as we transition towards self-funding our investments and the future of our business. The progress we have made in expanding our growth margins, and balancing our investments in operating costs as we scale our business, have enabled us to drive 34% of incremental revenue to the adjusted EBITDA  over the trailing 12 months. Which demonstrates the potential for our business to deliver substantial free cash flow generation as we scale our top-line overtime. As we look forward to Q4, we faced a variety of challenges in the operating environment, including the iOS platform changes, as well as macro uncertainty driven by supply chain disruption and labor shortages. The fact that these challenges are largely exogenous, makes the provision of guidance particularly challenging and complex. We expect that the measurement and optimization foundations of the digital advertising economy will continue to experience significant changes in the months ahead, including additional disruptions we expect related to the adoption of iOS 15. We are focused on helping our partners navigate these changes, but we still expect these headwinds to continue to impact our business throughout Q4, as the adoption of new measurement solutions will take time. It is still not clear what the longer-term impact of the iOS platform changes may be. And this may not be clear until at least several months or more after the ecosystem stabilizes and advertisers are able to fully implement the new solutions we are developing. In addition, we are hearing from advertising partners across a wide variety of industries that they are facing disruptions in their supply chains, as well as labor shortages. Unfortunately, these changes are occurring during a season when our advertising partners would normally expect our supply chains to be operating at peak capacity, and at a time when we would otherwise expect peak advertising demand to drive peak contestation and therefore peak pricing in our auction. While it is difficult to predict the duration and magnitude of these macroeconomic factors on the businesses of our partners, we have assumed that these headwinds will persist throughout Q4. When combined with the measurement-related headwinds we are seeing in our direct response business, we expect a compounding impact on the level of contestation and pricing in our auction-based ecosystem, relative to what we would otherwise expect during the second half of Q4 in particular. We currently estimate the DAU will be 316 million to 318 million in Q4, implying year-over-year growth of 19% to 20%. On the monetization side, we currently estimate Q4 revenue will be between 1.165 billion and 1.205 billion implying year-over-year growth of between 28% and 32% in Q4. On the expense side in Q4, we intend to continue to invest in our teams and products to support the long-term growth of our business in order to build on the momentum we have established with our community and our partners. Our estimates for Q4 adjusted EBITDA reflect our revenue guidance and our expected level of investment, resulting in a range of 135 million to 175 million for Q4. Thank you for joining our call today, and we will now take your questions.\nOperator: That concludes the prepared remarks for today's earnings call. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. . At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. The first question comes from Rich Greenfield with LightShed Partners, please go ahead.\nRichard Greenfield : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Evan, as you think about it, we've assumed that you'd be growing 60% plus in Q4 revenues, if not for, I guess, Apple and these supply chain issues. Obviously, I know you can't really comment on or solve the supply chain issues, but, I guess, as we think about the Issues going on with Apple, is getting back to a normal or getting back to normal, is it a quarter away, quarters away, years? And then, I think back in March, just related to this, I think at March at an investor conference, you talked about your confidence in growing 50% in terms of multi-year revenue growth rate. How confident are you, you get back to that, again, whether it's quarter, quarters or years?\nEvan Spiegel : Hey Rich. Thanks so much for the question and share your disappointment. This has definitely been a frustrating setback for us. But I think over the long term these privacy changes and protecting privacy for users of IOS and of course, the Snapchat community, is really important to the long-term health of the ecosystem and something that we fully support. I think when we saw these changes coming, our primary focus was the performance of our advertising platform in the face of this signal law. So, could we still really drive advertising performance, optimize campaigns, make sure our adds were in front of the right people. And we spent the vast majority of our engineering time and effort and energy, making sure our ads were still really effective. And we did all sorts of revenue back testing to make sure that we could be revenue neutral. We were really confident in our ability to drive results with our advertising platform despite the signal loss. But what I think we really underestimated where the tooling changes. And so, what I mean by that specifically is that, advertisers have essentially for a long time now. use a set of really sophisticated tools to measure and optimize their campaign. So that allows them to test out a bunch of different creative and see what's performing more effectively and so on and so forth. And the big change there was that with these new Apple changes, those tools were essentially rendered blind, and in their place, Apple released a new product called SKAdNetwork that allows advertisers to measure across different advertising platforms but without a lot of the flexibility that they're used to. For example, you can only really measure your advertising results using the success parameters that Apple's already defined. The reporting is delayed for a significant period of time and often unavailable if you don't hit a certain threshold of conversions. It's very hard to see performance on a creative level. But of course, it does have the benefit of being able to look across different advertising platforms. So, what we've done is built our own solution called Advanced Conversions that allows people to do much more sophisticated things and really get the benefits of a lot of flexibility using the advanced conversions product so they can understand performance at the creative level, optimize for down funnel conversions and things like that. And we've been working really hard to make that solution more effective and help advertisers onboard. But the obvious challenge with advanced conversions is that it only has Snapchat first-party data, it doesn't have the benefit of looking across all of the other advertising platforms. So what advertisers essentially have to do is use both of those tools,  ad network and advanced conversions. And the way that they're able to understand the performance of both is by running incrementality testing for example, that shows you how performing your advertising is on different platforms. And that process, adopting A  network, adopting advanced conversions, running incrementality testing, and really building trust in these new solutions after the tooling you've been using for a decade has essentially gone away. That just takes time and is really challenging. So, we definitely underestimated that impact. We're advertising partners, we're working through it. We've certainly seen some early signs of success. But it's going to take a little while. I think the good thing is that we remain very confident in the underlying performance of our advertising products. And when we look at incrementality testing, when we look at first-party data like on platform swipes or installs, things like that, we see that those conversions are still happening at similar rates that they did in the past. So, I think we can work through the tooling issues; it will take time because they're new. But the underlying performance of the advertising platform is still very strong.\nDerek Andersen : Hey, Rich, it's Derek speaking. I will take the second half of your question as it pertains to long-term growth opportunity of the business. The first thing I'd share here is that we believe the fundamentals of our business are intact and we remain confident in the long-term growth potential of the business. We believe we made significant progress on demonstrating the capacity of our business to drive elevated growth rates or return. So, for example, we've now exceeded 50% year-over-year growth for 5 consecutive quarters. And we've delivered a 2-year cumulative average growth rate of 55%. T hat said, we are seeing significant headwinds heading into Q4 that are driving a near-term deceleration in our topline, including the iOS ad changes that Evan just spoke about, as well as the supply chain disruptions and labor market headwinds. While the challenges we face in the near-term are significant, we believe they are transitory. We believe the fundamentals of our business remain strong. Our community is growing at the fastest rates we have reported in more than four years. We continue to have deep penetration of hard-to-reach audiences in the most attractive advertising markets in the world. And measurement issues aside, our ads continue to drive impact and we continue to have significant opportunities to expand our monetization to more screens within our app in order to grow our ARPU over time. So, we continue to be focused on investing in our teams and our products in order to overcome the near-term challenges and to support the long-term growth of our business. Thanks for the question and I hope that provides some helpful additional context.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs, please go ahead.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks for taking the question and maybe I'll follow up on Rich's broader point and try to narrow it down a little bit. If we look out over the next 12 months, can you give us a little bit of sense of how much of investments need to be made in some of these solutions to transition the advertising industry and your advertiser based to where you want them to go, and maybe drill down a little bit deeper in terms of duration of what it would take to prove out on some of the additional solutions for folks to get more comfort in measurement and attribution over the medium to long term. Thanks so much.\nJeremi Gorman : Sure. Thanks so much for the question. This is Jeremi. We are definitely focused on assisting our advertisers in terms of navigating this environment, it's the most important thing that we can do. As Evan mentioned, it's definitely a change from  last decade or longer. And we want to make sure that we're with them every single step of the way to ensure they have the solutions that they need in place to measure the efficacy of their advertising, so it's our most important priority. Here's what we're doing. There are three primary areas where we see the opportunities to help them. First, just for the advertisers who choose to utilize SKAdNetwork, we're sharing best practices to best ensure that advertisers can remain successful as they test and learn with less information than they're used to, as Evan mentioned. Secondly, onboarding advertisers into our first-party privacy-safe solutions such as Advanced Conversions, the way it worked seamlessly with our mobile measurement partners and uses aggregated privacy-safe methodologies help advertisers understand the impact does not  their media mix. That's also new. So that's important to know -- Advanced Conversions -- and people are also going to have to take time to test and learn, to better understand how it works in partnership with SKAdNetwork and so on and so forth. So, we're working with them, product engineering, as well as sales account management. The whole team holding hands with our customers to ensure that they get the best experiences. Third, we are investing in growing our set of native experiences. And that will allow advertisers to drive ROI with deeper experiences. But all within Snapchat. And so, one of the things that's really important about that is that they will be able to get signals from within our app itself, which include our augmented reality experiences, many of which we've talked about, business profiles, which are growing and we're excited about, as well as the native commerce products that we're building on Shopify and their advertising sets, for instance. We think this approach is reflected in our success driving continued growth in active advertisers. And again, grew in Q3, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter to their highest level ever and so that gives us some good confidence there. And in terms of deploying the additional solutions, this is going to be an iterative process. iOS 14.5 was one thing. iOS 15 will be a different thing. So, we're continuing to work very closely with product and engineering to ensure that we have the right solutions in front of the right advertisers when they need them. We are ready in terms of product, of course, but we're going to keep improving the quality of that over time. A couple of examples, we talked about Advanced Conversions. We've launched that already for both web and app advertisers, and we have about 50% of our app advertisers opting in via their media measurement partner or with direct integrations. We also have a litany of other direct integrations with some of our largest advertisers, and that's been really helpful as well, working with solutions engineers, and other team members. We recently enabled the advertisers, some of these ones, who are the most leaned in to advertise across both opt-in and opt-out users, using Privacy Safe delivery and measurement to deliver efficient ads. And then -- sorry, this long answer here, but it's really important to us to share what we're doing with the advertisers. But additionally, we've started the roll out of estimated conversions, which is new, but allows advertisers to see accurate estimations of their results more quickly, but at Privacy Safe levels of resolution that may not have been otherwise available. That product is rolling out over the course of Q4 and is new. But as for the current state of the product, one of the most important things we can view is more education. We need to help advertisers adopt it by giving high touch support from sales, from marketing, from engineering, from product marketing, etc. and proving it works and building that trust with our advertising partners. The data that we're seeing does give us confidence that that adoption and the adoption of advanced conversions, is a good place to be. We are confident in that solution. We believe it is the right solution, but that education takes time. There's going to be a lot of testing and learning.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRoss Sandler : Great. Jeremy, just one follow-up on that last answer, and then maybe one for Derek. So, if we look at the average e-commerce campaign on Snapchat, how much is the  on iOS eroded versus what you were seeing back in prior to June. And do you think these tooling solutions are going to bring us back to previous levels or do you view all this privacy stuff just kind of permanently impairing the rollout that e-commerce companies can achieve on Snap? And then Derek, you've talked in the past, a couple of years ago about how the fourth quarter usually has a bigger mix of brand advertising relative to other quarters, and how direct response mix is down a little bit. So, I guess how much of this 30% growth that we're guiding to in 4Q is based on that mix dynamic, and maybe a little color on what those two channels are assumed to grow. Is it -- are they both growing about the same in the fourth quarter? That will be helpful. Thanks a lot.\nJeremi Gorman : Sure thing. I can take the first part of your question. We can't be specific on return on ad spend, but web is less affected because of the privacy-safe snap pixel and conversion API. We're really able to better understand and drive performance for e-commerce. In addition to that, we have advanced conversions for the web advertisers -- what we talked about in the last answer, but that's actually been available since the Spring. So, we're continuing to learn, test, iterate with our advertising partners there. And then in terms of just  in general, our first-party measurement tools and studies continue to show that our ads are effective and they are approximately as effective as they were prior to these changes. So, it's really that the loss of signal required significant changes to our overall technology, and we believe it's actually mostly a measurement challenge, not a question of the efficacy of our advertising, and as we talked about before, it's going to take time for advertisers to sort through what they are seeing in their new measurement solutions. And relative to what they have available to them, including an SKAdNetwork, and with conversion studies. We are optimistic that our first-party solutions, including Advanced Conversions and estimated conversions are going to help close that measurement gap for our advertising partners. And we look forward to seeing those be fully adopted. And in the meantime, we're going to be validating with our partners, third-party, first-party, through things like conversion-less studies as well as MMM studies, et cetera, to calibrate across  I will let Derek answer this part.\nDerek Andersen : Hey Ross. Thanks for the question. I will take the part about the mix and the business heading into Q4. So, the first thing I'd share is just that both the brand and the DR portions of our business are impacted by the headwinds we're seeing in Q4. Our DR business, which is the majority of our revenue, is facing the headwinds directly from the iOS platform changes that we described earlier. The supply chain and labor shortage related headwinds that we're seeing in Q4 impact a wide variety of advertising partners across a wide variety of industries, including both brand and DR oriented advertising partners. So, we would normally expect a bit of a mix shift towards brand-oriented spending in the second half of Q4. And this is typically helpful to driving the overall demand and therefore pricing in the auction during this period. Yeah. Heading into this quarter, I think it's challenging to predict the exact mix or precise mix, but our guide reflects both of these two headwinds persisting throughout Q4. So hopefully that gives you a little bit more context and is help with your question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nDoug Anmuth : Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to follow-up on Ross' question. Derek, just wondering if you could be any more specific in terms of the ad categories and verticals that you're seeing most impacted by both the IOS changes and then also the supply chain and labor disruptions. And then, a separate topic, just curious on Spotlight, how you're thinking about the product there and when it will be the right time to move beyond some of the very early ad testing and monetize the product in a bigger way. Thanks.\nDerek Andersen : It's Derek speaking. I could take the second half of your question first then I'll turn it over to Jeremi to talk about the advertising partners and how they're being impacted. In terms of Spotlight, it's very early for this platform. We're excited about the early results that we're seeing from an engagement perspective. We're also -- in terms of having seen the DAU on that platform continuing to grow quarter-over-quarter in time spent per DAU. We're also pleased to see that after the changes we've made to our creator fund that we've seen, the submissions doubled quarter-over-quarter. So, we're pleased, but it remains early for this platform. We're excited about the potential for the platform to add to our ARPU opportunity over the long term. But we're focused still on making sure that the customer experience is great and continuing to invest in optimization and our creator community. I will turn it over to Jeremi to talk about the specific impacts on different customer categories.\nJeremi Gorman : Sure. Yes, definitely. Thanks Derek. So just to talk about some of the verticals we're seeing most impacted by the iOS changes, and then also by the supply and inventory constraints. We've been meeting with a lot of advertisers, have a lot of meetings here, and we're hearing from partners across a wide variety of industries and geographies that they're facing headwinds in their business related to the disruptions in global supply chain, as well as labor shortages and later -- labor competition. So, when they're talking about the product, putting marketing into the product when there's already low-margin, for instance, can erode margin. And furthermore, they don't necessarily want to accelerate the sales of products that they are going to have a hard time getting into the hands of customers. And that is somewhat broad sweeping in terms of the supply chain issues which I'm sure we  about more broadly than just on this call here. But one of the things I think that's great is that there are still categories where there is an opportunity for us. Those were less reliant on supply chain, things like streaming, things like entertainment. We're seeing travel come back, which is really exciting. And Fintech, etc. Those types of resources are not as impacted by supply chain and we've done this successfully in the past. When COVID hit last year, we -- it suddenly disrupted a number of our key verticals in the way that supply chain is doing so right now, and we were able to redeploy our resources across sales and product and marketing to focus on the categories with momentum and those who can win despite an externality or macroeconomic condition that may be impacting their businesses. We did that successfully before by supporting our partners who are facing challenges, while doubling down on those less reliant on those macro conditions. We expect this to impact advertiser demand in the short-term. In particular, and in many cases with the backup with the ships in Los Angeles and everything else we've been reading about. And we also expect that conflated with the IOS platform, is that what we're seeing is that some of these clients are just going to take this additional time to test and learn as they navigate the changes to the IOS platform and the diminished need to drive incremental demand at the same time because their supply chains aren't able to operate at peak capacity. But we have plenty of these categories that aren't reliant and we're having great meetings with them. And as said, early tests show that the performance still looks good in those categories, and so we'll navigate this as we've done some of the externalities in the past. The underlying fundamentals of the business haven't changed and we're just remaining laser-focused on working with our advertising partners to get through these challenges.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Q - Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nBrent Thill : Thanks. Derek, is there an easy way to frame IDFA versus supply chain? Is IDFA 80%, 90% of the headwind, 10 to 20 on supply chain? It's just an easy framework how you're thinking about the balance of those two and there was just a follow-up question as it relates to what your impacting from the next version of iOS 15 and that headwind you've  in. Can you just give us a sense of what that is?\nDerek Andersen : Hey, thanks for the question. I think -- you know what I would say is when you look at Q3 and the impacts that we saw in Q3 relative to our expectations entering the quarter, the majority -- the primary driver of the impact there is really about the impacts on headwinds associated with the platform changes on iOS. Those changes accelerated as we moved through the quarter. So, what you are seeing when we go into Q4 is a full quarter impact of those issues on Q4. And the reason that we're mentioning IOS 15 is that that's going to continue to disrupt the advertising ecosystem, which is critical -- getting a stable base under the advertising ecosystem, so that advertisers have some stability to then be able to adopt tools, test tools, and understand their impact is really important. So that is contributing to the IOS headwinds persisting throughout Q4. In terms of giving you a specific breakdown of the mix of the impact between the supply chain and labor shortage headwinds and the IOS headwinds, I think that's very difficult. Hard because the two of them compound on one another in terms of their impact on the contestation, and therefore, the level of pricing that we would expect to see in the auction, especially in the second half of the quarter, which makes delineating between the two impacts, unfortunately, challenging. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of context to your question.\nBrent Thill : Yes, it does. Thanks, Derek.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tom Champion with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nTom Champion: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Maybe for Derek. Relative to our estimates, it looks like Europe and rest-of-world's revenue was a little more impacted by headwinds in 3Q. Just curious if that's the case or if there's anything to call out here. And then relative to content submissions on Spotlight doubling quarter-over-quarter, can you just update us on how you're investing directly behind this? Maybe how do you creator futures play into this momentum and just anymore comments on how usage trended quarter-over-quarter as well. Thank you.\nDerek Andersen : Sure. Thanks for the question. So, I think when we were looking at the performance by region, we're continuing to make progress on hiring and investing in our team globally across sales, marketing, partnerships, and sales support, as we believe this will position us well to grow our business over the longer-term. In Q3 our business was healthiest in North America because we continue to benefit from the significant investments we have made in sales and sales support in the prior year. We're in the early stages of ramping the investments in our team internationally, but we are making progress, and this is a driver of our rapid headcount and OpEx growth that you can see in the recent quarters. That being said, it takes time for those resources to become productive. So, we don't expect an immediate impact to the topline in the near-term, but that should give you a little bit of context about why North America performed relatively better in the period. I'm going to turn it over to Evan to share a little bit more about how we're thinking about the product and our investments around engagement on Spotlight.\nEvan Spiegel : Hey, Tom. Thanks for the question. We're certainly excited about what we're seeing on Spotlight. I'd say the primary focus and the biggest investments we're making in Spotlight are really in the underlying infrastructure, the content understanding, content recommendation, and ranking so that we can make sure that as people submit new content to Spotlight, we understand what's most compelling, who that will appeal to the most in terms of their own unique interest, and then make sure that content is really distributed to that. And that's how we can ensure creator success, not just for the most famous creator s that get a huge number of views across a really big audience. But for creators that also want to reach a niche audience with their own unique interest. And so being able to really understand the content of the Snap allows us to help creators who are just getting started, who maybe don't appeal to as big of an audience is still find that success on our platform. So, I think the infrastructure piece is critical and that's where a lot of our focus is right now. And as we evolve the creator program and the way that we're rewarding folks who are submitting content, we've also found new ways to incentivize the diversity of content submission, which again is then making it easier for our systems to understand a wider variety of content and make sure it gets to the right people. So, I'd say that's the primary focus right now. That will also help, of course, drive overall time spent viewing content, which has -- creates this positive flywheel where more creators are getting more visibility and finding more success. And then, of course, we're also investing in new ways for creators to monetize with Snap. The latest, of course, being our gifting program, which is off to a pretty fun start, where folks who find creators they really like, they can send them gifts and messages to build a relationship and say thanks for the great content that they're making. And we also have a creator marketplace as well to make it easier for brands to partner with creators and create sponsored content. So, yeah, there's a lot going on there, but I think the fundamental thing we're really focused on, at least over the next year or two is really the content recommendation and understanding, and that's our key infrastructure.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session, as well as Snap Inc's third quarter 2021 earnings conference call.

            "content": "Thanks, Jeremi. Our Q3 financial results reflect our priorities of growing our community, making focused investments in the future of our business, and scaling our operations efficiently in order to drive towards profitability and positive free cash flow. As Evan mentioned earlier, our community grew to 306 million daily active users in Q3. An increase of 57 million or 23% year-over-year. Q3 marks our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in excess of 20%. And it's tied with the prior quarter for the highest rate of growth for our community in more than four years. In North America, DAU grew by 6 million or 7% year-over-year to reach 96 million. In Europe, DAU grew by 8 million or 11% year-over-year to reach 80 million. In rest of world, DAU grew by 43 million or 49% year-over-year to reach 130 million. As we continue to execute against the international growth playbook we laid out at our Investor Day earlier this year, including investments in local language support, local content, local marketing partnerships, and support for local creator communities. Total revenue for Q3 was one billion, sixty-seven million, an increase of 57% year-over-year. This was 3 million below our guidance range entering the quarter, which primarily reflect headwinds associated with iOS platform policy changes. Direct response advertising has comprised the majority of our business for some time now, and has also been growing at relatively higher rates in recent quarters due to the impact of changes in the iOS ecosystem that affect optimization and measurement of direct response advertising objectives. The revenue from this portion of  Business was approximately flat quarter-over-quarter. Our brand focused advertising business was the primary driver of sequential growth in Q3, and remained healthiest in North America during the quarter. In North America, our revenue grew 60% year-over-year in Q3. while ARPU grew 49% year-over-year, as we continue to benefit from the significant investments we made in our sales teams and sales support in the prior year. In Europe, revenue grew 49% year-over-year in Q3, While ARPU grew 34% year-over-year. In rest of world, revenue grew 53% year-over-year in Q3, while ARPU grew 3% year-over-year. As we've indicated in the past, we are continuing to accelerate our investments in sales and sales support beyond North America in order to capture our global ARPU opportunity fast er in the years ahead. Given the rapid growth of our community and rest-of-world and the relatively early stage of our investments in sales and sales support in this region, rest-of-world ARPU is best considered as an output metric at this stage. Average ECPM increased 62% year-over-year in Q3. Rising ECPM relative to the prior year reflects the year-over-year rise in overall demand, a mix shift towards relatively higher ECPM products, as well as a mix shift towards relatively higher ECPM regions such as North America. In addition, we have observed sequential and year-over-year increases in the cost -per-action for our goal-based bidding products, which we attribute to the loss of signals that our advertising partners had previously relied on to measure the impact of their campaigns. Adoption of our new measurement solutions, such as advanced conversions is ongoing but will take time to be fully adopted. In addition, the ecosystem for measuring advertising returns is continuing to shift, with more changes anticipated as part of IOS 15, that are expected to further reduce the availability of certain signals that are currently used broadly as tools for optimization and measurement. Continuing to evolve and adapt our measurement solutions amid the rapidly shifting operating environment is a top priority as we seek to deliver attractive returns on advertising spent for our advertising partners over the long term. The ongoing growth of our community, and strong engagement in areas of our application that we have not yet begun to monetize, provide confidence in the value of our inventory and platform over the long-term, as we continue to navigate these changes. Gross margins were 60% in Q3, an increase of approximately two percentage points year-over-year and four percentage points sequentially, which brings us to the 60% medium-term goal we noted at our Investor Day, much sooner than anticipated. Gross margins may occasionally be volatile as we make investments in the long-term growth of our business as demonstrated by our investments in Spotlight. But we continue to deliver against our goal of driving down our underlying infrastructure unit costs over time to achieve long-term margin expansion. Infrastructure costs per DAU was $0.66 in Q3, down from $0.70 in the prior year. But up from a record low as a public Company of $0.62 in the prior quarter. The sequential rise in this metric reflects investments in machine learning to support our direct response advertising business and spotlight content optimization, as well as investments in support of our overall community growth. On the content side, we continue to invest in spotlight, and this contributed to year-over-year growth in cost of revenue. But the level of investment declined sequentially, reflecting a full quarter of the new structure for this program to promote more content diversity across categories and regions. We continue to be highly encouraged by the early returns from our investments in Spotlight with daily Spotlight submissions more than doubling compared to the prior quarter, and ongoing quarter-over-quarter growth in both daily active users of Spotlight and daily time spent per user. While it is still very early for this new platform, we are excited about the potential for Spotlight to further expand our monetization opportunity in the future. We are particularly pleased that we have been able to continue to invest in Spotlight and Discover while expanding our gross margins year-over-year, which reflects our overall approach of scaling our operations efficiently while making investments in the future of our business. Operating expenses were 464 million in Q3, up 37% year-over-year. As expected, our rate of hiring stepped up in Q3. Total employee-related costs were up 31% year-over-year, driven by a 40% increase in full-time headcount. This reflects ongoing investments in our team, as well as the integration of acquisitions made over the past year, which contributed approximately 10% points of the year-over-year growth in full-time headcount. In addition, we increased our investments in marketing, both sequentially and year-over-year with the launch of the Open Your Snapchat campaign in Q3. Lastly, certain costs that were significantly diminished due to the pandemic-related restrictions in the prior year, including travel and event-related costs, are gradually returning to our cost structure and contributed in part to the year-over-year growth rate of operating expenses. Adjusted EBITDA was 174 million in Q3, an improvement of 118 million year-over-year as we continued to grow our top-line rapidly while scaling our cost structure efficiently. We delivered adjusted EBITDA leverage of 30% in Q3 as we continue to invest in the future of our business while making progress towards sustained profitability and positive free cash flow. Net income was negative 72 million in Q3, an improvement of 128 million over the prior year, which reflects the flow-through of the $118 million improvement in adjusted EBITDA, as well as 122 million higher gains on investments in the quarter. This was partially offset by 120 million higher stock-based compensation. While headcount growth is the largest driver of this expense, accounting for more than 60% of the year-over-year increase, the impact of long-term retention associated with several acquisitions completed in the last year and the impact of higher payroll-related taxes, due to our higher stock price, were also significant drivers of the year-over-year increase. While we have continued to grow our team and leveraged stock-based compensation strategically to foster an ownership culture and drive long-term retention. We have remained focused on managing these programs, responsible. Total, fully Diluted shares outstanding grew 4.6% year-over-year in Q3. A significant portion of this year-over-year growth was driven by 1.1 billion of early conversions of our outstanding convertible notes, that were completed in Q2 and Q3 of 2021. Excluding dilution related to convertible notes, the rate of growth and fully diluted shares outstanding was just 1.3% year-over-year, down from 1.7% in the prior quarter, and well below the 3% estimate we shared during our recent Investor Day that was noted to be exclusive of any dilution related to convertible notes. Free cash flow for Q3 was positive 52 million, or $121 million improvement versus the prior year, driven primarily by the improvement in adjusted EBITDA noted earlier. We ended the quarter with 3.5 billion in cash and marketable securities up from 2.7 billion in the prior year as the proceeds and convertible notes issued over the past year more than offset the investments we have made to grow the business over the same period. As a result of the early conversion of our convertible notes, mentioned earlier, we have been able to build our cash position to fund long-term investments, while maintaining a responsible level of overall debt of 2.3 billion in Q3, which is approximately flat year-over-year on an apple-to-apples basis after adjusting for the impact of adopting the new accounting standard for convertible notes. This reflects our approach of managing our balance sheet conservatively and responsibly to support the long-term growth of our business. Q3 marks our second quarter of positive Free Cash Flow. And we are also Free Cash Flow positive on a year-to-date basis, which marks an important milestone for our Company as we transition towards self-funding our investments and the future of our business. The progress we have made in expanding our growth margins, and balancing our investments in operating costs as we scale our business, have enabled us to drive 34% of incremental revenue to the adjusted EBITDA  over the trailing 12 months. Which demonstrates the potential for our business to deliver substantial free cash flow generation as we scale our top-line overtime. As we look forward to Q4, we faced a variety of challenges in the operating environment, including the iOS platform changes, as well as macro uncertainty driven by supply chain disruption and labor shortages. The fact that these challenges are largely exogenous, makes the provision of guidance particularly challenging and complex. We expect that the measurement and optimization foundations of the digital advertising economy will continue to experience significant changes in the months ahead, including additional disruptions we expect related to the adoption of iOS 15. We are focused on helping our partners navigate these changes, but we still expect these headwinds to continue to impact our business throughout Q4, as the adoption of new measurement solutions will take time. It is still not clear what the longer-term impact of the iOS platform changes may be. And this may not be clear until at least several months or more after the ecosystem stabilizes and advertisers are able to fully implement the new solutions we are developing. In addition, we are hearing from advertising partners across a wide variety of industries that they are facing disruptions in their supply chains, as well as labor shortages. Unfortunately, these changes are occurring during a season when our advertising partners would normally expect our supply chains to be operating at peak capacity, and at a time when we would otherwise expect peak advertising demand to drive peak contestation and therefore peak pricing in our auction. While it is difficult to predict the duration and magnitude of these macroeconomic factors on the businesses of our partners, we have assumed that these headwinds will persist throughout Q4. When combined with the measurement-related headwinds we are seeing in our direct response business, we expect a compounding impact on the level of contestation and pricing in our auction-based ecosystem, relative to what we would otherwise expect during the second half of Q4 in particular. We currently estimate the DAU will be 316 million to 318 million in Q4, implying year-over-year growth of 19% to 20%. On the monetization side, we currently estimate Q4 revenue will be between 1.165 billion and 1.205 billion implying year-over-year growth of between 28% and 32% in Q4. On the expense side in Q4, we intend to continue to invest in our teams and products to support the long-term growth of our business in order to build on the momentum we have established with our community and our partners. Our estimates for Q4 adjusted EBITDA reflect our revenue guidance and our expected level of investment, resulting in a range of 135 million to 175 million for Q4. Thank you for joining our call today, and we will now take your questions. Hey, Rich, it's Derek speaking. I will take the second half of your question as it pertains to long-term growth opportunity of the business. The first thing I'd share here is that we believe the fundamentals of our business are intact and we remain confident in the long-term growth potential of the business. We believe we made significant progress on demonstrating the capacity of our business to drive elevated growth rates or return. So, for example, we've now exceeded 50% year-over-year growth for 5 consecutive quarters. And we've delivered a 2-year cumulative average growth rate of 55%. T hat said, we are seeing significant headwinds heading into Q4 that are driving a near-term deceleration in our topline, including the iOS ad changes that Evan just spoke about, as well as the supply chain disruptions and labor market headwinds. While the challenges we face in the near-term are significant, we believe they are transitory. We believe the fundamentals of our business remain strong. Our community is growing at the fastest rates we have reported in more than four years. We continue to have deep penetration of hard-to-reach audiences in the most attractive advertising markets in the world. And measurement issues aside, our ads continue to drive impact and we continue to have significant opportunities to expand our monetization to more screens within our app in order to grow our ARPU over time. So, we continue to be focused on investing in our teams and our products in order to overcome the near-term challenges and to support the long-term growth of our business. Thanks for the question and I hope that provides some helpful additional context. Hey Ross. Thanks for the question. I will take the part about the mix and the business heading into Q4. So, the first thing I'd share is just that both the brand and the DR portions of our business are impacted by the headwinds we're seeing in Q4. Our DR business, which is the majority of our revenue, is facing the headwinds directly from the iOS platform changes that we described earlier. The supply chain and labor shortage related headwinds that we're seeing in Q4 impact a wide variety of advertising partners across a wide variety of industries, including both brand and DR oriented advertising partners. So, we would normally expect a bit of a mix shift towards brand-oriented spending in the second half of Q4. And this is typically helpful to driving the overall demand and therefore pricing in the auction during this period. Yeah. Heading into this quarter, I think it's challenging to predict the exact mix or precise mix, but our guide reflects both of these two headwinds persisting throughout Q4. So hopefully that gives you a little bit more context and is help with your question. It's Derek speaking. I could take the second half of your question first then I'll turn it over to Jeremi to talk about the advertising partners and how they're being impacted. In terms of Spotlight, it's very early for this platform. We're excited about the early results that we're seeing from an engagement perspective. We're also -- in terms of having seen the DAU on that platform continuing to grow quarter-over-quarter in time spent per DAU. We're also pleased to see that after the changes we've made to our creator fund that we've seen, the submissions doubled quarter-over-quarter. So, we're pleased, but it remains early for this platform. We're excited about the potential for the platform to add to our ARPU opportunity over the long term. But we're focused still on making sure that the customer experience is great and continuing to invest in optimization and our creator community. I will turn it over to Jeremi to talk about the specific impacts on different customer categories. Hey, thanks for the question. I think -- you know what I would say is when you look at Q3 and the impacts that we saw in Q3 relative to our expectations entering the quarter, the majority -- the primary driver of the impact there is really about the impacts on headwinds associated with the platform changes on iOS. Those changes accelerated as we moved through the quarter. So, what you are seeing when we go into Q4 is a full quarter impact of those issues on Q4. And the reason that we're mentioning IOS 15 is that that's going to continue to disrupt the advertising ecosystem, which is critical -- getting a stable base under the advertising ecosystem, so that advertisers have some stability to then be able to adopt tools, test tools, and understand their impact is really important. So that is contributing to the IOS headwinds persisting throughout Q4. In terms of giving you a specific breakdown of the mix of the impact between the supply chain and labor shortage headwinds and the IOS headwinds, I think that's very difficult. Hard because the two of them compound on one another in terms of their impact on the contestation, and therefore, the level of pricing that we would expect to see in the auction, especially in the second half of the quarter, which makes delineating between the two impacts, unfortunately, challenging. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of context to your question. Sure. Thanks for the question. So, I think when we were looking at the performance by region, we're continuing to make progress on hiring and investing in our team globally across sales, marketing, partnerships, and sales support, as we believe this will position us well to grow our business over the longer-term. In Q3 our business was healthiest in North America because we continue to benefit from the significant investments we have made in sales and sales support in the prior year. We're in the early stages of ramping the investments in our team internationally, but we are making progress, and this is a driver of our rapid headcount and OpEx growth that you can see in the recent quarters. That being said, it takes time for those resources to become productive. So, we don't expect an immediate impact to the topline in the near-term, but that should give you a little bit of context about why North America performed relatively better in the period. I'm going to turn it over to Evan to share a little bit more about how we're thinking about the product and our investments around engagement on Spotlight."

            "name": "Jeremi Gorman",
            "content": "Thanks, Evan. In Q3, we generated total revenue of $1.067 billion, an increase of 57% year-over-year, as we grappled with industry changes to the way advertising is targeted, optimized, and measured on iOS that created a more significant impact on our business than we had expected. Despite these challenges, we crossed 1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time, and we remain focused on our long-term opportunity to support our community and advertising partners, which we believe will be driven by three key priorities. First, driving ROI through measurement, ranking, and optimization. Second, investing in our sales and marketing functions by continuing to train, hire, and build for scale. Third, building innovative ad experiences around video and augmented reality with a focus on commerce. Additionally, we reach a valuable and hard-to-find audience, which continues to grow around the world. Together, we believe that over the long term, these factors will allow us to drive performance at scale for businesses around the world. We are continuing to work through the ongoing changes to digital advertising driven by Apple's App tracking transparency framework, which was introduced as part of IOS 14.5. We saw meaningful adoption in June and July, when Apple pushed all of its users to update to the new version of iOS  speaking, these changes have upended many of the industry norms and advertiser behaviors that were built on IDFA, Apple's unique device identifier for advertising, over the past decade, which now require a double opt-in by users in order to access directly. As part of these changes, Apple rolled out SKAdNetwork or SKAN as a proprietary solution to allow app-based advertisers to continue measuring their advertising on iOS. The initial results we observed using SKAN were generally aligned with prior industry standard solutions. And we were among the first platforms to lean into this solution and push for widespread industry adoption. However, over time, we saw SKAN measurement results diverged meaningfully from the results we observed on other first and third-party measurement solutions. Thinking scan unreliable of a standalone measurement solution. Furthermore, as our advertising partners have explored and tested SKAN solutions, they have serviced a variety of concerns about its limitations. Every advertiser has their own unique, fine-tuned perspective on their optimal parameters to measure ROI for their business. but SKAN requires them to use Apple's fixed definitions of advertiser success. For example, advertisers are no longer able to understand the impact of their unique campaigns based on things like time between viewing an ad and taking an action, or the time spent viewing an ad. Additionally, real-time campaign and creative management is hindered by extended reporting delays and advertisers are unable to target advertising based on whether or not people have already installed their app. As a result, we have accelerated our focus on developing additional first-party privacy safe solutions to help our advertising partners measure their campaigns effectively. Our primarily solution is advanced conversions, which work seamlessly with our mobile measurement partners, and uses aggregated privacy safe methodologies to help advertisers understand the impact of Snapchat and their media mix. This solution is now launched for all eligible advertisers and we are encouraged by the early adoption we're seeing from apps. Even with a basic feature set, we have approximately 50% of app advertisers opting in via their media measurement partner or direct integrations. We are excited to invest in both third-party and first-party solutions to provide a richer set of privacy-safe tools to our partners to help them measure and optimize their advertising. We otherwise continue to see strong sustained performance in our app advertising platform as measured by both first-party engagement data and incremental Lift studies, and believe the long-term shift towards privacy-safe solutions will be a net benefit to our community and our business. We are working closely with our advertising partners to help them grow their businesses with our large engaged audience. This work will not only address the near-term disruptions driven by ATT, but it will also help our partners adapt for the long-term, privacy-oriented future. Over the last couple of years, our direct response business has grown at a faster rate than our brand business. This is something of which we are incredibly proud and continue to feel is the right strategy for the long-term. Proving performance and delivering ROI are our top priorities, and we've made significant progress over the past several years. As we've mentioned, for the past few quarters, DR has grown to comprise over 50% of our business. While this has been a historic strength, given the recent ATT changes coupled with Snapchat's existence as a mobile-only platform, our strengthened DR has become a more significant headwind in the current environment. However, we still believe that in time, every advertiser will be a performance advertiser. And despite the recent shake up in the ecosystem, driving DR performance is the right strategy over the long term. Separate from these iOS related issues, we've heard from advertising partners across a wide variety of industries and geographies that they are facing headwinds in their business related to disruptions in global supply chains, as well as labor shortages and increasing costs. In turn, we expect this to impact advertising demand in Q4 in particular, as in many cases, their businesses do not have the inventory or operational capacity to support incremental demand. We expect that some of these clients may opt to slow their marketing spend given the diminished need to drive incremental demand at a time when their supply chains are not able to operate at peak capacity. We continue to invest in our sales teams and marketing initiatives in order to support our advertising partners and achieve our long-term revenue and ARPU goals. For example, this quarter, our marketing team launched the Open Your Snapchat campaign, which invites both customers and advertisers to fully dive into Augmented Reality, unlocking hundreds of custom experiences localized to several different markets across the globe. The campaign highlights many of our e-commerce advertiser and B2B relationships. This week, we rolled out a new ad experience lining the walkway of the Westfield Bridge in London, which feature lenses with brands including American Eagle, Ralph Lauren, and the Jordan brand. While still in early days, we have already seen positive signs of the campaign's success, including lists and consideration, and trust among our 25 to 34-year-old audience. The team also launched Snapchat Trends in the quarter, a self-service tool which allows our advertising partners to discover and explore trends across Snapchat, so they can find what topics perform well on Snapchat and better engage with our community. We continue to invest heavily in professional content and video advertising to support our community and advertising partners. For example, we partnered with Hollister to seamlessly integrate custom ads within our new Snap original, Lago Vista. Each episode included three commercials featuring one of the series' cast members sporting Hollister gear. And a third commercial introduced a new, custom, Hollister -branded Augmented Reality lens which included prompts that Snap chatters could tap to visit the Hollister website. The entire ad experience focused on creating cohesive branding with our Snap original content, which led to strong view rates and share rates. We believe that Camera and Augmented Reality represents our most exciting long-term revenue opportunity, particularly as brands start to build always-on AR strategies for their business. Augmented reality advertising is a fully immersive experience that is delivering a return on investment for advertisers, that is measurable and repeatable, which is encouraging more and more businesses to invest in AR. For example, Ultra Beauty leveraged our GBB pixel purchase optimization for AR to bring unique makeup try-on experiences to Snap chatters, which drove over a 4.5 times higher return on ad spend compared to its campaign optimized for impression. The success of the try-on lens ultimately encouraged Ultra Beauty to include AR lenses within its long-term business strategy. We have continued to roll-out a number of tools and capabilities to help empower AR commerce on Snapchat. Not only can our AR try-on technology drive higher return on ad spend for businesses. But it can also deliver a huge uplift for brands, because Snap chatters can visualize what they look like wearing different products. For example, Samsung Watch 3 adopted our AR try-on lens in the U.K. to drive product awareness for its latest wearable technology. The campaign delivered impressive Brand Lift measurement results, including a 23-point lift in product awareness driven by those exposed to the lens. Now, businesses of all sizes are beginning to invest in their own public profile, which gives them a free permanent home on Snapchat, where they can showcase compelling AR experiences and share shoppable products directly within the app. The Department of Culture and Tourism, Abu Dhabi launched its first official public profile in Q3, which aims to give potential visitors a chance to discover what the UAE's capital has to offer. The new profile has already driven incremental engagement with Snap chatters. The stories format highlights the destination's many offerings, and the AR experiences are an immersive way to explore Abu Dhabi virtually. One of our top priorities for AR is reducing the barrier to creation and helping brands understand the importance of AR and the value it can drive. One of the ways in which we are improving this is through our recent acquisition of Vertebrae, a platform that enables brands and retailers to develop 3D AR assets. Vertebrae's team and technology will further our AR apparel and 3D asset roadmap by providing the backend platform to create, manage, and deploy AR assets. We are offering 3D asset creation as a service to help businesses create AR content at scale and drive business results. This platform will also make it even easier for brands to activate AR shopping experiences on Snapchat. Additionally, we announced a new partnership that will give WPP and its clients more access to Snaps AR technology and resources, including classes on how to use AR, creative production and campaign measurement. We also just announced the launch of our new global creative studio for branded AR called Arcadia. Powered by the team of world-class experts that pioneered mobile AR advertising, Arcadia will develop new technology and deliver the most innovative, impactful, and effective AR experiences to brand in agency partner. Arcadia will be platform-agnostic and develop experiences that can live across different platforms, including the web and app-based AR environment. Lastly, when brands use a portfolio approach of combining sponsored AR lenses with Snap Ads, they result in higher ROI and lower cost per outcome. For example,  spiral campaign utilizing Snap Ads, Story Ads, and a lens to generate double-digit lifts in brand awareness and ad awareness. And 9-point lift in watch intent. When Snap chatters were exposed to multiple products, brand-awareness and watch intent increased by two times and three times respectively, ultimately reinforcing the value of leveraging our different ad formats together to drive performance and ROI. In summary, we are working very closely with our advertising partners to build and adapt for the future. While there will be near-term monetization challenges related to our direct response business and the macroeconomic environment, we ultimately believe that the best way to retain and build relationships with advertisers, is to continuously they deliver measurable ROI. We will continue to invest for the long term and making product and marketplace improvements to help advertisers scale, build focused relationships with brands and agencies across verticals, and improve our direct response products and measurement solutions for performance centric businesses. Based on the size of our audience, their levels of engagement across our service, and our overall opportunity in the growing digital advertising market, we are well-positioned to play an important role in driving results for businesses across the world. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Derek. Sure. Thanks so much for the question. This is Jeremi. We are definitely focused on assisting our advertisers in terms of navigating this environment, it's the most important thing that we can do. As Evan mentioned, it's definitely a change from  last decade or longer. And we want to make sure that we're with them every single step of the way to ensure they have the solutions that they need in place to measure the efficacy of their advertising, so it's our most important priority. Here's what we're doing. There are three primary areas where we see the opportunities to help them. First, just for the advertisers who choose to utilize SKAdNetwork, we're sharing best practices to best ensure that advertisers can remain successful as they test and learn with less information than they're used to, as Evan mentioned. Secondly, onboarding advertisers into our first-party privacy-safe solutions such as Advanced Conversions, the way it worked seamlessly with our mobile measurement partners and uses aggregated privacy-safe methodologies help advertisers understand the impact does not  their media mix. That's also new. So that's important to know -- Advanced Conversions -- and people are also going to have to take time to test and learn, to better understand how it works in partnership with SKAdNetwork and so on and so forth. So, we're working with them, product engineering, as well as sales account management. The whole team holding hands with our customers to ensure that they get the best experiences. Third, we are investing in growing our set of native experiences. And that will allow advertisers to drive ROI with deeper experiences. But all within Snapchat. And so, one of the things that's really important about that is that they will be able to get signals from within our app itself, which include our augmented reality experiences, many of which we've talked about, business profiles, which are growing and we're excited about, as well as the native commerce products that we're building on Shopify and their advertising sets, for instance. We think this approach is reflected in our success driving continued growth in active advertisers. And again, grew in Q3, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter to their highest level ever and so that gives us some good confidence there. And in terms of deploying the additional solutions, this is going to be an iterative process. iOS 14.5 was one thing. iOS 15 will be a different thing. So, we're continuing to work very closely with product and engineering to ensure that we have the right solutions in front of the right advertisers when they need them. We are ready in terms of product, of course, but we're going to keep improving the quality of that over time. A couple of examples, we talked about Advanced Conversions. We've launched that already for both web and app advertisers, and we have about 50% of our app advertisers opting in via their media measurement partner or with direct integrations. We also have a litany of other direct integrations with some of our largest advertisers, and that's been really helpful as well, working with solutions engineers, and other team members. We recently enabled the advertisers, some of these ones, who are the most leaned in to advertise across both opt-in and opt-out users, using Privacy Safe delivery and measurement to deliver efficient ads. And then -- sorry, this long answer here, but it's really important to us to share what we're doing with the advertisers. But additionally, we've started the roll out of estimated conversions, which is new, but allows advertisers to see accurate estimations of their results more quickly, but at Privacy Safe levels of resolution that may not have been otherwise available. That product is rolling out over the course of Q4 and is new. But as for the current state of the product, one of the most important things we can view is more education. We need to help advertisers adopt it by giving high touch support from sales, from marketing, from engineering, from product marketing, etc. and proving it works and building that trust with our advertising partners. The data that we're seeing does give us confidence that that adoption and the adoption of advanced conversions, is a good place to be. We are confident in that solution. We believe it is the right solution, but that education takes time. There's going to be a lot of testing and learning. Sure thing. I can take the first part of your question. We can't be specific on return on ad spend, but web is less affected because of the privacy-safe snap pixel and conversion API. We're really able to better understand and drive performance for e-commerce. In addition to that, we have advanced conversions for the web advertisers -- what we talked about in the last answer, but that's actually been available since the Spring. So, we're continuing to learn, test, iterate with our advertising partners there. And then in terms of just  in general, our first-party measurement tools and studies continue to show that our ads are effective and they are approximately as effective as they were prior to these changes. So, it's really that the loss of signal required significant changes to our overall technology, and we believe it's actually mostly a measurement challenge, not a question of the efficacy of our advertising, and as we talked about before, it's going to take time for advertisers to sort through what they are seeing in their new measurement solutions. And relative to what they have available to them, including an SKAdNetwork, and with conversion studies. We are optimistic that our first-party solutions, including Advanced Conversions and estimated conversions are going to help close that measurement gap for our advertising partners. And we look forward to seeing those be fully adopted. And in the meantime, we're going to be validating with our partners, third-party, first-party, through things like conversion-less studies as well as MMM studies, et cetera, to calibrate across  I will let Derek answer this part. Sure. Yes, definitely. Thanks Derek. So just to talk about some of the verticals we're seeing most impacted by the iOS changes, and then also by the supply and inventory constraints. We've been meeting with a lot of advertisers, have a lot of meetings here, and we're hearing from partners across a wide variety of industries and geographies that they're facing headwinds in their business related to the disruptions in global supply chain, as well as labor shortages and later -- labor competition. So, when they're talking about the product, putting marketing into the product when there's already low-margin, for instance, can erode margin. And furthermore, they don't necessarily want to accelerate the sales of products that they are going to have a hard time getting into the hands of customers. And that is somewhat broad sweeping in terms of the supply chain issues which I'm sure we  about more broadly than just on this call here. But one of the things I think that's great is that there are still categories where there is an opportunity for us. Those were less reliant on supply chain, things like streaming, things like entertainment. We're seeing travel come back, which is really exciting. And Fintech, etc. Those types of resources are not as impacted by supply chain and we've done this successfully in the past. When COVID hit last year, we -- it suddenly disrupted a number of our key verticals in the way that supply chain is doing so right now, and we were able to redeploy our resources across sales and product and marketing to focus on the categories with momentum and those who can win despite an externality or macroeconomic condition that may be impacting their businesses. We did that successfully before by supporting our partners who are facing challenges, while doubling down on those less reliant on those macro conditions. We expect this to impact advertiser demand in the short-term. In particular, and in many cases with the backup with the ships in Los Angeles and everything else we've been reading about. And we also expect that conflated with the IOS platform, is that what we're seeing is that some of these clients are just going to take this additional time to test and learn as they navigate the changes to the IOS platform and the diminished need to drive incremental demand at the same time because their supply chains aren't able to operate at peak capacity. But we have plenty of these categories that aren't reliant and we're having great meetings with them. And as said, early tests show that the performance still looks good in those categories, and so we'll navigate this as we've done some of the externalities in the past. The underlying fundamentals of the business haven't changed and we're just remaining laser-focused on working with our advertising partners to get through these challenges."

            "name": "Evan Spiegel",
            "content": "Thank you all for joining us. This quarter we celebrated Snap's 10-year anniversary, and as we reflect on the progress we've made over the past decade, we have never been more excited about our future. Bobby and I grew up with social media and we wanted to build something different, a way for people to have fun and express themselves without the permanence and pressure of public likes and comments. We built a camera to make it easier for people to communicate with close friends and family and express themselves visually. And today we reach more than 500 million people, including more than 75% of 13 to 34 year - old's in the U.S, Canada, France, the UK, Australia, and the Netherlands. We have innovated on top of our camera and build augmented reality, content, and mapping platforms that each reach hundreds of millions of people. We are now operating our advertising business at scale, providing us with the resources we need to invest in our long-term vision of computing overlaid on the world through our camera. And we are just getting started. This quarter, we grew daily active users to 306 million, marking our fourth consecutive quarter of more than 20% year-over-year growth. We grew sequentially in North America and Europe, which represent our largest monetization opportunities in the near and medium-term, and we continue to build on our momentum in the rest of world geographies, where we see massive long-term potential. Our DAU and rest-of-world represents just 5% of the overall rest-of-world smartphone population, which is currently more than 2 billion people and growing. Many of the mixed engagement trends we observed during the pandemic and that we discussed on our last earnings call have continued through the third quarter. On one hand, while total content viewership and time spend has grown year-over-year, user-generated stories continue to see year-over-year declines in overall time spend. On the other hand, we are seeing quarter-over-quarter improvements in engagement with the Snap map, story, posting, new friend connections, and bi-directional communication. And we're cautiously optimistic about the ongoing reductions in pandemic-related restrictions worldwide. We grew our revenue 57% year-over-year to reach $1.067 billion, delivering adjusted EBITDA of $174 million and $52 million of free cash flow. While we are excited about the continuing growth of our business and improvement in our cost structure, we missed the lower end of our guidance by $3 million due to a few key factors, including changes to advertising tracking on iOS and macroeconomic factors that have impacted our advertising partners. Our advertising business was disrupted by changes to iOS ad tracking that were broadly rolled out by Apple in June and July. While we anticipated some degree of business disruption, the new Apple provided measurement solution to not scale as we had expected, making it more difficult for our advertising partners to measure and manage their ad campaign for IOS. We have remained very focused on driving ROI for our advertising partners, and we continue to see strong consistent performance on our ad platform, based on first-party data and conversion lift studies, and are working on building flexible first-party tooling and measurement solutions to serve the diverse needs of our advertising partners. This impact was compounded by the ongoing macroeconomic effects of the global pandemic with our advertising partners facing a variety of supply chain interruptions and labor shortages. This, in turn, reduces their short-term appetite to generate additional customer demand through advertising at a time when their businesses are already supply constrained. The ongoing magnitude and duration of these global supply and labor disruptions are inherently unpredictable. In the meantime, we are focused on supporting our partners in this uncertain environment. While it is difficult to predict the trajectory of these challenges, the growth of our audience, the adoption of our new products and platforms by our community, and the underlying efficacy of our advertising products for performance advertisers gives us confidence in the future of our business and our ability to navigate this environment as we continue to invest in our long-term vision. Augmented reality is one of our most exciting long-term opportunities, because it is simultaneously very early in its technological development and already used by hundreds of millions of people. More than 200 million people engage with AR every day on Snapchat across a variety of use cases including entertainment, fashion, education, and the arts. This quarter, we partnered with Sign All to introduce three AR lenses teaching Snap chatters how to finger spell in American sign language. We featured a number of community trial lenses to celebrate Fashion Week. And we partnered with Sotheby's to allow Snap chatters to experience Christo and Jeanne-Claude's artistic rendition of the Arc de Triomphe from anywhere in the world. We are also doubling down on the early successes we have seen helping people try on clothing, beauty products, and accessories with augmented reality, and are working closely with partners like Ralph Lauren, MAC Cosmetics, and Zenni Optical to expand our AR shopping experiences on today's smartphones. In the longer term, we are investing in new ways people can interact with the physical world around them, including using our, our AR-enabled spectacles. We're thrilled to see the unique experiences our creator community has developed for this new form factor, as we iterate on our long-term hardware products roadmap. Our content partners continue to find success on our platform with 15 different partners, each reaching over 50 million Snap chatters this quarter. Two of our new Snap originals launched this quarter, mean mom and Honestly Lauren, and each reached over 10 million viewers. We are also introducing more locally relevant content as our community grows worldwide. In France, we partnered with M6, our first major French broadcast partner for entertainment content, to bring 400 episodes of their TV shows to Snapchat. In Mena, we partnered with ITP Media Group to bring more than 200 show episodes from some of the region's biggest and most influential creators. We are very excited about the long-term potential of Spotlight, our newest platform designed to shine a light on the best snaps created by our community. In recent months, we have focused on building the tools and infrastructure to help creators of all kinds thrive on Spotlight. We have re-engineered the spotlight incentive programs to reach more creators who are publishing a greater diversity of content in more markets. We are committed to making Spotlight a platform on which professional creators can grow an audience and build a business, and both gifting and the creator marketplace for Spotlight are now live. We are extremely pleased to see daily Spotlight submissions more than double when compared to last quarter and are encouraged by ongoing quarter-over-quarter growth in both daily active users of Spotlight and daily time spent per user. We will continue to build Spotlight into a unique entertainment destination for our community and are rewarding creative outlet for people expressing themselves through our camera. We are also continuing to innovate and improve our products for both our community and our partners. We launched the Places tray, which allows the 250 million Snap chatters that use the Snap Map each month to save their favorite locations and explore what places are popular among their friends. We expanded our minis offerings to include our first CoWatching experience with HBO Max, as well as a new birthday mini to provide reminders for friends' birthdays. Our new Run for Office mini, which helps young people run for local office, encouraged more than 2 million Snap chatters to explore local election opportunities, and more than 45,000 people have nominated a friend to run for office. Profiles now support next-generation 3D bitmoji, letting people express themselves through a variety of options for backgrounds, poses, and facial expressions. As we reflect on the past decade, we are fortunate to have grown our business in a favorable economic, regulatory, and geopolitical environment. We prioritize growing our business responsibly and sustainably, rather than scaling as fast as possible. And our commitment to privacy and empowering self-expression through our camera, led us to build our products in a way that we believe enables our future success over the long term. As we look to the future, these fundamental decisions, along with the scale we have already achieved in our business and operations, gives us confidence that we have the resilience to maintain our momentum through a changing macro environment. Now I will turn the call over to Jeremy to share more about our business. Hey Rich. Thanks so much for the question and share your disappointment. This has definitely been a frustrating setback for us. But I think over the long term these privacy changes and protecting privacy for users of IOS and of course, the Snapchat community, is really important to the long-term health of the ecosystem and something that we fully support. I think when we saw these changes coming, our primary focus was the performance of our advertising platform in the face of this signal law. So, could we still really drive advertising performance, optimize campaigns, make sure our adds were in front of the right people. And we spent the vast majority of our engineering time and effort and energy, making sure our ads were still really effective. And we did all sorts of revenue back testing to make sure that we could be revenue neutral. We were really confident in our ability to drive results with our advertising platform despite the signal loss. But what I think we really underestimated where the tooling changes. And so, what I mean by that specifically is that, advertisers have essentially for a long time now. use a set of really sophisticated tools to measure and optimize their campaign. So that allows them to test out a bunch of different creative and see what's performing more effectively and so on and so forth. And the big change there was that with these new Apple changes, those tools were essentially rendered blind, and in their place, Apple released a new product called SKAdNetwork that allows advertisers to measure across different advertising platforms but without a lot of the flexibility that they're used to. For example, you can only really measure your advertising results using the success parameters that Apple's already defined. The reporting is delayed for a significant period of time and often unavailable if you don't hit a certain threshold of conversions. It's very hard to see performance on a creative level. But of course, it does have the benefit of being able to look across different advertising platforms. So, what we've done is built our own solution called Advanced Conversions that allows people to do much more sophisticated things and really get the benefits of a lot of flexibility using the advanced conversions product so they can understand performance at the creative level, optimize for down funnel conversions and things like that. And we've been working really hard to make that solution more effective and help advertisers onboard. But the obvious challenge with advanced conversions is that it only has Snapchat first-party data, it doesn't have the benefit of looking across all of the other advertising platforms. So what advertisers essentially have to do is use both of those tools,  ad network and advanced conversions. And the way that they're able to understand the performance of both is by running incrementality testing for example, that shows you how performing your advertising is on different platforms. And that process, adopting A  network, adopting advanced conversions, running incrementality testing, and really building trust in these new solutions after the tooling you've been using for a decade has essentially gone away. That just takes time and is really challenging. So, we definitely underestimated that impact. We're advertising partners, we're working through it. We've certainly seen some early signs of success. But it's going to take a little while. I think the good thing is that we remain very confident in the underlying performance of our advertising products. And when we look at incrementality testing, when we look at first-party data like on platform swipes or installs, things like that, we see that those conversions are still happening at similar rates that they did in the past. So, I think we can work through the tooling issues; it will take time because they're new. But the underlying performance of the advertising platform is still very strong. Hey, Tom. Thanks for the question. We're certainly excited about what we're seeing on Spotlight. I'd say the primary focus and the biggest investments we're making in Spotlight are really in the underlying infrastructure, the content understanding, content recommendation, and ranking so that we can make sure that as people submit new content to Spotlight, we understand what's most compelling, who that will appeal to the most in terms of their own unique interest, and then make sure that content is really distributed to that. And that's how we can ensure creator success, not just for the most famous creator s that get a huge number of views across a really big audience. But for creators that also want to reach a niche audience with their own unique interest. And so being able to really understand the content of the Snap allows us to help creators who are just getting started, who maybe don't appeal to as big of an audience is still find that success on our platform. So, I think the infrastructure piece is critical and that's where a lot of our focus is right now. And as we evolve the creator program and the way that we're rewarding folks who are submitting content, we've also found new ways to incentivize the diversity of content submission, which again is then making it easier for our systems to understand a wider variety of content and make sure it gets to the right people. So, I'd say that's the primary focus right now. That will also help, of course, drive overall time spent viewing content, which has -- creates this positive flywheel where more creators are getting more visibility and finding more success. And then, of course, we're also investing in new ways for creators to monetize with Snap. The latest, of course, being our gifting program, which is off to a pretty fun start, where folks who find creators they really like, they can send them gifts and messages to build a relationship and say thanks for the great content that they're making. And we also have a creator marketplace as well to make it easier for brands to partner with creators and create sponsored content. So, yeah, there's a lot going on there, but I think the fundamental thing we're really focused on, at least over the next year or two is really the content recommendation and understanding, and that's our key infrastructure."

With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Evan.\nEvan Spiegel: Thank you all for joining us today. Our second quarter results reflect the broad-based strength of our business and the hard work of our team as we execute to serve our community and partners. This quarter we grew both revenue and daily active users at the highest rates we have achieved in the last four years. Daily active users grew 23% year-over-year to 293 million, and we more than doubled revenue year-over-year to $982 million, generating $117 million in adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA improved by $213 million compared to last year, marking our third adjusted EBITDA profitable quarter in the last 12 months as we continue to demonstrate the leverage in our business as we scale. At our annual Partner Summit in May, we introduced new product innovations for our community and partners, including the next generation of Spectacles augmented reality glasses that overlay computing on the world, and we are excited by the tremendous opportunity for our business in 2021 and beyond. We made significant progress with our augmented reality platform this quarter. More than 200 million Snapchatters engage with AR every day on average, and over 200,000 creators use Lens Studio to build AR Lenses for our community. We are focused on learning from our large and engaged community of Snapchatters and creators, which allows us to continually improve our AR Lenses and the tools we provide to create them in Lens Studio. This quarter, our Cartoon 3D Style Lens, which uses machine learning to turn people into a 3D-animated cartoon in real-time, highlighted the power of Lenses to go viral both inside and outside of Snapchat. In the first week of release, it generated 2.8 billion impressions on Snapchat alone. We rolled out Lens Studio 4.0 at our Partner Summit, with new features like visual classification, multiperson 3D body mesh, advanced cloth simulation, TrueSize technology for eyewear try-on, and a new visual effects editor, which enables creators to build sophisticated Lenses without writing any code. We also launched Connected Lenses, which enables real-time shared experiences in augmented reality, like building a LEGO model together with your friends. We are continuing to create value for businesses by reimagining the shopping experience through AR. By leveraging the long-term investments we\u2019ve made in augmented reality and personalization, we are laying the groundwork for an improved online shopping experience. For example, we are making it easier to discover new fashion items through Scan by helping Snapchatters scan a friend\u2019s outfit, or a saved photo or screenshot, to shop similar looks and recommendations. When it comes to purchases and returns, we believe that helping people find the right size and improving the try-on experience could both increase conversion rates for purchases as well as reduce the rate of returns for online shopping. We are excited about this opportunity because returned goods cost businesses hundreds of billions of dollars each year, and have a large environmental impact. We are pleased with our early progress in this space, and look forward to experimenting and learning more with our retail and e-commerce partners. We are also collaborating with a variety of partners to power AR experiences in their own applications with Camera Kit, which brings the power of the Snapchat camera to partner applications using our SDK. This quarter, we rolled out a number of Camera Kit partnerships worldwide, including with Walt Disney World. We\u2019ll commemorate their 50th anniversary with an AR experience where visitors can place their own picture on Cinderella\u2019s Castle to create a virtual mosaic of shared moments, as well as access exclusive AR Lenses with Disney characters through the My Disney Experience app. We also partnered with Bumble and Viber to bring Lenses to their respective mobile apps, and are working with Google to bring our Lenses directly to the new JioPhone in India with a native camera integration. We announced our next generation of Spectacles at our Partner Summit, which are available exclusively for creators. They are our first device with a built-in 3D augmented reality display, and represent another step forward toward our goal of overlaying computing on the world. We are investing heavily in augmented reality across Snapchat, Camera Kit, and Spectacles, and we are excited to continue learning and making progress toward our long-term vision. We also announced a number of new products and partnerships at our Partner Summit for Maps, Minis, and Games. We are adding Layers to the Snap Map, so that Snapchatters can find personalized local experiences from our partners overlaid directly on the Map. For example, users will be able to see restaurant recommendations from The Infatuation or their own saved Snaps from Memories on the Map. We are also expanding our Minis platform, including a new Mini featuring daily shopping events hosted by Poshmark. Ticketmaster is partnering with us across a few of these products, with a Mini where you and your friends can discover different artists and shows and buy tickets, which also integrates directly with the Ticketmaster Layer on our Map that overlays different concerts and events directly on the Snap Map. We are adding new titles and genres to Snap Games, with Voodoo launching five new games to Snapchat this year. We have learned that players who use their Bitmoji in a game spend twice as much time playing, which is one reason Unity is bringing 3D Bitmoji into their mobile, PC and console games with our new Unity plugin. We have observed a number of changes in content engagement as we evolve our content products and manage through the mixed impacts of the pandemic. For example, global time spent watching content on Snap grew year-over-year, while lapping the boost in engagement we saw at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, but we have also observed a year-over-year decrease in daily time spent watching user-generated Stories created by friends, even as the number of daily viewers of that content has grown year-over-year. We believe this is due in part to a decline in the volume of daily Story posting activity on Snapchat coinciding with mobility restrictions and behaviors related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduces the amount of content created by friends that is available to watch. While it is unclear when these restrictions will end and how user behavior will evolve, we are seeing stabilization and early recovery in Story posting as some communities are reopening and reducing restrictions, and we are cautiously optimistic that this will lead to increased time spent watching Stories from friends as the world begins to open up. Meanwhile, we are continuing to evolve our overall content products and business. As we learn more about the different types of content that our community wants to watch and that drive successful outcomes for our partners, we are doubling down on what is working well. Based on these learnings, we are adapting and expanding our content offerings from both our media partners and our creator community in order to appeal to the diverse variety of interests of our community. For example, Shows are seeing ongoing success on our platform, and we aired eight new Snap Original Shows this quarter. Many of our partners reach a broad audience through several different channels, and nine different partners reached more than 30 million unique Snapchatters in the United States alone. We added 177 new international Discover channels this quarter to support our international growth strategy and deepen engagement. For example, total daily time spent by Snapchatters in India watching Shows and publisher content increased by 150% year-over-year. Additionally, we are seeing early promise in showcasing the best and most entertaining Snaps from our community on Spotlight. While we are still in the early phases of launch and iteration, we are excited about our learnings and progress so far. Engagement is growing rapidly as we roll out Spotlight worldwide, with Spotlight DAU growing 49% quarter-over-quarter, and average daily content submissions more than tripling when compared to the prior quarter. We are also seeing time spent growing rapidly, with daily time spent per user on Spotlight in the United States growing more than 60% in the last quarter, giving us additional confidence in our ability to build Spotlight into a meaningful business over time. There is still a lot of work to do as we build out Spotlight and innovate to improve the product experience. For viewers, we are adding new features like the Trending Page, while improving personalization and ranking, in order to show the right content to the right people based on their engagement and interests. For creators, we are making it easier to create compelling content using creative tools in our camera, and we launched Creative Kit for Spotlight so that creators can easily create and submit videos to Spotlight from applications like Voisey, Beat Leap, and Video Leap. We signed deals with Universal Music Group, Sony ATV and DistroKid in the first half of 2021 to increase the availability of Sounds on our platform and to help our community discover new artists. We are also helping creators monetize and develop relationships with members of our community through products like Gifting, our Creator Marketplace, and by supporting them directly through our Creator Fund, which we are continuing to evolve as we move beyond our initial launch. While we are still very early on this journey, we are excited about our ongoing work with Spotlight to help our community discover new content and creators while also supporting our global creator community. We\u2019ve now spent over a year working from home, and we have learned so much as a team about how to execute remotely while continuing to deliver rapid product innovation. While we are excited to see each other in person after all this time, we are also planning to retain many of the behaviors and practices we developed during the pandemic so that we can continue benefiting from the flexibility of being able to work and collaborate remotely. This new way of working has brought us closer together as a team and helped us to work more effectively as a global business with team members and partners located around the world. I am deeply grateful for the resilience of our team during such a difficult period, and I am optimistic about the progress we are continuing to make in growing our company. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jeremi to share more about our business.\nJeremi Gorman: Thanks, Evan. We\u2019re pleased with our results this quarter and believe our business is well-positioned for the future. In Q2, we generated total revenue of $982 million, an increase of 116% year-over-year, reflecting the momentum in our advertising business and the hard work of our team serving our partners and helping them generate return on their investment. We benefited from a favourable operating environment and continued success with both direct response and large brand advertisers, and we continue to leverage our performant ad products to grow our advertiser base globally. We are fully focused on making progress against our revenue and ARPU opportunities, which we believe will be driven by three key priorities. First, driving ROI through measurement, ranking, and optimization, second, investing in our sales and marketing functions by continuing to train, hire and build for scale and third, building innovative ad experiences around video and augmented reality, with a focus on shopping and commerce. Our commitment to these three priorities, along with our unique reach and large, engaged community, allows us to drive performance at scale for businesses around the world. We believe all advertisers optimize for driving ROI and measuring performance. We have accelerated our efforts to drive ROI for our advertising partners via lower-funnel bidding capabilities, which allow advertisers to optimize for the objectives they are trying to achieve, and our innovative ad units, which are tailored for the most sophisticated performance advertisers. For example, Booking.com employed a strategy that used Dynamic Ads to reach new customers on Snapchat. By utilizing our Dynamic Ad solution for travel, they were able to dynamically pull images directly from their product catalog that displayed relevant and visually appealing destination photos and features. This helped Booking.com unlock an incremental audience within the United States, which resulted in a positive incremental lift in bookings across both their website and their app, and delivered a cost per incremental booking of approximately 36% lower than their goal. Our ad platform is being utilized as an effective self-service tool to help advertisers of all types and sizes create, manage, and measure campaigns on Snapchat. Further, it is a reflection of our focus on privacy and innovation as we are delivering results for advertisers, while also respecting the privacy of our community, which has been a core tenet since we launched ads on Snapchat. This year has clearly demonstrated how important it is to simultaneously meet these two objectives for our advertising partners. As Apple rolled-out its App Tracking Transparency-related changes near the end of Q2, we observed higher opt-in rates than we are seeing reported generally across the industry, which we believe is due in part to the trust our community has in our products and our business. Apple\u2019s rollout of the most recent iOS update came later in Q2 than initially anticipated, and the pace of updates by iPhone users has also been slower than we anticipated. This has given us more time with advertisers to navigate the transition but also means the effects of these changes will come later than we initially expected. We continue to work with our advertising partners on privacy-safe solutions and other attribution techniques. For example, we fully rolled out support of SKAdnetwork version 3.0, which we believe will aid in improving attribution for advertisers who have implemented Apple\u2019s API. We also launched Advanced Conversions in Ads Manager, which allows advertisers to measure their campaigns via our privacy-protecting measurement stack. We are dedicated to delivering value for our advertising partners while respecting the privacy of our community, as we have worked to do for many years. That said, it remains very early in the adoption of the iOS platform changes, and we will continue to learn how these changes may impact our advertising partners, business, and the industry as a whole. We are seeing some initial signals as advertisers test and learn in this new environment and this is causing some interruptions to demand that we had anticipated would be part of the adoption process, particularly in the direct response e-commerce and gaming sectors. It is too early to determine how long it will take until these changes are fully adopted, the scale of the potential interruptions to demand, or the ultimate impact on the longer term growth of our business. We have proven through our efforts in North America that with a robust team, surrounding resources, and a local focus, we can accelerate revenue. We are now taking that model and replicating it in several markets that we have identified as having a large digital advertising market and significant levels of existing Snapchat adoption. We have a lot of room to grow in some of the world\u2019s most established ad markets outside of North America, especially in Europe. For example, in the UK, France, and the Netherlands, we reach over 90% of 13 to 24 year olds and 75% of 13 to 34 year olds. We will continue to make progress on hiring and investing in our team globally across sales, marketing, and partnerships, among many others, as we believe this investment will position us well to grow our business over the long-term. We continue to invest heavily in video advertising, with the goal of driving results for our advertising partners and connecting them to the Snapchat Generation. For example, we worked with Nielsen to help U.S. advertisers understand how to more efficiently reach their target audiences via Snap Ads. The total ad ratings study analyzed how over 30 cross-platform advertising campaigns reached people on both Snapchat and television. The analysis showed that Snapchat campaigns contributed an average of 16% incremental reach to advertisers\u2019 target audiences, and over 70% percent of the Gen Z audience that was reached by Snapchat was not reached by TV-only campaigns. This is especially important as people are increasingly cutting the cord, and mobile content consumption continues to grow, presenting us with a large opportunity to help advertisers reach the Snapchat Generation at scale. Augmented reality advertising is delivering a return on investment that is measurable and repeatable, which is encouraging more and more businesses to invest in AR. For example, Smile Direct Club leveraged our Goal-Based Bidding Click optimization for AR, which drove 49% of Snap customer leads in Q2 and was the most effective ad unit at driving traffic for their business compared to other social channels. The success of the Lens ultimately encouraged Smile Direct Club to include AR Lenses as part of their long-term business strategy. We are doubling down on our efforts to help advertisers improve conversions and ROI, and recently launched our GBB Purchase optimization for AR, which allows advertisers to optimize their AR campaigns for down-funnel purchases and fits well into our shopping strategy. We continue to roll out a number of products and features to help empower AR commerce on Snapchat. We recently launched Public Profiles for all businesses, which give businesses of all sizes a free, permanent home on Snapchat where they can highlight engaging content, showcase compelling AR experiences even after a campaign is finished, and share shoppable products directly within the app. Public Profiles allow brands to build a direct relationship with our community, and we are already seeing some of the largest brands investing in their profile. For example, Nike leveraged our AR Lenses as part of its Play New campaign to encourage Snapchatters to get active, and the company is planning to build additional Lenses for its Public Profile. In addition, at our Partner Summit in May we launched unique new try-on capabilities, such as wrist tracking technology for watches and jewelry, and TrueSize technology for eyewear, which complement our existing foot tracking technology, and are all designed to give Snapchatters more confidence in the ability for AR try-on to emulate a physical shopping experience. For example, watchmaker Piaget is using wrist tracking technology to make it possible to try on a variety of different timepieces, and businesses like Zenni Optical are using our TrueSize technology to help Snapchatters find frames that fit them perfectly. Through new 3D body mesh capabilities, retailers now have the ability to showcase products realistically on the body. This has come to life for brands like Prada that created a bag try-on experience for Snapchatters to shop directly in the camera. Additionally, brands like Farfetch are tapping into these technologies to allow our community to try on and shop a variety of jackets from its catalog. All of these technologies and more are available in Lens Studio for the world\u2019s leading creators and agencies to build for brands. We also recently built a new AR beauty template in Lens Web Builder, which allows beauty brands to upload their entire catalog and publish AR Lenses quickly and in a cost effective manner. For example, e.l.f. Cosmetics is able to pull in many of their 800 product SKUs to create unique makeup try-on experiences; and with the Lenses they\u2019ve built thus far, are already seeing Snapchatters engage with their products in new ways. We are in the process of onboarding hundreds of emerging Gen Z-focused beauty brands who will be able to leverage this technology for their AR campaigns. We have a lot more work ahead to build out our technology and increase AR adoption, but we are thrilled with the results that our partners are seeing as we invest in our long-term camera opportunity. When brands utilize a portfolio approach of combining sponsored AR Lenses with Snap Ads, they result in higher ROI and lower costs per outcome. For example, global sports streaming service DAZN launched a multi-product campaign that utilized AR Lenses, Snap Ads, Story Ads and Commercials in order to drive awareness for its live sports channels, installs for its app, and subscriptions for its streaming service. DAZN leveraged our new GBB App Install optimization for AR, which not only drove incremental installs, but also reached millions of unique Snapchatters. The overall campaign resulted in lifts and installs in subscriptions and drove incremental Snapchatters to its platform, ultimately reinforcing the value of leveraging our ad formats together to drive performance and ROI. We will continue to invest for the long-term by demonstrating measurable ROI for our advertising partners, providing support through our sales and marketing functions, and leading the way with innovative advertising products and services to help advertisers scale. We are confident in our long-term opportunity, and are excited to double down on shopping and commerce via augmented reality. Given our community, their depth of engagement on our platform, and our overall opportunity to take share of the growing digital advertising market, we believe we are well positioned to drive business results for advertisers over the long-term. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Derek.\nDerek Andersen: Thanks, Jeremi. Our Q2 financial results reflect our priorities of growing our community, making focused investments in the future of our business, and scaling our operations efficiently in order to drive towards profitability and positive free cash flow. As Evan mentioned earlier, our community grew to 293 million daily active users in Q2, an increase of 55 million or 23% year-over-year. The growth in our community continues to be broad based, with year-over-year and sequential growth on both iOS and Android platforms. In North America, DAU grew by 5 million or 6% year-over-year to reach 95 million. In Europe, DAU grew by 7 million or 10% year-over-year to reach 78 million. In Rest of World, DAU grew by 43 million or 55% year-over-year to reach 120 million. The continued robust growth in Rest of World reflects the benefit of our ongoing investments in local content, local language support, marketing partnerships, and the popularity of augmented reality Lenses created by our global community. Total revenue for Q2 was $982 million, an increase of 116% year-over-year as we lapped the quarter in the prior year where the pandemic most significantly impacted advertising demand. We benefited from an improved operating environment in Q2 and strong momentum with our advertising products and partners. In addition, the iOS platform policy changes that we anticipated could disrupt advertising demand in Q2 of this year did not materialize as expected in Q2 as the changes were rolled out later and adoption occurred at a slower than expected pace. In North America, revenue grew 129% year-over-year in Q2, while ARPU grew 116% year-over-year as we continue to benefit from the significant investments we made in our sales teams and sales support in the prior year. In Europe, revenue grew 94% year-over-year in Q2, while ARPU grew 76% year-over-year. In rest of world, revenue grew 86% year-over-year in Q2, while ARPU grew 20% year-over-year. As indicated in the prior quarter, we are continuing to accelerate our investments in sales and sales support beyond North America in order to capture our global ARPU opportunity faster in the years ahead. Average eCPM increased 122% year-over-year in Q2. Rising eCPM relative to the prior year reflects the rapid rise in overall demand, improved optimization capabilities within our auction, a mix shift toward relatively higher eCPM products, as well as a mix shift toward relatively higher eCPM regions such as North America. Dynamic Ads are a great example of an ad product where we are seeing the power of product innovation and auction optimization to deliver return on ad spend while achieving relatively higher yields for our inventory with revenue from Dynamic Ads more than doubling sequentially. With the rapid rise in total revenue of 116% year-over-year, and 28% percent sequentially, the rate of growth in demand outpaced the rate of new optimizations delivered in the quarter and we observed sequential increases in cost per action for our goal based bidding products in the quarter as a result. We continue to invest heavily in our teams and tools to continually enhance our optimization capabilities over time and this is a top priority as we seek to deliver attractive returns on advertising spend for our advertising partners over the long term. In addition, the ongoing growth of our community, and strong engagement in areas of our application that we have not yet begun to monetize, provide us with the opportunity to expand our inventory and grow our long-term ARPU opportunity over time. Gross margins were 55% in Q2, an increase of approximately 9 percentage points year-over-year and 8 percentage points sequentially. We continue to make significant progress against our goal of driving down our underlying infrastructure unit costs over time. In Q2, we continued to benefit from several recent efficiency improvements delivered by our engineering teams, as well as negotiated rate improvements for several of our cloud services. In addition, the acceleration in growth of our community has been a modest benefit to infrastructure cost per DAU in recent quarters as new users tend to have lower initial marginal cloud infrastructure costs relative to longer tenured Snapchatters. These factors combined to deliver infrastructure costs per DAU of $0.62 in Q2, which was consistent with the prior quarter and down from $0.69 in the prior year. On the content side, we continued to invest to support the launch of Spotlight in Q2 and this contributed approximately $76 million to our cost of revenue in the quarter, which is a modest sequential decline in cost as we continue to evolve the cost structure for this program to promote more content diversity by rewarding top performing content creators while also seeding new content categories. We are pleased with our progress on this front as we\u2019ve observed all time highs in daily submissions after making these changes to the incentive program. We also continue to be highly encouraged by the early returns from our investments in Spotlight with daily time spent per user on Spotlight in the U.S. growing more than 60% in the last quarter. While it is still very early for this new platform, we are excited about the potential for Spotlight to further expand our monetization opportunity in the future. We are particularly pleased that we have been able to continue to invest in Spotlight and Discover while expanding our gross margins year-over-year, which reflects our overall approach of scaling our operations efficiently over time, while making investments in the future of our business. Operating expenses were $427 million in Q2, up 39% year-over-year. As we anticipated last quarter, our rate of hiring stepped up in Q2 and the growth in employee related costs was the single largest driver of growth in operating expenses in Q2. Total employee related costs, which represent more than 60% of operating expenses, were up 35% year-over-year driven by a 31% increase in full time headcount that reflects the ongoing investments in our team as well as the integration of recent acquisitions which contributed approximately 8 percentage points to the year-over-year growth in full time headcount in Q2. We have also continued to invest in marketing to build on the momentum we have established with our advertising partners, and in our community, with growth in these investment areas contributing in part to the growth in overall operating costs. As we anticipated last quarter, we are also beginning to see certain costs returning to our cost structure that were significantly diminished due to the pandemic related restrictions over the past year, including travel and event related costs among others. The partial return of these costs to our cost structure in Q2 was an additional factor driving the acceleration in the rate of expense growth in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $117 million in Q2, an improvement of $213 million year-over-year as we continue to grow our topline rapidly while scaling our cost structure efficiently. We delivered adjusted EBITDA leverage of 40% in Q2 as we continue to invest in the future of our business, while making progress toward sustained profitability and positive free cash flow. Net income was negative $152 million in Q2, an improvement of $174 million over the prior year and representing Net income leverage of 33% as we continue to make progress towards achieving profitability and sustained positive free cash flow generation. The year-over-year improvement in net income primarily reflects the flow through of the $213 million improvement in adjusted EBITDA as well as $80 million higher net gains on investments in the quarter. This was partially offset by $88 million higher stock based compensation driven by several factors, including approximately $43 million attributable to growth in our team due to hiring over the past year, $25 million driven by higher payroll taxes due to our higher stock price, and $13 million related to long-term retention associated with several acquisitions completed in the last year. While we have continued to grow our team, and leverage stock-based compensation strategically to foster an ownership culture and drive long-term retention, we have remained focused on managing these programs responsibly. Total fully diluted shares outstanding grew 4% year-over-year in Q2. However, excluding the shares we issued in exchange for early conversion of approximately $840 million of our convertible notes, the rate of growth in shares outstanding was just 1.7% year-over-year, down from 2.6% in the prior quarter, and below the 3% estimate we shared during our recent investor day that was noted to be exclusive of any dilution related to convertible notes. Free cash flow for Q2 was negative $116 million, or $33 million unfavorable versus the prior year. This was driven primarily by a $233 million increase in net working capital driven by the rapid sequential and year-over-year growth in revenue that was partially offset by improvements in our cash conversion cycle, including an approximately 2 day reduction in our days sales outstanding metric, which reflects our broader initiative to scale our operations efficiently. The impact of top line growth on our net working capital position was largely offset by the $213 million improvement in adjusted EBITDA noted earlier. We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, up from $2.8 billion in the prior year, as the proceeds of convertible notes issued over the past year more than offset the investments we have made to grow the business over the past year. As we look forward to Q3, we are observing a resurgence of COVID-19 cases and the ongoing impact of the pandemic around the world, which continues to present an uncertain operating environment. We currently estimate that DAU will grow at a rate of approximately 21% year-over-year, to reach approximately $301 million in Q3. On the monetization side, we note that the comparisons will be more challenging in the second half as we begin to lap the acceleration in top line growth that we experienced in the prior year. Our guidance range is for year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 58% to 60% in Q3. This range reflects our best current estimate of the potential impact of anticipated disruptions associated with the iOS platform changes. As I mentioned earlier, the iOS platform changes have been adopted more slowly than we had anticipated, and the interruptions to demand are therefore expected to come later than we initially anticipated. As a result, it is still not clear what the longer term impact of the iOS platform changes may be, and this may not be clear until at least several months or more after the changes are fully implemented. Until then, we remain focused on helping our partners navigate these changes while optimizing return on ad spend across our advertising products and platform. On the expense side in Q3, we intend to continue to invest in the long-term growth of our business in order to build on the momentum we have established with our community, our partners, and our top line growth. In addition, we expect to continue to see certain costs that were diminished during the pandemic, such as travel and event costs, continue to return to our cost structure in the quarters ahead which will impact operating expense growth. Our estimates for Q3 adjusted EBITDA reflect our revenue guidance and our expected level of investments resulting in a range of $100 million to $120 million for Q3. Thank you for joining our call today. And we will now take your questions.\nOperator: That concludes the prepared remarks for today\u2019s earnings call and we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the question. A question for Jeremi, average eCPM was up more than 120% year-over-year related to higher demand and ROI and then also product in geo mix shift. And I realize eCPM is an output for Snap and not a pure indicator of the prices that advertisers are paying, but we\u2019ve also heard a lot about price inflation across the online ad market. So just wanted to get your views on whether you think there are any risks around price inflation and how you think about sustainability going forward.\nDerek Andersen: Sure. Doug, it\u2019s Derek speaking. I can take that one on the eCPM question. You\u2019re right. We pivoted from eCPM in Q2, they were up 122% year-over-year, and we do think of eCPM at least in part is now put metric at this stage in our growth. And we expect that it could fluctuate as our business evolves over time. With that said, in Q2, in particular, we did see rising eCPM is driven by several factors. One of them is just the rapid rise in their overall advertising demand we\u2019ve experienced, which was up 116% year-over-year successfully. Mix shift towards higher eCPM products is also a factor here such as dynamic ads, the revenue from which doubled sequentially in Q2. And then we do see mixed shift across some regions with North America growing at a relatively higher rate as well. Overtime, however, there are several competing forces, many of which we have influence over that can put downward pressure on eCPM, including, one is the growth in our overall community. And we\u2019ve seen this accelerated in recent quarters with global DAU reaching 23% growth year-over-year in the most recent quarter. Second, there\u2019s the potential to expand our inventory opportunity by expanding commoditization of highly engaged areas within our application. Example, this includes the camera and given that our app opens to the camera, our audience creates billions of snaps per day. The inventory potential of the camera is already immense. So we\u2019re investing heavily in our capabilities to capture that opportunity. As you can see with our recent product announcements and acquisitions and so on, Spotlight is another example and it remains early days for this new platform, but where engagement has grown rapidly, and we\u2019re excited about the potential for spotlight to expand our ARPU opportunity over time. And the math is another really good similar sort of example, of an entirely new revenue opportunity with very attractive levels of engagement and the opportunity to serve as an on-ramp for a new audience of advertising partners over time. Last but not least, we\u2019d been investing really heavily in our ad products and optimization capabilities in order to deliver our goal based outcomes for advertisers, such as Pixel verified purchases as efficiently as possible, which allows us to expand our inventory opportunity. And then, look, lastly, I hope all of that would give you a little bit of a framework of how we\u2019re thinking about this evolving over time as these dynamics play out. So hopefully that gives you a little more context. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBrian Nowak: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. First one, just on the strength of the ad business in 2Q and then with the 3Q guide, love to sort of peel back for any more detail on the product level drivers of the ad business, what is sort of seeing the most incremental momentum between lenses and AR versus stories versus discover versus anything else that I\u2019m missing? That\u2019d be super helpful. Then the second one, Evan, just on an AR shopping, talk to us about sort of you where you think you\u2019ve made the most progress there. And then in your mind, what are sort of some of the key hurdles and friction points you need to overcome from an execution perspective to really realize that opportunity?\nJeremi Gorman: Brian, thanks so much for the question. We\u2019re really happy actually with the products across the board and the adoption. So as Derek spoke to, we\u2019ve seen a robust increase in just overall demands of our innovative ad formats and improve self-service model, which has very much enabled us to scale demand globally. And to be specific about your question and the products that we released over the last three years that continue to see strong growth, it\u2019s really in dynamic ads, down-funnel GBB as examples, being Pixel Purchase and ad purchase, commercials and shows and games, and then in self-service AR as well. So again, kind of runs the gamut there, but additionally, we continue to invest in ads, measurement and optimization, which is the most important thing for us because it helps us derive outcomes more efficiently and increase yield, but also increase performance for our advertisers. This particular flywheel is why we\u2019re so excited about our future potential across all of these products as we scale our advertising business. And I will let Evan take the second part.\nEvan Spiegel: Brian, Thanks for the question. We\u2019re super excited about AR shopping. In particular, we\u2019re focused on apparel and accessories. It\u2019s obviously a huge spending category for young people, but more importantly, it\u2019s a real opportunity for us to differentiate. So if you think about the in-store experience in a changing room, that\u2019s not particularly pleasant and at home trying to shop online and find the right size and scroll through thousands of little tiles, models were in clothing. None of those feel personal and none of them really capture the experience of trying something on, which is so important for consideration with apparel and accessories. So AR can really solve this problem in an interesting way. There are some places where I think from a product perspective, we have solved the technical challenge. So trying on a pair of shoes or a watch, sunglasses, those are all areas where today we see really great results for retailers and that\u2019s where we\u2019re focused on scaling. So helping people create and manage their 3D models and make sure that they can easily turn them into lenses. And then there are other problems that we\u2019re still working on solving. So for example, trying on a T-shirt and making sure the cost looks really realistic and drapes over your shoulders in the right way, that\u2019s much more complicated to do from a technical perspective and we\u2019re making good progress there, but it\u2019s not perfect yet. So I\u2019d say, what we\u2019ve tried to do is focus on the areas where we\u2019ve got a great technical solution and the product works and delivers results. And of course, brands we\u2019re seeing success with the lenses that they\u2019re creating. And then we\u2019re making much longer-term investments with things like fit analytics to find the right fit and the right size with all of our efforts around clothing try-on. And we released some really great new features in Lens Studio 4.0 recently that that helped get us part of the way there. But it may take a little longer for full on apparel trial. But nevertheless, we think AR is going to play a really important role. There\u2019s lots of stuff we can do to scale today, and you may have seen some of our efforts to make our beauty AR Lenses more scalable. So that we can ingest someone\u2019s entire catalog of beauty skews and help people try them on really easily through Lens web builder, so a lot of efforts to reduce friction and make it easier to scale, and then a lot of really exciting technical and product opportunities for the future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Richard Greenfield with LightShed Partners. Please go ahead.\nRichard Greenfield: Thanks for taking the questions. I\u2019ve got a few. First and it\u2019ll be quick. There\u2019s a huge advertiser demand for Spotlight, which sort of replicates the TikTok and Facebook reels sort of user mechanic. What\u2019s holding you back from starting advertising within the feed, especially when ads are already being created in similar sort of form factors on other sites to? Story Studio, I know you announced that at the partner summit. It hasn\u2019t launched yet. Curious, I guess, for Evans specifically, how do you think it\u2019s going to change the quality of the content on Snap and maybe even since it can be used for any app, how do you think it sort of leads to the use of Snap content across the broader mobile web? And then just the last piece for Jeremi specifically, curious what are the key building blocks you need ad product-wise to drive small and medium businesses to advertise in much larger numbers? Like what should we be looking for in terms of where your ad products or tech stack that needs to be done to really ramp those numbers? Thanks.\nEvan Spiegel: Hey, Rich, thanks for the great question. Yes. As you pointed out, we really pioneered that vertical video format with stories and of course now use that format in Spotlight. And so it\u2019s something that I think will transition to monetization really easily. And of course leverage our full ad stack and all of the optimizations and measurement capabilities that we offer today. We\u2019ve done some small testing with advertising in Spotlight, so that we\u2019re ready when we want to turn on. But for now, we\u2019re just really focused on the core experience. There\u2019s so much opportunity there. We\u2019ve got a great roadmap of improvements. And we just don\u2019t want the team to get distracted frankly with monetization at this point, when there\u2019s so much upside in the core user experience and core user engagement. So we\u2019ve chosen to focus on the product experience for now and then over time we\u2019ll think about monetization, but we\u2019re testing and learning, so we\u2019re ready when the time comes. And then when it comes to Story Studio, I\u2019m so glad you asked this question. It\u2019s something we\u2019re really excited about. If you think about the core Snapchat camera, we\u2019re always optimizing around communication. So we wanted to work really, really quickly. And oftentimes that means we don\u2019t offer some of the more sophisticated creative tools that you might want to use when you\u2019re making the perfect video and maybe you want to spend 20 minutes really perfecting the transitions and the text overlays and the audio and things like that. And so what we wanted to do is create a separate application, Story Studio to really focus on some of those more fine grain editing use cases to help people make really beautiful videos. And we think they\u2019re going to use them in a bunch of different ways after they create them, of course, contributing them to the Spotlight or even to make stories for discover. So we don\u2019t know what folks will make yet, but it is a really great opportunity for trust to invest in great creative tools. And over time, we may invent new creative tools in Story Studio and bring them over to Snapchat. So it\u2019s a great new way to experiment with video editing and we\u2019re really excited to get it out there.\nJeremi Gorman: Hi, Rich. Thanks for the great questions as always. I will take the small, medium business question. So specifically as it pertains to small and medium businesses, I think one of the things that can kind of get completed is that talking about local or is that talking about e-commerce and app install, et cetera. So I\u2019ll give you an answer kind of in two parts there. But the first is really the small and medium businesses as it pertains to app install and e-commerce, so digitally native businesses to be specific. We believe that we already have a lot of the tools focused on measurement ROI that flywheel, that we\u2019ve talked about in the last question, in terms of optimization and ensuring that people get results when they use things like our goal based bidding strategies. And those products are already in place, but we believe that we have a significant opportunity with a smaller growing companies in a particular space. And then looking longer term, we believe that the Snap Map and public profiles for businesses will be really key features to unlock growth in the local SMB space different than that e-comm and the app install businesses, but we\u2019re still really, really early on in this particular journey. The good news is though that Snapchatters are starting to interact with local businesses organically on the service. So as we improve the utility of those core services, we\u2019re going to be investing in more local specific advertising products, but we\u2019re not there yet. So that\u2019s what you should be looking for.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRoss Sandler: Hey, guys. Evan, just a question on engagement. You noted that time spent watching content is up overall, but it\u2019s down for user stories. So is that from less mobility or is that being cannibalized by the Spotlight engagement? And do you think you can grow both areas in tandem or should we expect that dynamic to continue?\nEvan Spiegel: Hey, Ross, thanks for the question. I think the best way to think about Spotlight\u2019s not going to be purely incremental, but so far what we\u2019ve seen is that it\u2019s largely incremental. And the reason why we think that is because Spotlight and Discover, in our stories products are really different purposes. So what we\u2019re seeing as a Spotlight is a great way to discover new content to find creators you\u2019ve never heard of before or even someone who just submitted a really funny snap that they created. And then Stories is a much more high intent product. So people make friends and want to see exactly what their friends are up to or they\u2019ve subscribed to their favorite publishers. And so what we\u2019re really interested in over time is actually the relationship between the two. So people might discover new influencers, new creators and Spotlight add them and then go view them on Discover. So I think you\u2019re right, it\u2019s not going to be purely incremental, but so far it has been largely incremental. And we\u2019re really excited about the long-term opportunity for us to evolve the relationship between the two. So Spotlight is really opened up a whole new canvas for us to explore this way of distributing content and actually help people find things, frankly, are pretty hard to find today on the Stories page.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nMark Mahaney: Thanks. I\u2019ll throw a couple of questions two, please. One on Spotlight. Your level of investment in continuing to incentivize content. Do you expect to keep that at roughly the same level or do you think you\u2019ve reached enough critical mass, where you don\u2019t need to incentivize content? Secondly, could you talk a little bit about monetization of Maps and where you are versus the path and layout some expectations please for that? And then maybe third, the high-level question for you, Evan, which is, do you think about augmented reality and virtual reality also as a potentially new compute platform over the next five to 10 years? And you\u2019ve talked about this in the past, but just your updated thinking on how much of a new \u201ccompute platform\u201d that could be. And the extent to which you think that we will just fundamentally change or at least a significant segment of the population will fundamentally change how they interact, because of AR and VR. Do you think about it as complimentary or supplementary or the \u2013 actually replace \u2013 substantially replacing current interactions? Thanks a lot.\nDerek Andersen: Hey, there, Mark. It\u2019s Derek, I\u2019ll take the first part of your question on Spotlight, then I\u2019ll turn it over to Evan on the other parts of your question. On spotlight in particular, one, we\u2019re continuing to improve the experience for our community and for our creators. For viewers, we\u2019re adding new features like the training page while improving personalization and ranking in order to show the right content to the right people based on their engagement interests. And for creators, we are making it easier to create compelling content using creator tools and our camera, and we launched Creative Kit for Spotlight so the creators can easily create and submit videos to Spotlight from applications like Voisey and so on. We\u2019re really excited about the momentum we\u2019re seeing on Spotlight, submissions have tripled sequentially. We\u2019re also seeing positive engagement trends with 49% sequential increase in DAU. We\u2019re also seeing time spent growing rapidly with daily time spent per user on Spotlight in the U.S. growing more than 60% in the last quarter. On the creator front in the level of investment, we remain dedicated to rewarding our community for what they contribute to Spotlight. We have evolved the creator fund in the most recent quarter in order to continue to reward top creators, while also seeding new content categories. And we\u2019re pleased with what we\u2019re seeing in the results of that so far, we made over the last quarter is we\u2019ve observed all time highs in daily submissions to Spotlight after making these changes. We\u2019re still very early on in this journey though, we\u2019re excited about our ongoing work with Spotlight to help our community discover new content and new creators, while also supporting our global creator community. On the monetization side of that, it\u2019s very early and we don\u2019t feel pressure to do that at this time. But hopefully that gives you a little bit of a sense of where we are on Spotlight and our commitment to investing in that product over time. I\u2019ll turn it over to Evan to handle the next parts of your question there.\nEvan Spiegel: Hey, Mark. Thanks for the questions. Two things, I love talking about. With Maps, we\u2019re really focused on the product opportunity and just continuing to evolve the platform. We see this as a huge long-term opportunity. And so it\u2019s just critical that we remain focused on delivering value to the people that use our Map. It started out with answering basic questions, like, what are my friends up to. Where are they? Or are they on their way home yet? And now has evolved to really show people what\u2019s happening around them, and of course, most recently with our Map layers really to even find events nearby or restaurant recommendations. And so what we\u2019re going to focus on now is expanding that functionality to more partners, making the Map, much, much richer in terms of its content and then doing an even better job personalizing. So over time, of course, we\u2019re going to have to filter through all the possible layers that you could engage with on the Snap Map and really find the relevant concerts or restaurants, or local parks that maybe are most interesting or important for you. So the big focus right now is, is continuing to evolve people\u2019s relationships with the places around them. We\u2019ve also released some really cool products that will allow people to favorite places or find ones that are popular with their friends. And so we\u2019re just focused on growing that engagement. And then, of course over time, we think we can provide a lot of organic value to local businesses, help show them, who their customers are, how frequently they visit, help them understand foot traffic trends. And of course, eventually help them market to reach their local customer. So that\u2019s definitely an exciting opportunity for us, but it\u2019s really important that we focus on the core of that product opportunity, because it\u2019s a really big one and something that we\u2019re really excited about. And then as it comes to augmented reality, we\u2019re really excited about the potential for AR mostly because it makes computing much more human. It\u2019s overlaid on the world around you, you don\u2019t have to look down. At a tiny screen, you can look up and be immersed in a computing experience. But that said, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a replacement at all for existing computing devices, which frankly are much more oriented around information retrieval and information organization. And I think what we\u2019re going to see instead is that augmented reality is much more oriented around human experiences. And so whether that\u2019s more recently we did a partnership with LACMA to create new monuments in Los Angeles, or learning about the world and walking through the solar system to see what it looks like. And of course, many of the other lenses we referenced earlier around commerce and try on, I think augmented reality can provide a totally new way to interact with computing that\u2019s experiential and very different than the way that we interact with computing today. So I don\u2019t think it will be a replacement. But I certainly think it\u2019s an exciting way to experience the world. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re investing so heavily, of course, in the near-term, on smartphone augmented reality, but then in the longer-term as well with wearable AR, which is something we\u2019re really excited about.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Shmulik with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nMark Shmulik: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. One follow-up if I may around e-commerce. And so, lots of deals and efforts taking place on that front, we\u2019ve heard around the business profiles, AR try-ons, et cetera. There\u2019s obviously a lot of different ways for brands and sellers to reach their customers that are being tested within Snapchat. But is there anything you could share about how Snapchatters are engaging and shopping with that content and potentially what the roadmap could look like towards perhaps like a more permanent e-store within the application? Thank you.\nJeremi Gorman: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. This is Jeremi, appreciate it. As Evan mentioned, we really think that the shift towards e-commerce is a long-term secular trend, and we know that AR can play a really pivotal role in improving the e-commerce experience for shoppers that\u2019s beneficial to both the retailer and the customer. We\u2019ve talked a little bit about this in past calls, but when you take a look at the trends that accelerated during lockdowns, it was really an interesting period of time because we had a lot of people in the Snapchat community that are fully engaged in AR, 200 million people engaging in AR every single day. And brands really needed to find a replacement for malls and for showrooms and these kinds of things, which accelerated the trends in AR. We don\u2019t look at it as necessarily one specific destination on Snapchat where people can go and experience AR or brands can have a presence, but rather the AR shopping and its entirety is a huge focus for us. But we\u2019re also looking at commerce and shopping is the type of experience that can be threaded throughout the service. So not like a specific destination, although of course, that will be available on public profiles as well. But we\u2019ve experimented with shopping, to be a screen shop, native commerce for publishers and creators and discover, and even scan to shop with our Amazon partnership that we launched a few years ago. We work with advertisers all the time, spend a lot of time with them, and they consistently tell us that Snapchat and talking with their best friends comes up as a really important part of the shopping experience. When you think of kind of the evergreen question that\u2019s been going on for years, does this look good on me? Imagine how much more effective that is in AR without having to buy something or return it later. And we\u2019re going to look to leverage those close friends, that type of sentiment as we leave shopping experiences throughout the Snapchat service in just a really natural and engaging way.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJustin Post: Great. Thank you. A couple of questions. First, what were the key drivers of revenue upside versus your expectations? Obviously, a very good quarter were there any unusual positive impacts in May or June or actually even a benefit to Snap, a shift in spend because of IDFA. And then secondly, just maybe you could provide a little bit more details on what you\u2019re thinking around IDFA. Is it actually affecting, targeting? And how do you think about some of the workarounds you\u2019re seeing or you\u2019re implementing so far? Thank you.\nJeremi Gorman: Yes. Sure. Thank you for the question. So I think when we\u2019re kind of talking specifically about what drove the success, this is my favorite question. So I\u2019m excited that you asked that. Thank you. It was really broad-based across all of our sectors as well as our regions. So when we look at different areas of success, when you take vertical by vertical by vertical, we had a lot of success in areas where we\u2019ve seen that type of acceleration during lockdowns, like streaming for instance. But then as the world started to reopen a bit, we also started to see success in areas like retail and restaurants, and a little bit of life back into the travel sector, which has been nice and exciting as well. I will let Derek talk to anything specific that was kind of made June related if he\u2019d like, but I can also take the IDFA question. I think the important thing about IDFA is to really understand that the solutions are not yet fully finalized. Everyone is still evolving, Apple, the entire industry is still evolving. And we\u2019ve said this before, and I just want to reiterate that we genuinely support Apple\u2019s approach. We\u2019ve always believed that advertising should respect customer\u2019s privacy and it\u2019s core at Snap than the product set. This amazing team has built for the last almost 10 years now and we\u2019ve been working really hard to make this transition smooth for our advertising partners, as well as our businesses. So where we are in the cycle right now is that we\u2019ve rolled out full support of SKAdNetwork 3.0, which we know will aid or what we believe will aid an attribution for advertisers. And we\u2019ve also implemented Apple\u2019s API. In addition, we launched Advanced Conversions in Ad Manager. So advertisers can measure their campaigns with our privacy conscious measurement stack. And then, I think one of the things that we are \u2013 whether we\u2019re observing here is that our opt-in rates have been above what is sort of widely reported in both the press as well as with the analyst community. So that\u2019s been good, but it remains so early in these iOS changes. And there\u2019s no question that it will be a change for the industry in and of itself. But I think we prepared the best that we can. The product teams and engineering teams have been working really closely with all of our partners and our sales teams to make sure that this transition for our advertisers is as smooth as possible.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session as well as Snap, Inc. second quarter 2021 earnings conference call.

            "name": "Derek Andersen",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeremi. Our Q2 financial results reflect our priorities of growing our community, making focused investments in the future of our business, and scaling our operations efficiently in order to drive towards profitability and positive free cash flow. As Evan mentioned earlier, our community grew to 293 million daily active users in Q2, an increase of 55 million or 23% year-over-year. The growth in our community continues to be broad based, with year-over-year and sequential growth on both iOS and Android platforms. In North America, DAU grew by 5 million or 6% year-over-year to reach 95 million. In Europe, DAU grew by 7 million or 10% year-over-year to reach 78 million. In Rest of World, DAU grew by 43 million or 55% year-over-year to reach 120 million. The continued robust growth in Rest of World reflects the benefit of our ongoing investments in local content, local language support, marketing partnerships, and the popularity of augmented reality Lenses created by our global community. Total revenue for Q2 was $982 million, an increase of 116% year-over-year as we lapped the quarter in the prior year where the pandemic most significantly impacted advertising demand. We benefited from an improved operating environment in Q2 and strong momentum with our advertising products and partners. In addition, the iOS platform policy changes that we anticipated could disrupt advertising demand in Q2 of this year did not materialize as expected in Q2 as the changes were rolled out later and adoption occurred at a slower than expected pace. In North America, revenue grew 129% year-over-year in Q2, while ARPU grew 116% year-over-year as we continue to benefit from the significant investments we made in our sales teams and sales support in the prior year. In Europe, revenue grew 94% year-over-year in Q2, while ARPU grew 76% year-over-year. In rest of world, revenue grew 86% year-over-year in Q2, while ARPU grew 20% year-over-year. As indicated in the prior quarter, we are continuing to accelerate our investments in sales and sales support beyond North America in order to capture our global ARPU opportunity faster in the years ahead. Average eCPM increased 122% year-over-year in Q2. Rising eCPM relative to the prior year reflects the rapid rise in overall demand, improved optimization capabilities within our auction, a mix shift toward relatively higher eCPM products, as well as a mix shift toward relatively higher eCPM regions such as North America. Dynamic Ads are a great example of an ad product where we are seeing the power of product innovation and auction optimization to deliver return on ad spend while achieving relatively higher yields for our inventory with revenue from Dynamic Ads more than doubling sequentially. With the rapid rise in total revenue of 116% year-over-year, and 28% percent sequentially, the rate of growth in demand outpaced the rate of new optimizations delivered in the quarter and we observed sequential increases in cost per action for our goal based bidding products in the quarter as a result. We continue to invest heavily in our teams and tools to continually enhance our optimization capabilities over time and this is a top priority as we seek to deliver attractive returns on advertising spend for our advertising partners over the long term. In addition, the ongoing growth of our community, and strong engagement in areas of our application that we have not yet begun to monetize, provide us with the opportunity to expand our inventory and grow our long-term ARPU opportunity over time. Gross margins were 55% in Q2, an increase of approximately 9 percentage points year-over-year and 8 percentage points sequentially. We continue to make significant progress against our goal of driving down our underlying infrastructure unit costs over time. In Q2, we continued to benefit from several recent efficiency improvements delivered by our engineering teams, as well as negotiated rate improvements for several of our cloud services. In addition, the acceleration in growth of our community has been a modest benefit to infrastructure cost per DAU in recent quarters as new users tend to have lower initial marginal cloud infrastructure costs relative to longer tenured Snapchatters. These factors combined to deliver infrastructure costs per DAU of $0.62 in Q2, which was consistent with the prior quarter and down from $0.69 in the prior year. On the content side, we continued to invest to support the launch of Spotlight in Q2 and this contributed approximately $76 million to our cost of revenue in the quarter, which is a modest sequential decline in cost as we continue to evolve the cost structure for this program to promote more content diversity by rewarding top performing content creators while also seeding new content categories. We are pleased with our progress on this front as we've observed all time highs in daily submissions after making these changes to the incentive program. We also continue to be highly encouraged by the early returns from our investments in Spotlight with daily time spent per user on Spotlight in the U.S. growing more than 60% in the last quarter. While it is still very early for this new platform, we are excited about the potential for Spotlight to further expand our monetization opportunity in the future. We are particularly pleased that we have been able to continue to invest in Spotlight and Discover while expanding our gross margins year-over-year, which reflects our overall approach of scaling our operations efficiently over time, while making investments in the future of our business. Operating expenses were $427 million in Q2, up 39% year-over-year. As we anticipated last quarter, our rate of hiring stepped up in Q2 and the growth in employee related costs was the single largest driver of growth in operating expenses in Q2. Total employee related costs, which represent more than 60% of operating expenses, were up 35% year-over-year driven by a 31% increase in full time headcount that reflects the ongoing investments in our team as well as the integration of recent acquisitions which contributed approximately 8 percentage points to the year-over-year growth in full time headcount in Q2. We have also continued to invest in marketing to build on the momentum we have established with our advertising partners, and in our community, with growth in these investment areas contributing in part to the growth in overall operating costs. As we anticipated last quarter, we are also beginning to see certain costs returning to our cost structure that were significantly diminished due to the pandemic related restrictions over the past year, including travel and event related costs among others. The partial return of these costs to our cost structure in Q2 was an additional factor driving the acceleration in the rate of expense growth in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $117 million in Q2, an improvement of $213 million year-over-year as we continue to grow our topline rapidly while scaling our cost structure efficiently. We delivered adjusted EBITDA leverage of 40% in Q2 as we continue to invest in the future of our business, while making progress toward sustained profitability and positive free cash flow. Net income was negative $152 million in Q2, an improvement of $174 million over the prior year and representing Net income leverage of 33% as we continue to make progress towards achieving profitability and sustained positive free cash flow generation. The year-over-year improvement in net income primarily reflects the flow through of the $213 million improvement in adjusted EBITDA as well as $80 million higher net gains on investments in the quarter. This was partially offset by $88 million higher stock based compensation driven by several factors, including approximately $43 million attributable to growth in our team due to hiring over the past year, $25 million driven by higher payroll taxes due to our higher stock price, and $13 million related to long-term retention associated with several acquisitions completed in the last year. While we have continued to grow our team, and leverage stock-based compensation strategically to foster an ownership culture and drive long-term retention, we have remained focused on managing these programs responsibly. Total fully diluted shares outstanding grew 4% year-over-year in Q2. However, excluding the shares we issued in exchange for early conversion of approximately $840 million of our convertible notes, the rate of growth in shares outstanding was just 1.7% year-over-year, down from 2.6% in the prior quarter, and below the 3% estimate we shared during our recent investor day that was noted to be exclusive of any dilution related to convertible notes. Free cash flow for Q2 was negative $116 million, or $33 million unfavorable versus the prior year. This was driven primarily by a $233 million increase in net working capital driven by the rapid sequential and year-over-year growth in revenue that was partially offset by improvements in our cash conversion cycle, including an approximately 2 day reduction in our days sales outstanding metric, which reflects our broader initiative to scale our operations efficiently. The impact of top line growth on our net working capital position was largely offset by the $213 million improvement in adjusted EBITDA noted earlier. We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, up from $2.8 billion in the prior year, as the proceeds of convertible notes issued over the past year more than offset the investments we have made to grow the business over the past year. As we look forward to Q3, we are observing a resurgence of COVID-19 cases and the ongoing impact of the pandemic around the world, which continues to present an uncertain operating environment. We currently estimate that DAU will grow at a rate of approximately 21% year-over-year, to reach approximately $301 million in Q3. On the monetization side, we note that the comparisons will be more challenging in the second half as we begin to lap the acceleration in top line growth that we experienced in the prior year. Our guidance range is for year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 58% to 60% in Q3. This range reflects our best current estimate of the potential impact of anticipated disruptions associated with the iOS platform changes. As I mentioned earlier, the iOS platform changes have been adopted more slowly than we had anticipated, and the interruptions to demand are therefore expected to come later than we initially anticipated. As a result, it is still not clear what the longer term impact of the iOS platform changes may be, and this may not be clear until at least several months or more after the changes are fully implemented. Until then, we remain focused on helping our partners navigate these changes while optimizing return on ad spend across our advertising products and platform. On the expense side in Q3, we intend to continue to invest in the long-term growth of our business in order to build on the momentum we have established with our community, our partners, and our top line growth. In addition, we expect to continue to see certain costs that were diminished during the pandemic, such as travel and event costs, continue to return to our cost structure in the quarters ahead which will impact operating expense growth. Our estimates for Q3 adjusted EBITDA reflect our revenue guidance and our expected level of investments resulting in a range of $100 million to $120 million for Q3. Thank you for joining our call today. And we will now take your questions. Sure. Doug, it's Derek speaking. I can take that one on the eCPM question. You're right. We pivoted from eCPM in Q2, they were up 122% year-over-year, and we do think of eCPM at least in part is now put metric at this stage in our growth. And we expect that it could fluctuate as our business evolves over time. With that said, in Q2, in particular, we did see rising eCPM is driven by several factors. One of them is just the rapid rise in their overall advertising demand we've experienced, which was up 116% year-over-year successfully. Mix shift towards higher eCPM products is also a factor here such as dynamic ads, the revenue from which doubled sequentially in Q2. And then we do see mixed shift across some regions with North America growing at a relatively higher rate as well. Overtime, however, there are several competing forces, many of which we have influence over that can put downward pressure on eCPM, including, one is the growth in our overall community. And we've seen this accelerated in recent quarters with global DAU reaching 23% growth year-over-year in the most recent quarter. Second, there's the potential to expand our inventory opportunity by expanding commoditization of highly engaged areas within our application. Example, this includes the camera and given that our app opens to the camera, our audience creates billions of snaps per day. The inventory potential of the camera is already immense. So we're investing heavily in our capabilities to capture that opportunity. As you can see with our recent product announcements and acquisitions and so on, Spotlight is another example and it remains early days for this new platform, but where engagement has grown rapidly, and we're excited about the potential for spotlight to expand our ARPU opportunity over time. And the math is another really good similar sort of example, of an entirely new revenue opportunity with very attractive levels of engagement and the opportunity to serve as an on-ramp for a new audience of advertising partners over time. Last but not least, we'd been investing really heavily in our ad products and optimization capabilities in order to deliver our goal based outcomes for advertisers, such as Pixel verified purchases as efficiently as possible, which allows us to expand our inventory opportunity. And then, look, lastly, I hope all of that would give you a little bit of a framework of how we're thinking about this evolving over time as these dynamics play out. So hopefully that gives you a little more context. Thank you. Hey, there, Mark. It's Derek, I'll take the first part of your question on Spotlight, then I'll turn it over to Evan on the other parts of your question. On spotlight in particular, one, we're continuing to improve the experience for our community and for our creators. For viewers, we're adding new features like the training page while improving personalization and ranking in order to show the right content to the right people based on their engagement interests. And for creators, we are making it easier to create compelling content using creator tools and our camera, and we launched Creative Kit for Spotlight so the creators can easily create and submit videos to Spotlight from applications like Voisey and so on. We're really excited about the momentum we're seeing on Spotlight, submissions have tripled sequentially. We're also seeing positive engagement trends with 49% sequential increase in DAU. We're also seeing time spent growing rapidly with daily time spent per user on Spotlight in the U.S. growing more than 60% in the last quarter. On the creator front in the level of investment, we remain dedicated to rewarding our community for what they contribute to Spotlight. We have evolved the creator fund in the most recent quarter in order to continue to reward top creators, while also seeding new content categories. And we're pleased with what we're seeing in the results of that so far, we made over the last quarter is we've observed all time highs in daily submissions to Spotlight after making these changes. We're still very early on in this journey though, we're excited about our ongoing work with Spotlight to help our community discover new content and new creators, while also supporting our global creator community. On the monetization side of that, it's very early and we don't feel pressure to do that at this time. But hopefully that gives you a little bit of a sense of where we are on Spotlight and our commitment to investing in that product over time. I'll turn it over to Evan to handle the next parts of your question there."

            "name": "Jeremi Gorman",
            "content": "Thanks, Evan. We're pleased with our results this quarter and believe our business is well-positioned for the future. In Q2, we generated total revenue of $982 million, an increase of 116% year-over-year, reflecting the momentum in our advertising business and the hard work of our team serving our partners and helping them generate return on their investment. We benefited from a favourable operating environment and continued success with both direct response and large brand advertisers, and we continue to leverage our performant ad products to grow our advertiser base globally. We are fully focused on making progress against our revenue and ARPU opportunities, which we believe will be driven by three key priorities. First, driving ROI through measurement, ranking, and optimization, second, investing in our sales and marketing functions by continuing to train, hire and build for scale and third, building innovative ad experiences around video and augmented reality, with a focus on shopping and commerce. Our commitment to these three priorities, along with our unique reach and large, engaged community, allows us to drive performance at scale for businesses around the world. We believe all advertisers optimize for driving ROI and measuring performance. We have accelerated our efforts to drive ROI for our advertising partners via lower-funnel bidding capabilities, which allow advertisers to optimize for the objectives they are trying to achieve, and our innovative ad units, which are tailored for the most sophisticated performance advertisers. For example, Booking.com employed a strategy that used Dynamic Ads to reach new customers on Snapchat. By utilizing our Dynamic Ad solution for travel, they were able to dynamically pull images directly from their product catalog that displayed relevant and visually appealing destination photos and features. This helped Booking.com unlock an incremental audience within the United States, which resulted in a positive incremental lift in bookings across both their website and their app, and delivered a cost per incremental booking of approximately 36% lower than their goal. Our ad platform is being utilized as an effective self-service tool to help advertisers of all types and sizes create, manage, and measure campaigns on Snapchat. Further, it is a reflection of our focus on privacy and innovation as we are delivering results for advertisers, while also respecting the privacy of our community, which has been a core tenet since we launched ads on Snapchat. This year has clearly demonstrated how important it is to simultaneously meet these two objectives for our advertising partners. As Apple rolled-out its App Tracking Transparency-related changes near the end of Q2, we observed higher opt-in rates than we are seeing reported generally across the industry, which we believe is due in part to the trust our community has in our products and our business. Apple's rollout of the most recent iOS update came later in Q2 than initially anticipated, and the pace of updates by iPhone users has also been slower than we anticipated. This has given us more time with advertisers to navigate the transition but also means the effects of these changes will come later than we initially expected. We continue to work with our advertising partners on privacy-safe solutions and other attribution techniques. For example, we fully rolled out support of SKAdnetwork version 3.0, which we believe will aid in improving attribution for advertisers who have implemented Apple's API. We also launched Advanced Conversions in Ads Manager, which allows advertisers to measure their campaigns via our privacy-protecting measurement stack. We are dedicated to delivering value for our advertising partners while respecting the privacy of our community, as we have worked to do for many years. That said, it remains very early in the adoption of the iOS platform changes, and we will continue to learn how these changes may impact our advertising partners, business, and the industry as a whole. We are seeing some initial signals as advertisers test and learn in this new environment and this is causing some interruptions to demand that we had anticipated would be part of the adoption process, particularly in the direct response e-commerce and gaming sectors. It is too early to determine how long it will take until these changes are fully adopted, the scale of the potential interruptions to demand, or the ultimate impact on the longer term growth of our business. We have proven through our efforts in North America that with a robust team, surrounding resources, and a local focus, we can accelerate revenue. We are now taking that model and replicating it in several markets that we have identified as having a large digital advertising market and significant levels of existing Snapchat adoption. We have a lot of room to grow in some of the world's most established ad markets outside of North America, especially in Europe. For example, in the UK, France, and the Netherlands, we reach over 90% of 13 to 24 year olds and 75% of 13 to 34 year olds. We will continue to make progress on hiring and investing in our team globally across sales, marketing, and partnerships, among many others, as we believe this investment will position us well to grow our business over the long-term. We continue to invest heavily in video advertising, with the goal of driving results for our advertising partners and connecting them to the Snapchat Generation. For example, we worked with Nielsen to help U.S. advertisers understand how to more efficiently reach their target audiences via Snap Ads. The total ad ratings study analyzed how over 30 cross-platform advertising campaigns reached people on both Snapchat and television. The analysis showed that Snapchat campaigns contributed an average of 16% incremental reach to advertisers' target audiences, and over 70% percent of the Gen Z audience that was reached by Snapchat was not reached by TV-only campaigns. This is especially important as people are increasingly cutting the cord, and mobile content consumption continues to grow, presenting us with a large opportunity to help advertisers reach the Snapchat Generation at scale. Augmented reality advertising is delivering a return on investment that is measurable and repeatable, which is encouraging more and more businesses to invest in AR. For example, Smile Direct Club leveraged our Goal-Based Bidding Click optimization for AR, which drove 49% of Snap customer leads in Q2 and was the most effective ad unit at driving traffic for their business compared to other social channels. The success of the Lens ultimately encouraged Smile Direct Club to include AR Lenses as part of their long-term business strategy. We are doubling down on our efforts to help advertisers improve conversions and ROI, and recently launched our GBB Purchase optimization for AR, which allows advertisers to optimize their AR campaigns for down-funnel purchases and fits well into our shopping strategy. We continue to roll out a number of products and features to help empower AR commerce on Snapchat. We recently launched Public Profiles for all businesses, which give businesses of all sizes a free, permanent home on Snapchat where they can highlight engaging content, showcase compelling AR experiences even after a campaign is finished, and share shoppable products directly within the app. Public Profiles allow brands to build a direct relationship with our community, and we are already seeing some of the largest brands investing in their profile. For example, Nike leveraged our AR Lenses as part of its Play New campaign to encourage Snapchatters to get active, and the company is planning to build additional Lenses for its Public Profile. In addition, at our Partner Summit in May we launched unique new try-on capabilities, such as wrist tracking technology for watches and jewelry, and TrueSize technology for eyewear, which complement our existing foot tracking technology, and are all designed to give Snapchatters more confidence in the ability for AR try-on to emulate a physical shopping experience. For example, watchmaker Piaget is using wrist tracking technology to make it possible to try on a variety of different timepieces, and businesses like Zenni Optical are using our TrueSize technology to help Snapchatters find frames that fit them perfectly. Through new 3D body mesh capabilities, retailers now have the ability to showcase products realistically on the body. This has come to life for brands like Prada that created a bag try-on experience for Snapchatters to shop directly in the camera. Additionally, brands like Farfetch are tapping into these technologies to allow our community to try on and shop a variety of jackets from its catalog. All of these technologies and more are available in Lens Studio for the world's leading creators and agencies to build for brands. We also recently built a new AR beauty template in Lens Web Builder, which allows beauty brands to upload their entire catalog and publish AR Lenses quickly and in a cost effective manner. For example, e.l.f. Cosmetics is able to pull in many of their 800 product SKUs to create unique makeup try-on experiences; and with the Lenses they've built thus far, are already seeing Snapchatters engage with their products in new ways. We are in the process of onboarding hundreds of emerging Gen Z-focused beauty brands who will be able to leverage this technology for their AR campaigns. We have a lot more work ahead to build out our technology and increase AR adoption, but we are thrilled with the results that our partners are seeing as we invest in our long-term camera opportunity. When brands utilize a portfolio approach of combining sponsored AR Lenses with Snap Ads, they result in higher ROI and lower costs per outcome. For example, global sports streaming service DAZN launched a multi-product campaign that utilized AR Lenses, Snap Ads, Story Ads and Commercials in order to drive awareness for its live sports channels, installs for its app, and subscriptions for its streaming service. DAZN leveraged our new GBB App Install optimization for AR, which not only drove incremental installs, but also reached millions of unique Snapchatters. The overall campaign resulted in lifts and installs in subscriptions and drove incremental Snapchatters to its platform, ultimately reinforcing the value of leveraging our ad formats together to drive performance and ROI. We will continue to invest for the long-term by demonstrating measurable ROI for our advertising partners, providing support through our sales and marketing functions, and leading the way with innovative advertising products and services to help advertisers scale. We are confident in our long-term opportunity, and are excited to double down on shopping and commerce via augmented reality. Given our community, their depth of engagement on our platform, and our overall opportunity to take share of the growing digital advertising market, we believe we are well positioned to drive business results for advertisers over the long-term. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Derek. Brian, thanks so much for the question. We're really happy actually with the products across the board and the adoption. So as Derek spoke to, we've seen a robust increase in just overall demands of our innovative ad formats and improve self-service model, which has very much enabled us to scale demand globally. And to be specific about your question and the products that we released over the last three years that continue to see strong growth, it's really in dynamic ads, down-funnel GBB as examples, being Pixel Purchase and ad purchase, commercials and shows and games, and then in self-service AR as well. So again, kind of runs the gamut there, but additionally, we continue to invest in ads, measurement and optimization, which is the most important thing for us because it helps us derive outcomes more efficiently and increase yield, but also increase performance for our advertisers. This particular flywheel is why we're so excited about our future potential across all of these products as we scale our advertising business. And I will let Evan take the second part. Hi, Rich. Thanks for the great questions as always. I will take the small, medium business question. So specifically as it pertains to small and medium businesses, I think one of the things that can kind of get completed is that talking about local or is that talking about e-commerce and app install, et cetera. So I'll give you an answer kind of in two parts there. But the first is really the small and medium businesses as it pertains to app install and e-commerce, so digitally native businesses to be specific. We believe that we already have a lot of the tools focused on measurement ROI that flywheel, that we've talked about in the last question, in terms of optimization and ensuring that people get results when they use things like our goal based bidding strategies. And those products are already in place, but we believe that we have a significant opportunity with a smaller growing companies in a particular space. And then looking longer term, we believe that the Snap Map and public profiles for businesses will be really key features to unlock growth in the local SMB space different than that e-comm and the app install businesses, but we're still really, really early on in this particular journey. The good news is though that Snapchatters are starting to interact with local businesses organically on the service. So as we improve the utility of those core services, we're going to be investing in more local specific advertising products, but we're not there yet. So that's what you should be looking for. Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. This is Jeremi, appreciate it. As Evan mentioned, we really think that the shift towards e-commerce is a long-term secular trend, and we know that AR can play a really pivotal role in improving the e-commerce experience for shoppers that's beneficial to both the retailer and the customer. We've talked a little bit about this in past calls, but when you take a look at the trends that accelerated during lockdowns, it was really an interesting period of time because we had a lot of people in the Snapchat community that are fully engaged in AR, 200 million people engaging in AR every single day. And brands really needed to find a replacement for malls and for showrooms and these kinds of things, which accelerated the trends in AR. We don't look at it as necessarily one specific destination on Snapchat where people can go and experience AR or brands can have a presence, but rather the AR shopping and its entirety is a huge focus for us. But we're also looking at commerce and shopping is the type of experience that can be threaded throughout the service. So not like a specific destination, although of course, that will be available on public profiles as well. But we've experimented with shopping, to be a screen shop, native commerce for publishers and creators and discover, and even scan to shop with our Amazon partnership that we launched a few years ago. We work with advertisers all the time, spend a lot of time with them, and they consistently tell us that Snapchat and talking with their best friends comes up as a really important part of the shopping experience. When you think of kind of the evergreen question that's been going on for years, does this look good on me? Imagine how much more effective that is in AR without having to buy something or return it later. And we're going to look to leverage those close friends, that type of sentiment as we leave shopping experiences throughout the Snapchat service in just a really natural and engaging way. Yes. Sure. Thank you for the question. So I think when we're kind of talking specifically about what drove the success, this is my favorite question. So I'm excited that you asked that. Thank you. It was really broad-based across all of our sectors as well as our regions. So when we look at different areas of success, when you take vertical by vertical by vertical, we had a lot of success in areas where we've seen that type of acceleration during lockdowns, like streaming for instance. But then as the world started to reopen a bit, we also started to see success in areas like retail and restaurants, and a little bit of life back into the travel sector, which has been nice and exciting as well. I will let Derek talk to anything specific that was kind of made June related if he'd like, but I can also take the IDFA question. I think the important thing about IDFA is to really understand that the solutions are not yet fully finalized. Everyone is still evolving, Apple, the entire industry is still evolving. And we've said this before, and I just want to reiterate that we genuinely support Apple's approach. We've always believed that advertising should respect customer's privacy and it's core at Snap than the product set. This amazing team has built for the last almost 10 years now and we've been working really hard to make this transition smooth for our advertising partners, as well as our businesses. So where we are in the cycle right now is that we've rolled out full support of SKAdNetwork 3.0, which we know will aid or what we believe will aid an attribution for advertisers. And we've also implemented Apple's API. In addition, we launched Advanced Conversions in Ad Manager. So advertisers can measure their campaigns with our privacy conscious measurement stack. And then, I think one of the things that we are \u2013 whether we're observing here is that our opt-in rates have been above what is sort of widely reported in both the press as well as with the analyst community. So that's been good, but it remains so early in these iOS changes. And there's no question that it will be a change for the industry in and of itself. But I think we prepared the best that we can. The product teams and engineering teams have been working really closely with all of our partners and our sales teams to make sure that this transition for our advertisers is as smooth as possible."

            "content": "Thank you all for joining us today. Our second quarter results reflect the broad-based strength of our business and the hard work of our team as we execute to serve our community and partners. This quarter we grew both revenue and daily active users at the highest rates we have achieved in the last four years. Daily active users grew 23% year-over-year to 293 million, and we more than doubled revenue year-over-year to $982 million, generating $117 million in adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA improved by $213 million compared to last year, marking our third adjusted EBITDA profitable quarter in the last 12 months as we continue to demonstrate the leverage in our business as we scale. At our annual Partner Summit in May, we introduced new product innovations for our community and partners, including the next generation of Spectacles augmented reality glasses that overlay computing on the world, and we are excited by the tremendous opportunity for our business in 2021 and beyond. We made significant progress with our augmented reality platform this quarter. More than 200 million Snapchatters engage with AR every day on average, and over 200,000 creators use Lens Studio to build AR Lenses for our community. We are focused on learning from our large and engaged community of Snapchatters and creators, which allows us to continually improve our AR Lenses and the tools we provide to create them in Lens Studio. This quarter, our Cartoon 3D Style Lens, which uses machine learning to turn people into a 3D-animated cartoon in real-time, highlighted the power of Lenses to go viral both inside and outside of Snapchat. In the first week of release, it generated 2.8 billion impressions on Snapchat alone. We rolled out Lens Studio 4.0 at our Partner Summit, with new features like visual classification, multiperson 3D body mesh, advanced cloth simulation, TrueSize technology for eyewear try-on, and a new visual effects editor, which enables creators to build sophisticated Lenses without writing any code. We also launched Connected Lenses, which enables real-time shared experiences in augmented reality, like building a LEGO model together with your friends. We are continuing to create value for businesses by reimagining the shopping experience through AR. By leveraging the long-term investments we've made in augmented reality and personalization, we are laying the groundwork for an improved online shopping experience. For example, we are making it easier to discover new fashion items through Scan by helping Snapchatters scan a friend's outfit, or a saved photo or screenshot, to shop similar looks and recommendations. When it comes to purchases and returns, we believe that helping people find the right size and improving the try-on experience could both increase conversion rates for purchases as well as reduce the rate of returns for online shopping. We are excited about this opportunity because returned goods cost businesses hundreds of billions of dollars each year, and have a large environmental impact. We are pleased with our early progress in this space, and look forward to experimenting and learning more with our retail and e-commerce partners. We are also collaborating with a variety of partners to power AR experiences in their own applications with Camera Kit, which brings the power of the Snapchat camera to partner applications using our SDK. This quarter, we rolled out a number of Camera Kit partnerships worldwide, including with Walt Disney World. We'll commemorate their 50th anniversary with an AR experience where visitors can place their own picture on Cinderella's Castle to create a virtual mosaic of shared moments, as well as access exclusive AR Lenses with Disney characters through the My Disney Experience app. We also partnered with Bumble and Viber to bring Lenses to their respective mobile apps, and are working with Google to bring our Lenses directly to the new JioPhone in India with a native camera integration. We announced our next generation of Spectacles at our Partner Summit, which are available exclusively for creators. They are our first device with a built-in 3D augmented reality display, and represent another step forward toward our goal of overlaying computing on the world. We are investing heavily in augmented reality across Snapchat, Camera Kit, and Spectacles, and we are excited to continue learning and making progress toward our long-term vision. We also announced a number of new products and partnerships at our Partner Summit for Maps, Minis, and Games. We are adding Layers to the Snap Map, so that Snapchatters can find personalized local experiences from our partners overlaid directly on the Map. For example, users will be able to see restaurant recommendations from The Infatuation or their own saved Snaps from Memories on the Map. We are also expanding our Minis platform, including a new Mini featuring daily shopping events hosted by Poshmark. Ticketmaster is partnering with us across a few of these products, with a Mini where you and your friends can discover different artists and shows and buy tickets, which also integrates directly with the Ticketmaster Layer on our Map that overlays different concerts and events directly on the Snap Map. We are adding new titles and genres to Snap Games, with Voodoo launching five new games to Snapchat this year. We have learned that players who use their Bitmoji in a game spend twice as much time playing, which is one reason Unity is bringing 3D Bitmoji into their mobile, PC and console games with our new Unity plugin. We have observed a number of changes in content engagement as we evolve our content products and manage through the mixed impacts of the pandemic. For example, global time spent watching content on Snap grew year-over-year, while lapping the boost in engagement we saw at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, but we have also observed a year-over-year decrease in daily time spent watching user-generated Stories created by friends, even as the number of daily viewers of that content has grown year-over-year. We believe this is due in part to a decline in the volume of daily Story posting activity on Snapchat coinciding with mobility restrictions and behaviors related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduces the amount of content created by friends that is available to watch. While it is unclear when these restrictions will end and how user behavior will evolve, we are seeing stabilization and early recovery in Story posting as some communities are reopening and reducing restrictions, and we are cautiously optimistic that this will lead to increased time spent watching Stories from friends as the world begins to open up. Meanwhile, we are continuing to evolve our overall content products and business. As we learn more about the different types of content that our community wants to watch and that drive successful outcomes for our partners, we are doubling down on what is working well. Based on these learnings, we are adapting and expanding our content offerings from both our media partners and our creator community in order to appeal to the diverse variety of interests of our community. For example, Shows are seeing ongoing success on our platform, and we aired eight new Snap Original Shows this quarter. Many of our partners reach a broad audience through several different channels, and nine different partners reached more than 30 million unique Snapchatters in the United States alone. We added 177 new international Discover channels this quarter to support our international growth strategy and deepen engagement. For example, total daily time spent by Snapchatters in India watching Shows and publisher content increased by 150% year-over-year. Additionally, we are seeing early promise in showcasing the best and most entertaining Snaps from our community on Spotlight. While we are still in the early phases of launch and iteration, we are excited about our learnings and progress so far. Engagement is growing rapidly as we roll out Spotlight worldwide, with Spotlight DAU growing 49% quarter-over-quarter, and average daily content submissions more than tripling when compared to the prior quarter. We are also seeing time spent growing rapidly, with daily time spent per user on Spotlight in the United States growing more than 60% in the last quarter, giving us additional confidence in our ability to build Spotlight into a meaningful business over time. There is still a lot of work to do as we build out Spotlight and innovate to improve the product experience. For viewers, we are adding new features like the Trending Page, while improving personalization and ranking, in order to show the right content to the right people based on their engagement and interests. For creators, we are making it easier to create compelling content using creative tools in our camera, and we launched Creative Kit for Spotlight so that creators can easily create and submit videos to Spotlight from applications like Voisey, Beat Leap, and Video Leap. We signed deals with Universal Music Group, Sony ATV and DistroKid in the first half of 2021 to increase the availability of Sounds on our platform and to help our community discover new artists. We are also helping creators monetize and develop relationships with members of our community through products like Gifting, our Creator Marketplace, and by supporting them directly through our Creator Fund, which we are continuing to evolve as we move beyond our initial launch. While we are still very early on this journey, we are excited about our ongoing work with Spotlight to help our community discover new content and creators while also supporting our global creator community. We've now spent over a year working from home, and we have learned so much as a team about how to execute remotely while continuing to deliver rapid product innovation. While we are excited to see each other in person after all this time, we are also planning to retain many of the behaviors and practices we developed during the pandemic so that we can continue benefiting from the flexibility of being able to work and collaborate remotely. This new way of working has brought us closer together as a team and helped us to work more effectively as a global business with team members and partners located around the world. I am deeply grateful for the resilience of our team during such a difficult period, and I am optimistic about the progress we are continuing to make in growing our company. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jeremi to share more about our business. Brian, Thanks for the question. We're super excited about AR shopping. In particular, we're focused on apparel and accessories. It's obviously a huge spending category for young people, but more importantly, it's a real opportunity for us to differentiate. So if you think about the in-store experience in a changing room, that's not particularly pleasant and at home trying to shop online and find the right size and scroll through thousands of little tiles, models were in clothing. None of those feel personal and none of them really capture the experience of trying something on, which is so important for consideration with apparel and accessories. So AR can really solve this problem in an interesting way. There are some places where I think from a product perspective, we have solved the technical challenge. So trying on a pair of shoes or a watch, sunglasses, those are all areas where today we see really great results for retailers and that's where we're focused on scaling. So helping people create and manage their 3D models and make sure that they can easily turn them into lenses. And then there are other problems that we're still working on solving. So for example, trying on a T-shirt and making sure the cost looks really realistic and drapes over your shoulders in the right way, that's much more complicated to do from a technical perspective and we're making good progress there, but it's not perfect yet. So I'd say, what we've tried to do is focus on the areas where we've got a great technical solution and the product works and delivers results. And of course, brands we're seeing success with the lenses that they're creating. And then we're making much longer-term investments with things like fit analytics to find the right fit and the right size with all of our efforts around clothing try-on. And we released some really great new features in Lens Studio 4.0 recently that that helped get us part of the way there. But it may take a little longer for full on apparel trial. But nevertheless, we think AR is going to play a really important role. There's lots of stuff we can do to scale today, and you may have seen some of our efforts to make our beauty AR Lenses more scalable. So that we can ingest someone's entire catalog of beauty skews and help people try them on really easily through Lens web builder, so a lot of efforts to reduce friction and make it easier to scale, and then a lot of really exciting technical and product opportunities for the future. Hey, Rich, thanks for the great question. Yes. As you pointed out, we really pioneered that vertical video format with stories and of course now use that format in Spotlight. And so it's something that I think will transition to monetization really easily. And of course leverage our full ad stack and all of the optimizations and measurement capabilities that we offer today. We've done some small testing with advertising in Spotlight, so that we're ready when we want to turn on. But for now, we're just really focused on the core experience. There's so much opportunity there. We've got a great roadmap of improvements. And we just don't want the team to get distracted frankly with monetization at this point, when there's so much upside in the core user experience and core user engagement. So we've chosen to focus on the product experience for now and then over time we'll think about monetization, but we're testing and learning, so we're ready when the time comes. And then when it comes to Story Studio, I'm so glad you asked this question. It's something we're really excited about. If you think about the core Snapchat camera, we're always optimizing around communication. So we wanted to work really, really quickly. And oftentimes that means we don't offer some of the more sophisticated creative tools that you might want to use when you're making the perfect video and maybe you want to spend 20 minutes really perfecting the transitions and the text overlays and the audio and things like that. And so what we wanted to do is create a separate application, Story Studio to really focus on some of those more fine grain editing use cases to help people make really beautiful videos. And we think they're going to use them in a bunch of different ways after they create them, of course, contributing them to the Spotlight or even to make stories for discover. So we don't know what folks will make yet, but it is a really great opportunity for trust to invest in great creative tools. And over time, we may invent new creative tools in Story Studio and bring them over to Snapchat. So it's a great new way to experiment with video editing and we're really excited to get it out there. Hey, Ross, thanks for the question. I think the best way to think about Spotlight's not going to be purely incremental, but so far what we've seen is that it's largely incremental. And the reason why we think that is because Spotlight and Discover, in our stories products are really different purposes. So what we're seeing as a Spotlight is a great way to discover new content to find creators you've never heard of before or even someone who just submitted a really funny snap that they created. And then Stories is a much more high intent product. So people make friends and want to see exactly what their friends are up to or they've subscribed to their favorite publishers. And so what we're really interested in over time is actually the relationship between the two. So people might discover new influencers, new creators and Spotlight add them and then go view them on Discover. So I think you're right, it's not going to be purely incremental, but so far it has been largely incremental. And we're really excited about the long-term opportunity for us to evolve the relationship between the two. So Spotlight is really opened up a whole new canvas for us to explore this way of distributing content and actually help people find things, frankly, are pretty hard to find today on the Stories page. Hey, Mark. Thanks for the questions. Two things, I love talking about. With Maps, we're really focused on the product opportunity and just continuing to evolve the platform. We see this as a huge long-term opportunity. And so it's just critical that we remain focused on delivering value to the people that use our Map. It started out with answering basic questions, like, what are my friends up to. Where are they? Or are they on their way home yet? And now has evolved to really show people what's happening around them, and of course, most recently with our Map layers really to even find events nearby or restaurant recommendations. And so what we're going to focus on now is expanding that functionality to more partners, making the Map, much, much richer in terms of its content and then doing an even better job personalizing. So over time, of course, we're going to have to filter through all the possible layers that you could engage with on the Snap Map and really find the relevant concerts or restaurants, or local parks that maybe are most interesting or important for you. So the big focus right now is, is continuing to evolve people's relationships with the places around them. We've also released some really cool products that will allow people to favorite places or find ones that are popular with their friends. And so we're just focused on growing that engagement. And then, of course over time, we think we can provide a lot of organic value to local businesses, help show them, who their customers are, how frequently they visit, help them understand foot traffic trends. And of course, eventually help them market to reach their local customer. So that's definitely an exciting opportunity for us, but it's really important that we focus on the core of that product opportunity, because it's a really big one and something that we're really excited about. And then as it comes to augmented reality, we're really excited about the potential for AR mostly because it makes computing much more human. It's overlaid on the world around you, you don't have to look down. At a tiny screen, you can look up and be immersed in a computing experience. But that said, I don't think it's a replacement at all for existing computing devices, which frankly are much more oriented around information retrieval and information organization. And I think what we're going to see instead is that augmented reality is much more oriented around human experiences. And so whether that's more recently we did a partnership with LACMA to create new monuments in Los Angeles, or learning about the world and walking through the solar system to see what it looks like. And of course, many of the other lenses we referenced earlier around commerce and try on, I think augmented reality can provide a totally new way to interact with computing that's experiential and very different than the way that we interact with computing today. So I don't think it will be a replacement. But I certainly think it's an exciting way to experience the world. And that's why we're investing so heavily, of course, in the near-term, on smartphone augmented reality, but then in the longer-term as well with wearable AR, which is something we're really excited about."

We began 2021 by achieving our highest year-over-year revenue and daily active user growth rates in over three years during the quarter, and delivering positive free cash flow for the first time as a public company. We grew revenue 66 % year-over-year to $770 million, grew daily active users 22% year-over-year to 280 million, and generated $126 million in free cash flow. The strength of our business underscores our relentless focus on product innovation and our team's ability to execute well together over the long term. This momentum has also enabled us to increase our investments in product innovation and the longer-term future of our business. In addition to expanding our global community and growing our advertising business, we are also focused on improving our augmented reality capabilities and building on the early momentum we are seeing with Spotlight. We are thrilled with the progress we are seeing in these areas, and look forward to accelerating our efforts going forward. We added 15 million daily active users in Q1. A lot of this growth has been unlocked through our ongoing investments in improving the performance and stability of our products across a wide variety of regions and devices. The vast majority of smartphones in the world are powered by Android, and our Android user base is now larger than our iOS user base, a critical milestone that reflects the long-term value of the investment we made to rebuild our Android application. Furthermore, as our user base continues to grow outside the United States, we are evolving our team and operations to be able to more nimbly and effectively support our global community. These efforts range from region-specific performance improvements of our underlying service to the localization of content, creative tools, and language support. We launched our first local-market Snap Original this March with Phone Swap India, and are dramatically expanding our partnerships and sales efforts to support new geographies where we are seeing increasing traction with our community. These efforts have helped drive steady and healthy growth around the world, with our daily active user base outside of North America and Europe now being our largest community. Additionally, we are optimistic about the engagement trends we are seeing as the world is beginning to open up. As things began to open up in the United States in late February, we saw inflection points in key behaviors like story posting and engagement with the Snap Map. More recently, we saw a rise in the rate of new friendships and bi-directional communication on Snapchat in late March, as people have begun to socialize in broader groups. We designed Snapchat to be a useful complement to real-life friendships, and are excited about these optimistic trends developing with our audience. Augmented reality remains one of our biggest opportunities as we look to the future, and we are investing heavily in both core technology and the community-facing AR experiences on our service. The number of Snapchatters engaging daily with our augmented reality Lenses grew more than 40% year-over-year in Q1, outpacing our daily active user growth by more than 80% as people interact more with augmented reality on Snapchat. A lot of this growth has been driven by the incredible creativity of our community. This quarter, Lenses created by our community accounted for more than half of all Lens views. We have also been expanding the capabilities of Lens Studio, where we continue to put powerful technology into the hands of creators to make more compelling experiences, such as Andre Pappas, who leveraged our machine learning platform to create a viral beard removal Lens. We are now bringing our AR platform to cameras beyond Snapchat through Camera Kit. Over the years, we have invested deeply in both our fundamental technology platform and the creativity of our community and partners to make augmented reality a daily activity for over 200 million people around the world. While we are continuing to invest in improving our technology and growing our community on Snapchat, we believe that expanding the number of places where people can interact with these AR experiences is an opportunity to grow the overall augmented reality ecosystem. We are excited to expand our AR capabilities to the Samsung native camera on the latest Galaxy A series, which extends the reach of Lenses to a much larger global audience and complements our existing Bitmoji integration with the Samsung native keyboard. We believe that our leadership in both AR capabilities and user engagement positions us well to expand augmented reality to new use cases and behaviors. For example, as the shift to online shopping continues to accelerate, we believe there is a massive untapped opportunity for AR-driven product innovation in e-commerce, and that our young audience will continue to be early adopters of these new technologies and shopping experiences. One of the key verticals we are tailoring our solutions for is apparel and accessories, which is the largest shopping category by far among US teenagers. We believe that helping buyers find the right size, fit, and styles will reduce friction in their online shopping experience, which in turn will improve revenue and margins for our business partners while reducing the waste generated from returns. This is just one example among a variety of behaviors and use cases we believe we can support through our augmented reality platform. We are also focusing on our ongoing rollout of Spotlight, which is gaining traction as we improve the experience for our community and creators. We launched Spotlight in India, Mexico, and Brazil during Q1, and are now live in over a dozen countries, reaching more than 125 million monthly active users on Spotlight in March. We are also seeing healthy increases in engagement across both creation and consumption on the platform. For example, daily video submissions have increased by over 40% from January to March, while the number of viewers watching Spotlight for at least 10 minutes per day grew by over 70%. We are also continuing to evolve the product itself. We recently launched Public Profiles for our entire community, made improvements to ranking, and are seeing rapid adoption of our Sounds feature as we continue to expand our music library available on Snapchat. Meanwhile, we continue to see healthy growth in viewership of shows on Discover, which has become a go-to destination for credible and entertaining content for our community. We added over 300 new channels in Q1, including Ryan Doesn't Know, a new Snap Original show starring Ryan Reynolds, which reached over 20 million viewers. This has helped us deepen our content offerings in genres that matter to our audience, including news, sports, entertainment, and beauty. For example, we now have over 75 million Snapchatters watching beauty content and over 85 million Snapchatters watching sports content each month on average on Discover. Nearly every aspect of our service, including each of the five screens of Snapchat, is supported by our partners, and we believe that working together we can offer the best and most innovative user experiences for our community. We have been working hard to improve our platform offering for our partners and to help them grow their businesses. For example, we more than doubled the revenue for our gaming partners over the past year, as we continue to work closely toward launching new titles. Meanwhile, we are thrilled to see early progress as we continue to test Business Profiles with partners like L'Oreal and Zenni Optical, using them as an organic digital showroom of their AR Try-On Lenses. We are also expanding the reach of Lens Studio through partners like Moj, one of India's top short video apps to leverage our augmented reality platform by implementing CameraKit in their own application. We have more to announce about these partnerships at our Snap Partner Summit on May 20, which will be broadcast on snappartnersummit.com. We are so excited to celebrate our partners and share more around what we've been working on together. We are excited to see our long-term investments in our advertising business begin to pay off as we deliver higher ROI to advertisers. We still have a lot of upside in terms of the level of optimization and efficiency that we can deliver, and are investing heavily across the board to both improve our ad platform and support our growing global advertiser base. This has developed into a positive flywheel where our improved efficiency has driven more advertisers and larger budgets to our platform, leading to more impressions and learnings, which in turn increases the rate at which we are able to further improve efficiency and ROI. Furthermore, we believe that our philosophy and early investments in building a business that is thoughtful about the privacy and the trust of our community positions us well, as the overall digital advertising industry continues to move in that direction. While there are, of course, a lot of unknowns to figure out along the way, we are excited to work together with our advertising partners to innovate together toward our vision for protecting user privacy while delivering great business results. It has now been over a year since we have been working from home and I am so proud of what our team has accomplished over this period. Furthermore, our financial performance has enabled us to increase our investments in growth and innovation, which positions us well for the future. We are extremely excited and optimistic about our ability to execute against our long-term goals, especially as we look toward working together and serving our community in a post-pandemic world. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeremi to share more about our business.\nJeremi Gorman: Thanks, Evan. We were pleased with our results this quarter and we continue to make progress against the many opportunities we have to support our community and our advertising partners globally. In Q1, we generated total revenue of $770 million, growing 66% year-over-year. More advertisers were active on our platform than ever as our active advertiser base approximately doubled year-over-year in Q1. We have a large opportunity to gain share of the global digital ad market, which is $340 billion and growing. To capture this opportunity, we remain focused on our three key priorities. First, investing in our ad platform in order to drive improved relevance and deliver measurable ROI. Second, efficiently scaling our sales and marketing functions to support our advertising partners globally. And third, building innovative ad experiences through video and augmented reality that deliver real business value. Our three priorities, along with our unique reach and growing global audience allow us to drive performance at scale. We believe firmly in performance-driven advertising, and continue to scale our measurement tools and goal-based bidding capabilities that allow advertisers to optimize for the objectives they are trying to achieve. We continue to see over half our revenue come from direct response campaigns. Revenue from our Pixel Purchase GBB was up over three times year-over-year. Revenue from our subscription GBB was also up over three times year-over-year, and revenue from our Pixel Signup GBB nearly doubled year-over-year. We are seeing more and more advertisers leverage our tools to drive measurable returns, and as a result increase spend incrementally. For example, we saw TechStyle leverage Pixel Purchase optimization to drive purchases for its portfolio of direct-to-consumer brands, resulting in an efficient cost per purchase up to 25% below goal in Q1. After seeing these results, they plan to invest more with Snap throughout 2021. This gives us confidence in our ability to grow budgets and increase our share of wallet over time. In addition, as advertiser demand and diversity grow, we can serve more relevant ads to each Snapchatter, leading to improved ROI for our partners. We believe this will help us to quickly and easily onboard many more advertisers while also driving ROI for them as we scale. This has also been accelerated by the improvements we continue to make to our ad products and backend optimization, which have increased the scale at which we're able to deliver results for advertisers. For example, our Dynamic Ads format enables retailers to run e-commerce campaigns on Snapchat that automatically optimizes across their entire catalog. Adidas Canada leveraged our Dynamic Ads as a part of their Always On e-commerce strategy, which resulted in a 4.4 times incremental return on ad spend. We are also committed to working with our advertisers as we navigate the App Tracking Transparency-related changes from Apple. We are supportive of Apple's approach because we have always believed that advertising should respect customers' privacy. The fact that these changes are coming later than we anticipated has provided additional time to adopt Apple's SKAdNetwork and begin implementing and testing with our partners. Advertisers that represent a majority of our direct response advertising revenue have successfully implemented SKAdnetwork for their Snap campaigns. Beyond that, we are currently designing an array of privacy-centric solutions, both short and long-term, to ensure we deliver a privacy-first experience for our community and best-in-class offerings for our partners. Our sales team is finding success across a broad set of verticals. Top-performing verticals in Q1 included e-commerce, retail, entertainment, restaurants, tech, telco, apparel, streaming, gaming, and CPG. For example, Yoplait participated in our CPG Fast Track program to prove short-term sales lift for advertisers who hadn't previously invested with Snapchat. Their campaign leveraged Snap Ads and Lenses, which resulted in new buyers driving nearly 30% of incremental sales, and exposure to their Sponsored Lens driving over 40% of incremental sales. We are also delighted to see some traditionally strong categories return, such as theatrical films, and we're beginning to tackle some large categories in which we're well positioned but haven't previously had a large presence, such as travel and leisure. From a regional perspective, North America represents our largest revenue base, and it's also our fastest growing. We doubled down on our investments in sales and sales support in North America over the past 18 months and we've observed higher growth in this region in recent quarters. We see a lot of opportunity to repeat this effort outside of North America in order to accelerate our growth internationally. As we shared in our recent investor day, we also have a lot of room to grow in some of the world's most established advertising markets outside of North America. For example, in the countries that comprise over half the world's digital ad spend, Snapchat reaches 70% of 13 to 34 year-olds, so we already have deep penetration of critical demographics that our advertising partners are eager to reach in the most important digital ad markets beyond North America. We will be making the investments to capture this opportunity in the coming quarters in order to grow our sales teams and enhance sales support in international markets, and we are excited about the opportunity to accelerate our top line growth in these markets in the years ahead. We continue to invest heavily to grow our video advertising business, which currently represents our largest revenue driver. As mobile content consumption continues to rise, we've seen growing demand for our video ad products such as commercials. A study with IPG Media Lab showed that on Snapchat, the short form six-second ads persuaded more customers to consider purchasing the products featured in the commercials compared to 15-second ads. Another study, produced jointly with Omnicom Media Group, showed that Gen Z and Millennials significantly increased their video consumption in 2020, and say that they spend over one hour per day watching video on social media apps alone. Lastly, our work with brands over the past year has resulted in upfront commitments for our commercials ad format from our brand advertising partners more than tripling year-over-year for 2021. We'll be doubling down on our outreach to video advertisers in just a few weeks when we present at the Annual NewFronts Conference to further capture the opportunity we see in video advertising. During the pandemic, advertisers accelerated their adoption of our AR products to enable product sampling and try-ons, when they were forced to find alternatives to traditional methods. This has accelerated the adoption of these use cases and helped pull forward adoption of AR-driven e-commerce. We are excited about the new ways that our advertising partners will leverage AR as the world re-opens. As Evan mentioned, AR can deliver truly immersive experiences when overlaid on the world around you, and we are eager to continue to innovate as more people get out of the house and begin to explore more places. One of the primary reasons for the acceleration in adoption is because brands have learned how to utilize augmented reality to drive real business results. One of our goals is to combine AR experiences like fit and try-on with personalization and customers' preferences to vastly improve the shopping experience, while driving purchases and reducing returns. We believe we are going after a large opportunity. 94% of people are expecting to use AR for shopping the same or more in 2022 versus 2021, according to a study we commissioned with Deloitte. For example, Dior launched a Lens campaign that enabled Snapchatters to try on six pairs of B27 sneakers through augmented reality. The Lenses were promoted directly in the Lens Carousel within the Snapchat camera and via Snap Ads, with videos showing runway models and users playing with the Lens and encouraging Snapchatters to try on the sneakers, which they could do just by swiping up. The AR Lens that was promoted in our Lens Carousel was well received by Snapchatters and resulted in a 6.2 times return on ad spend. Dior also leveraged their business profile, effectively turning its home on Snapchat into a digital showroom, complete with virtual try-ons at the product's launch. In addition, Zenni Optical sought to engage Snapchatters this Valentine's Day with a Shoppable Lens experience that enabled them to try on and purchase from their large online selection of affordable glasses. The Lens resulted in a significant lift in purchases and drove a 7.9 times return on ad spend. We have a great opportunity to help brands reach their customers in unique and innovative ways while continuing to deliver measurable ROI. Businesses leveraging AR as one component of a larger, multi-product campaign on Snapchat tend to achieve stronger results. For example, The CW's Superman & Lois campaign utilized Snap Ads, commercials, and Lens to generate double-digit lifts in ad awareness and a nine point lift in show awareness. When Snapchatters were exposed to multiple products, show awareness for the campaign increased by 2.7 times. We have a lot more work to do in helping businesses understand the value of our many offerings on Snapchat, but we are thrilled with the early successes that our partners are seeing and we are going to continue to invest in this opportunity. This quarter was a strong start to 2021, as we saw the momentum we built in the back half of last year continue. The amount of money committed via upfronts for 2021 is already more than 50% above the total upfront commitments made in 2020, which is a strong signal that brands and agencies have confidence in our platform, and are committed to working with us in an always-on manner because they value the return on ad spend that they are receiving. Based on the size of our audience, their level of engagement across our service, and our overall opportunity in the growing digital ad market, we are well positioned to play an important role in driving results for our advertising partners across the world. In summary, I couldn't be more excited about the opportunities for our business in 2021 and beyond, and I look forward to sharing progress with you throughout the year. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Derek.\nDerek Andersen: Thanks, Jeremi. Our Q1 financial results reflect our priorities of growing our community, making focused investments in the future of our business, and scaling our operations efficiently in order to drive towards profitability and positive free cash flow. As Evan mentioned earlier, our community grew to 280 million daily active users in Q1, an increase of 51 million or 22% year-over-year. The growth in our community continues to be broad based, with year-over-year and sequential growth on both iOS and Android platforms. In North America, DAU grew by 5 million or 5% year-over-year to reach 93 million. In Europe, DAU grew by 7 million or 9% year-over-year to reach 77 million. In Rest of World, DAU grew by 40 million or 57% year-over-year to reach 111 million. We believe Snapchat is a complement to real friendships, and the easing of COVID-19 related restrictions in many communities was a modest tailwind to engagement, as we moved through Q1 that contributed in part to the growth in our Snapchatter community. The continued robust growth in Rest of World reflects the benefit of our ongoing investments to better serve our community, including investments in local content, local language support, marketing partnerships, and the popularity of augmented reality Lenses created by our community. Total revenue for Q1 was $770 million, an increase of 66% year-over-year, representing a 4 percentage point acceleration over the prior quarter. We benefited from continued improvement in the operating environment in Q1 and strong momentum with our advertising products and partners. In addition, the iOS platform policy changes that we expected could cause interruptions to demand in Q1 did not occur in the quarter, and thus were not a headwind in the period. In North America, revenue grew 75% year-over-year in Q1, while ARPU grew 66% year-over-year, as we continue to benefit from the significant investments we made in our sales teams and sales support in the prior year. In Europe, revenue grew 49% year-over-year in Q1, while ARPU grew 36% year-over-year. In Rest of World, revenue grew 46% year-over-year in Q1, representing a 19 percentage point acceleration in growth over the prior quarter, as we began to see the operating environment recover in this region, which was relatively more impacted by COVID-19 related disruptions to demand in the second half of 2020. As indicated during our recent Investor Day, we are accelerating our investments in sales and sales support beyond North America in 2021 in order to capture our global ARPU opportunity faster in the years ahead. Average eCPM increased 67% year-over-year in Q1. Rising eCPM relative to the prior year is driven by a combination of improved optimization capabilities within our auction, a mix shift toward relatively higher eCPM products such as commercials, as well as a mix shift toward relatively higher eCPM regions such as North America. While our topline has benefited from year-over-year growth in eCPM in recent quarters, the cost per action for our advertising partners declined sequentially for three of our top four goal-based bidding objectives in Q1, as we continue to enhance our optimization capabilities in order to use our inventory more efficiently. Consequently, we believe that we will be able to deliver attractive returns on ad spend to our advertising partners as eCPM grows over the long term. In addition, the ongoing growth of our community and strong engagement in areas of our application that we have not yet begun to monetize, provide significant room to expand our inventory and expand our long-term ARPU opportunity over time. Gross margins were 47% in Q1, an increase of approximately 1 percentage point year-over-year. We continue to make significant progress against our goal of driving down our underlying infrastructure unit costs over time. In Q1, our infrastructure costs per DAU benefited from several factors, with the most significant being efficiency improvements delivered by our engineering teams, including the re-architecture of our messaging platform that we mentioned during our recent Investor Day. In addition, we continued to benefit in Q1 from negotiated rate improvements for several of our cloud services. Lastly, the acceleration in growth of our community has been a modest benefit to infrastructure cost per DAU in recent quarters as new users tend to have lower initial marginal cloud infrastructure costs relative to longer tenured Snapchatters. These factors combined to deliver the lowest infrastructure costs per DAU we have reported as a public company at just $0.62 in Q1, down from $0.69 in the prior quarter and $0.71 in the prior year. On the content side, we continue to invest to support the launch of Spotlight in Q1. And this contributed approximately $90 million to our cost of revenue in the quarter, representing a 12 percentage point headwind to gross margin expansion in the quarter. We are highly encouraged by the early returns from our investments in Spotlight, with this new platform reaching over 125 million monthly active users in March. While it is still very early for this new platform, we are excited about the potential for Spotlight to further expand our monetization opportunity in the future. In addition, we are pleased that we have been able to support the launch of Spotlight while continuing to expand our gross margins year-over-year, which reflects our overall approach of scaling our operations efficiently, while making investments in the future of our business. Operating expenses were $367 million in Q1, up 23% year-over-year. Average full-time headcount grew 19% year-over-year in Q1, as we continue to make focused investments in our monetization and engineering teams. The rate of growth in headcount in Q1 was several percentage points below our operating plan expectations, and we expect this will step up modestly in future quarters as we invest to accelerate our roadmap as discussed at our recent Investor Day. In addition, we continue to grow our investments in marketing in order to build on the momentum we have established with our advertising and Snapchatter communities, and we are pleased with the results we are seeing from these efforts thus far as evidenced by the growth in our active advertiser base and Snapchatter community. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $2 million in Q1, an improvement of $80 million year-over-year as we continue to grow our top line rapidly while scaling our cost structure efficiently. We delivered adjusted EBITDA leverage of 26% in Q1, as we continue to invest in the future of our business while making progress towards sustained profitability and positive free cash flow. Net income was negative $287 million in Q1, an improvement of $19 million over the prior year. The year-over-year improvement in net income primarily reflects the flow-through of the $80 million improvement in adjusted EBITDA and $34 million higher net investment gains versus the prior year due to a combination of realized and unrealized gains on various strategic investments. These favorable impacts were partially offset by $94 million higher stock-based compensation driven by several factors, including approximately $43 million attributable to the 19% growth in headcount and retention of our existing team, approximately $29 million related to payroll taxes on SBC driven by our higher stock price, as well as approximately $19 million driven by higher SBC related to long-term retention associated with several acquisitions completed in the last year. While we have continued to grow our team, and leverage stock-based compensation strategically to foster an ownership culture and drive long-term retention, we have remained focused on managing these programs responsibly. Total fully diluted shares outstanding grew 2.6% year-over-year in Q1, down from 3.4% in the prior quarter and below the 3% estimate we shared during our recent Investor Day. Q1 marked our first-ever quarter of positive free cash flow as a public company at $126 million, an improvement of $131 million year-over-year. The improvement was driven primarily by the $80 million improvement in adjusted EBITDA and an approximately $75 million improvement in net working capital, as we continue to focus on enhancing our cash conversion cycle. This was partially offset by the approximately $29 million increase in SBC-related payroll taxes noted earlier. We ended the quarter with $2.6 billion in cash and marketable securities, up from $2.1 billion in the prior year, as the proceeds of convertible notes issued in Q2 2020 more than offset the investments we have made to grow the business over the past year. As we look forward to Q2, we estimate that DAU will grow at a rate consistent with the prior quarter, or approximately 22% year-over-year to reach $290 million in Q2. On the monetization side, we are cautiously optimistic that the operating environment will continue to improve. Our guidance range is for revenue of $820 million to $840 million, implying year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 80% to 85% in Q2. This range reflects our best current estimate of the potential impact of anticipated disruptions associated with the iOS platform changes. It is not clear yet what the longer-term impact of the iOS platform changes may be for the top line momentum of our business. And this may not be clear until several months or more after the changes are implemented. Until then, we will remain focused on helping our partners navigate these changes while optimizing return on ad spend across our advertising products and platform. On the expense side in Q2, we intend to continue to invest in the long-term growth of our business, and we'll continue to support the launch of Spotlight with our $1 million per day creator fund in order to build on the momentum we are seeing with this exciting new platform. While we see a path to adjusted EBITDA breakeven in Q2, we are also cognizant that there are a number of cost drivers for our business, including travel and event-related costs that have been lower over the past year due to COVID-related restrictions. It is likely that these activities will begin to resume in the coming months as restrictions ease and that the related costs will begin to return to our cost structure as a result. Given this, our guidance range is for adjusted EBITDA to be between negative $20 million and breakeven for Q2. Thank you for joining our call today. And we will now take your questions.\nOperator: That concludes the prepared remarks for today's earnings call. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Richard Greenfield with LightShed. Please go ahead.\nRichard Greenfield: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. First one for Jeremi. Monetization overseas is still at a much earlier stage when you look at your ARPU, yet the past couple of quarters, North America grew far faster than both Europe and Rest of World. You talk about investments, but I guess, what is holding back overseas monetization, just given where the starting point is of ARPU, like what is going to be the trigger for international to grow at a much faster rate year-over-year than - or Europe and Rest of World than North America? Like what do you need to do to make that change? And then just a quick follow-up or a quick question for Evan. There's a lot of kind of noise or chatter about sort of the device side of what Snapchat may or may not be working on. Could you just maybe give us from a very high level, like why is devices something you should be doing given just how successful you've been on the software side of building sort of the app and monetization? Like why is hardware part of what you need to do longer term?\nJeremi Gorman: Hey, Rich. Thanks for the question. You are definitely right that our North America business has been both our largest and our fastest-growing revenue base. I think one of the most exciting things about that is that we have doubled down on the investments in sales and sales support in North America over the past 18 months since verticalization actually, and we've observed higher growth in this region as a result in these recent quarters. We did verticalize our international sales teams. But generally speaking, the sales and sales support teams in our international regions are smaller. So it was more difficult to kind of perfectly execute this verticalization and specialist in terms of different vertical, measurement specialists or marketing specialists or communication specialists by vertical. But I think what's so exciting about the opportunity is that we now know the playbook. You're seeing it show up in our strong results in North America. And so we are going to replicate it in Europe and the rest of the world and those investments we were talking about to accelerate our growth internationally. We talked about this at our recent Investor Day that I know a lot of you are listening to, but we do have so much room to grow in one of the world's - in some of the world's most established advertising markets outside of North America, where we have really strong smartphone penetration. In countries that comprise over half the world's digital ad spend, Snapchat reaches 70% of 13 to 34 year-olds. So, we're already there with deep penetration of critical demographics that our advertising partners are eager to reach. So in 2021, to answer your question, we're going to be making these investments in sales and sales support teams to capture the opportunity, the way that we have in North America in the coming quarters and going to grow those teams to grow top line growth in the years ahead.\nEvan Spiegel: Hey, Rich. Thanks for the question on hardware. I think as we think about the future of augmented reality, really the promise of augmented reality is that you can interact with computing in a way that's similar to how do you interact with the physical world around you. And so I think, ultimately, over a longer period of time, hardware will be a constraint on our ability to fulfill that vision. So today, with your smartphone, you can enjoy augmented reality, but you're limited to this really tiny screen. You have to use the touchscreen. And I think as we think longer term about the future of hardware, there's an opportunity to overlay computing on the world around you in a way that's much more immersive. It allows you to interact with it in terms of using both your hands, having a much - a larger display size in front of you. And I think, as we think about the future of our platform overall, experimenting with hardware informs that software roadmap and helps us think about what we need to be building over the next several years as we work towards this vision, really for a new hardware platform that brings AR to life in a totally different way.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJustin Post: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe one for Evan and one for Derek. Evan, you made some interesting comments on reopening on the call, and we have a survey that says people may use Snap more upon reopening. So maybe you could expand a little bit on what you're seeing in countries or states that are reopening? And what areas of Snap might benefit and maybe where could you see a little less usage? And Derek, the entire DR advertising sector has tougher second half comps. I don't think Snap's alone in that. How would you think about modeling the second half? And could platforms like Spotlight and Maps help on a sequential or a year-over-year basis, if you could turn those on? Thank you.\nEvan Spiegel: Thanks for the question and great to hear about your survey. I guess that lines up definitely with what I've experienced personally during the pandemic. A lot of folks sort of shrunk their social graph. They started talking more to their family members or really close friends. And what we're seeing now in the United States, which is really exciting is that people are going out more and they're seeing more friends or they're returning to school or work. And so their social graph and the people they're interacting with on a regular basis is starting to expand. And that sort of communication with that wider social graph drives a lot of the frequency of use of Snapchat. And then, of course, the conversion then to our other platforms and products that we offer. So, we're super excited that people are out and about and they're taking Snaps with our camera. We mentioned story posting has increased. And we've been investing a ton in the Snap Map. And sadly, over the last year, there hasn't been a lot of reasons to use the Snap Map as everyone's been staying at home. So, we're really excited to see people engaging more with that product and there's a really exciting roadmap there looking forward. So great to see that adoption.\nDerek Andersen: Hey, Justin. It's Derek. I'll take the other part of your question there. First, I'd say we're really pleased with the momentum we're seeing in the business overall. The year-over-year growth rate accelerated sequentially. It's the third quarter in a row that we've grown the top line more than 50% year-over-year. And obviously, the guide going into Q2 is to accelerate that further. You're right. The comps in the Q2, for sure, are a little bit easier. But if you get into the second half, those comps are going to look a little bit more like what we saw in Q1. So obviously, they're a little tougher. We feel good about the results we put up in Q1 on relatively tougher comps. Right now, what we're really focused on is making the investments in our sales and sales support to build on the momentum. We like what we're seeing on the active advertiser growth. We're liking what we see on the upfront commitments and we're focused on delivering the return on ad spend, investing in our optimization capabilities so that we can deliver return on ad spend for those advertising partners just to continue to build on the momentum we're seeing. Look, while we're excited about the momentum that we're seeing there on the Spotlight side, it's early there. We're really excited about the product and the momentum. In terms of the need to open that up to advertising, I think we continue to be more demand constrained than supply constrained. So, we're going to continue to focus on improving the experience for our Snapchatter community and for creators in the near term, and we've got lots of room to grow the top line in the areas that we're already monetizing today over the near term. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I guess the first one, I want to go back to the recent Analyst Day where you talked about potential low 50s revenue growth for the next few years without any contribution from Spotlight or Maps. Maybe just talk to us a little more about what are you seeing or assuming from an advertiser growth, multi-quarter advertiser spend adoption cycle or even sort of the use cases that give you confidence to be able to grow faster the next three years than the last three? And then the second one. You mentioned the upfront commitments up 50% year-on-year. I think that's after doubling last year. Maybe talk to us about what types of advertiser verticals you're seeing join the platform and grow their spend now that you weren't seeing a year ago? Thanks.\nDerek Andersen: Sure. Hey, Brain. It's Derek speaking. I'll take the first half and then kick it to Jeremi to talk a little bit about what we're seeing with advertisers. Yeah, I think one of the things that we do see is we're excited about the potential to grow the business at elevated rates for an extended period of time. And we see a lot of opportunity just looking at the screens that we're monetizing today in particular. So if I think about the various screens in the app, first, I would zero in on the content business.  We're really pleased with what we've been able to do in terms of growing the commercials product over time. And obviously, we are starting to see some improvement in eCPMs and a lot of that driven around us getting much better at optimization and helping get the right ad in front of the right Snapchatter at the right moment, which allows us to use our inventory more efficiently, deliver the actions that advertisers are looking for with fewer impressions. And that continues to, therefore, expand our ARPU opportunity and the screens that we are optimizing. So that's the most mature part of the business, but still very early. If I move over to camera, we're really excited about some of the momentum that we're seeing around our AR products and our ability to deliver unique advertising experiences there. And obviously, with over 280 million DAU, opening the app 30 times a day, the inventory potential of the map is already immense. So, we're excited about the momentum that we're seeing with our advertising partners and with the inventory potential of those screens. We continue to execute well. And I think if you look at what's happened with the business, as you said, maybe three years ago versus where we are today, we've got a much more sophisticated advertising platform. We've reached feature parity with the largest advertising platform from a sophistication of targeting abilities in terms of the goal-based bidding optimizations and the ad products that are available in terms of driving towards ROI. And so you can see now the build of the momentum, three quarters in a row of growth over 50%, elevated growth even all the way back to Q1 of last year. So, we continue to build on that and deliver returns for our advertisers, and you can see that coming through now in some of the outputs and leading indicators around active advertisers and of course, upfront commitments. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of a sense. And of course, as you look longer term, the opportunity to grow the business by starting to tap into other areas of the app that are more greenfield at this point in time, whether that be the math where we're focused on building utility for advertisers in the near term or eventually over time to realize the opportunity to expand our ARPU with Spotlight and other product innovation. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of a sense of where we are and where we're seeing the momentum in the near term.\nJeremi Gorman: And then I can take the part about upfront. So in specific around the upfront commitments that are up over 50% year-over-year, even after doubling in 2020, so we're very excited about that. Obviously, I think one of the most compelling reasons to do upfront is to really understand what part of a media plan you make up for a large advertiser. And these are incredible signals to say that we have definitely moved out of the experimental budget and into the fabric of their always-on media plans. And that comes from a lot of the hard work that's been done over the last several years and ensuring that we're focusing on ROI and optimization and measurement. We know that retaining advertisers really comes down to ROI. So, retaining them and then growing them at this rate are all really good signals for us. In terms of verticals, specifically, we've had a lot of success in e-commerce, CPG, tech, streaming, online education, telco, a lot of these verticals over the last 18 months, 12 months or thereabout. And we're really excited to see the return of some of the categories in which we are historically strong. Theatrical movies would be a really good example of that. They are incredible advertisers when it comes to AR. It's a perfect use case for that. So, we're really excited about that. And then in addition, we've been spending a lot of this time working on the ad tech stack, working with large partners to be very ready for categories in which we aren't historically strong. Travel and leisure being a really good example. Something that will come back, we believe, with a fury and then we have been really preparing for that on the ad tech side as well as on the sales side. So, we're really excited about that. And then, of course, we continue to be very bullish on the e-commerce opportunity. Derek just mentioned that our ad tech is at parity with the largest players, table stake with goal-based bidding, with pixel-based conversion, et cetera, and we're going to continue to invest there. And then when I think of e-commerce and the kinds of things where we can double down, there is no doubt that we think of augmented reality as a huge opportunity in e-commerce and we are excited to bring more of that innovation to our partners at SPS.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRoss Sandler: Hey, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. I just want to ask one on what Jeremi just talked about the shopping experience. So, you've got a lot of e-commerce advertisers buying ads. Some of those are click out and some of those are these new AR lenses and these new kind of in-app experiences. So the question is, what do you see is the future of Snaps' in-app shopping experience? Can you help us size how big this category or this opportunity could be? And then you recently acquired Fit Analytics and Ariel AI. How do those two acquisitions fit into the strategy? Thanks a lot.\nEvan Spiegel: Thanks, Ross, for the question. Certainly, a lot of stuff that's super exciting in commerce, especially with the big acceleration we saw through COVID. So, I think I can talk about a couple of things that we're working on. Maybe I can start with augmented reality because it's such an interesting opportunity to really differentiate the shopping experience and make it more engaging for consumers. But what we're seeing that's really compelling for retailers is that AR try-on can dramatically improve conversion. And as you mentioned, we acquired Fit Analytics to try to take that a step further to help people find the right styles and fit for what they're purchasing, which we believe can also help reduce returns overall, which should improve margins for retailers. So, we believe that AR can really help retailers on the top and bottom line and also provide a really compelling shopping experience for consumers as well. We're experimenting in many other areas, though. I can highlight Minis as an example or native checkout where we're really trying to remove friction from the checkout process overall, so that brands who want to host their own store on Snap can make it really easy for folks who want to buy their products to essentially tap and buy in one click with safe credit card data and things like that. So, our investments are really across the board. We're trying to remove friction from the shopping experience and reflect the fact that consumer behavior has shifted. I think there will certainly be folks who go to a destination to shop, but more and more what we're seeing is that content and things like augmented reality experiences can drive new types of behavior and then shopping actually happens downstream of that. So people are discovering products and interacting with them in new ways through content and through augmented reality, and then we're going to work really hard to make the conversion as seamless as possible.\nJeremi Gorman: I can talk a little bit about that from the advertiser perspective, from augmented reality and the Lenses is that really during the lockdowns, during the pandemic, advertisers accelerated their adoption of AR products out of necessity. They had to. They had to ensure that they could get the products into the proverbial hands of their customers when things like malls and showrooms were closed, and that really accelerated a trend that we think is really important. And the best part about it is that our Snapchat community was already there. They're already using augmented reality quite a bit every day. We have over 5 billion videos and pictures taken in the camera every day. And so the shoppers are already there and the advertisers are meeting them where they were. It's very rare to be in a position where marketing opportunity is such wide open spaces. So, we're really excited to see the acceleration of that. And I think most importantly, what we're seeing, as Evan talked about, is that AR is driving real business results. So, this isn't just a stunt. This isn't just a brand campaign. Our goal-based bidding products work with augmented reality and the performance is there. We've seen it with Dior. We saw it with Zenni. We saw it with a number of others. And we've learned, of course, that when we deliver this ROI, we will continue to grow. And so we are very optimistic about this space.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thanks. One, I guess, for Jeremi and one for Evan. Jeremi, what are you seeing in terms of just advertiser adoption and budget scaling, specifically since pushing the AR Lens ads into the self-service platform and allowing advertisers to buy those across more objectives? And then, Evan, maybe you can talk about the expansion of the Snap Camera functionalities to Samsung devices. What is the ultimate kind of business implication for that? Is that driving activity back to the core app? Is that sponsored lenses and filters getting distribution more broadly, kind of help us understand that kind of strategically and how it impacts the business? Thanks.\nJeremi Gorman: Sure. Thank you so much for the question. As far as AR Lens is scaling, it's still early, but we're expanding the range of use cases that AR can solve for businesses. We've talked a little bit about the e-commerce opportunity, the retail opportunity. There's a big beauty opportunity. We've had a lot of advertisers with makeup try-on, with nail polish try-on, et cetera. But we're continuing to expand that range of use cases and ensure that it is performance along the way. So, this includes the addition of new goal-based bidding options for augmented reality products. But really as the shopping - online shopping continues to accelerate, we just believe there is a massive untapped opportunity for AR-driven product innovation in e-commerce, but we're seeing it with automotive as well, really just getting across the board. Travel is a really exciting one when we start to think about how we can have our Snapchat community experience places or what does the new travel experience look like on a plane and a hotel, et cetera. All of those things can be experimented within augmented reality and experienced, which is great. But really, what we are focused on is tailoring our solutions for apparel and accessories since it's the largest shopping category by far amongst US teenagers.\nEvan Spiegel: Thanks, Lloyd, for the question about Camera Kit. It's certainly something we're really excited about. And even beyond Samsung, we're now expanding Camera Kit into many partner applications, including, as I mentioned, Moj in India, which is integrated into their application. I think what's really exciting for us that because augmented reality is so new, there are still so many people in the world who haven't actually experienced it or played with it. And so more than we can expand augmented reality into different cameras and other services that people use, the more they can try it, find out how fun it is, realize the power of augmented reality and then, ultimately, hopefully come to Snapchat for a much bigger selection of our Lenses and to really engage with our entire lens creator community. So, we're really excited to get that out there. And hopefully, we've got some more interesting partnerships along the way. We've got our Snap Partner Summit on May 20, that we're really looking forward to. And hopefully, you can join us there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nBrent Thill: Yeah. Thanks for - Jeremi and Derek, you mentioned the user behavior really started picking up as things started to open up again. I'm curious, did you see a subsequent advertiser behavior pickup and anything to point out in terms of linearity throughout the quarter or the start of Q2?\nDerek Andersen: Hey. It's Derek speaking. Yeah, I think, one, really pleased with the momentum. And Jeremi mentioned in our prepared remarks a little earlier just about how we're seeing some positive momentum with some categories as we see reopening and how we're excited to serve some of the categories that maybe had a little tougher go through some of the restrictions that you'd expect to return. And so, obviously, we've made a lot of progress with our platforms over the last year, too. So optimistic about the reopening and the momentum that we're seeing in the business. And I spoke a little bit earlier about the trajectory in terms of comps and obviously, our guide reflects the facts that comps get a little bit easier as we go into Q2, and that's why we've guided to a pretty significant acceleration there. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of a sense of how we're feeling about the reopening and the momentum we've got with our partners and then also sort of the topography of things as we move into Q2.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Morris with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nMichael Morris: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. A couple of questions. First, you referenced the successful implementation of the SKAdNetwork for certain Snap campaigns with your partners. I'm curious what defined success of that implementation? And does this mean similar feedback to what you saw previously? Do you expect this to mitigate some of the IDFA headwinds that have been a source of investor concern? And then second, I just want to ask you a little maybe more tactically about the AR opportunity. You've spoken about a lot. And I'm curious if you - how you see the adoption curve by your advertiser partners. Are there certain sort of milestones that you think you can accomplish this year on the sort of education or implementation front for your partners that can accelerate that curve? Do you think it's sort of a steady growth trajectory? Just curious how you see that playing out. Thank you.\nJeremi Gorman: Sure. Thank you so much for the question. I can take the part about SKAdNetwork. We are really focused on helping our advertisers make the transition to the best possible measurement and optimization tools smoothly. The change happened later than we expected, which gave us a lot of time to prepare and SKAdNetwork is one part of that. So, we're really pleased to see that advertisers that represent the majority of our direct response revenue have implemented it so far. But we know that there's a lot of work to be done to transition smoothly. We're working closely with Apple to understand the rules of the road and we're prepared to follow them. And I think importantly, we really support Apple's approach because we've always believed that great advertising and customer privacy are not mutually exclusive. And it's a huge core value of Snap privacy. And so we're excited to be implementing this alongside our partners that's been a huge cross-functional effort between products, engineering, the sales teams, the marketing teams to work with our customers to ensure that this transition goes as smoothly as possible.\nEvan Spiegel: I guess I can speak a little bit to the AR opportunity. I think what's really interesting is despite the fact that 200 million people are using augmented reality every single day, it's still very, very early for augmented reality advertising and for businesses as a whole to understand how it can really drive results for them. So, I think one of the most important things is to continue to really inspire businesses with the creative execution and the AR interaction. And one of the ways that we're doing that is helping to connect them with creators. There are now thousands and thousands of people around the world making incredible AR experiences, and they can work very closely with brands to bring their ideas to life. And then, I think the other important thing that we've spent a lot of time on is making sure that when brands do experiment with AR, that they have a positive experience that measurement is really easy, and they can see the results very quickly for their campaigns. And of course, then showcase those augmented reality experiences on their brand profile. So I'd say overall, it's really early, but the results for advertisers that are experimenting with AR are extremely promising, and the engagement we see from our community is truly staggering. So, I think that bodes well for the long term. But given it's such a new technology despite the tremendous level of engagement, it's just going to take time to really work to educate advertisers and remove friction from the creation process.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Doug Anmuth with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nDoug Anmuth: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Derek, just wanted to ask you about infra costs. They were down on a per DAU basis, about 13% year-over-year. I know you talked about the biggest part of that, perhaps coming from the messaging efficiency improvements. But as you look out over a multi-year period, do you still see room for meaningful further improvement in infra cost per DAU? And where do you think those could come from? Or do we run into a kind of flattening out more there? Thanks.\nDerek Andersen: Hey, Doug. Thanks for the question. Yeah, we're really pleased with what we saw in infrastructure costs here. We've been able to keep them relatively flat on a per DAU basis for a few years now. And now a pretty good step down in Q1 with the drop to $0.62 per DAU from $0.69. So a really nice improvement there. As you noted, we're making a lot of progress on efficiency here. And I would say that there's no one single improvement that tends to move the needle in a big way. This is a long game of really good work by the engineering and product teams to continue to find efficiency. And one of the really important flywheels that we're experiencing there is that when we make the product work better and faster and more efficiently for our Snapchatter community, that tends to also make it more efficient for us on an infrastructure utilization perspective. And of course, that helps to drive engagement and lower our costs. And when we have engagement grow, that gives us more volume. And of course, that gives us more scale with our partners, which gives us more ability to negotiate and drive down our rates. And so what you're really seeing is that flywheel demonstrated in Q1 really well, where we've had a number of efficiency improvements that were engineered by our teams, compounded by some negotiated rate improvements, all delivering together to give us a really nice result. Over the long term, there's going to be a battle here. We've got really a healthy engagement with our community. And so that puts upward pressure on the infrastructure cost per DAU in a good way, but of course, contributes to the ARPU opportunity at the same time. But our teams continue to grind at our unit metrics and our rates with our partners. And so to the extent that you see infra go up in any period, that's a great sign for engagement. And to the extent that you see it go down is because we're doing a good job managing our unit costs and our partners. So hopefully, that helps explain what we're seeing there and really pleased with the results from our team. So thanks for noticing.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session, as well as Snap Inc.'s first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Thank you for attending today's session.

            "name": "Derek Andersen",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeremi. Our Q1 financial results reflect our priorities of growing our community, making focused investments in the future of our business, and scaling our operations efficiently in order to drive towards profitability and positive free cash flow. As Evan mentioned earlier, our community grew to 280 million daily active users in Q1, an increase of 51 million or 22% year-over-year. The growth in our community continues to be broad based, with year-over-year and sequential growth on both iOS and Android platforms. In North America, DAU grew by 5 million or 5% year-over-year to reach 93 million. In Europe, DAU grew by 7 million or 9% year-over-year to reach 77 million. In Rest of World, DAU grew by 40 million or 57% year-over-year to reach 111 million. We believe Snapchat is a complement to real friendships, and the easing of COVID-19 related restrictions in many communities was a modest tailwind to engagement, as we moved through Q1 that contributed in part to the growth in our Snapchatter community. The continued robust growth in Rest of World reflects the benefit of our ongoing investments to better serve our community, including investments in local content, local language support, marketing partnerships, and the popularity of augmented reality Lenses created by our community. Total revenue for Q1 was $770 million, an increase of 66% year-over-year, representing a 4 percentage point acceleration over the prior quarter. We benefited from continued improvement in the operating environment in Q1 and strong momentum with our advertising products and partners. In addition, the iOS platform policy changes that we expected could cause interruptions to demand in Q1 did not occur in the quarter, and thus were not a headwind in the period. In North America, revenue grew 75% year-over-year in Q1, while ARPU grew 66% year-over-year, as we continue to benefit from the significant investments we made in our sales teams and sales support in the prior year. In Europe, revenue grew 49% year-over-year in Q1, while ARPU grew 36% year-over-year. In Rest of World, revenue grew 46% year-over-year in Q1, representing a 19 percentage point acceleration in growth over the prior quarter, as we began to see the operating environment recover in this region, which was relatively more impacted by COVID-19 related disruptions to demand in the second half of 2020. As indicated during our recent Investor Day, we are accelerating our investments in sales and sales support beyond North America in 2021 in order to capture our global ARPU opportunity faster in the years ahead. Average eCPM increased 67% year-over-year in Q1. Rising eCPM relative to the prior year is driven by a combination of improved optimization capabilities within our auction, a mix shift toward relatively higher eCPM products such as commercials, as well as a mix shift toward relatively higher eCPM regions such as North America. While our topline has benefited from year-over-year growth in eCPM in recent quarters, the cost per action for our advertising partners declined sequentially for three of our top four goal-based bidding objectives in Q1, as we continue to enhance our optimization capabilities in order to use our inventory more efficiently. Consequently, we believe that we will be able to deliver attractive returns on ad spend to our advertising partners as eCPM grows over the long term. In addition, the ongoing growth of our community and strong engagement in areas of our application that we have not yet begun to monetize, provide significant room to expand our inventory and expand our long-term ARPU opportunity over time. Gross margins were 47% in Q1, an increase of approximately 1 percentage point year-over-year. We continue to make significant progress against our goal of driving down our underlying infrastructure unit costs over time. In Q1, our infrastructure costs per DAU benefited from several factors, with the most significant being efficiency improvements delivered by our engineering teams, including the re-architecture of our messaging platform that we mentioned during our recent Investor Day. In addition, we continued to benefit in Q1 from negotiated rate improvements for several of our cloud services. Lastly, the acceleration in growth of our community has been a modest benefit to infrastructure cost per DAU in recent quarters as new users tend to have lower initial marginal cloud infrastructure costs relative to longer tenured Snapchatters. These factors combined to deliver the lowest infrastructure costs per DAU we have reported as a public company at just $0.62 in Q1, down from $0.69 in the prior quarter and $0.71 in the prior year. On the content side, we continue to invest to support the launch of Spotlight in Q1. And this contributed approximately $90 million to our cost of revenue in the quarter, representing a 12 percentage point headwind to gross margin expansion in the quarter. We are highly encouraged by the early returns from our investments in Spotlight, with this new platform reaching over 125 million monthly active users in March. While it is still very early for this new platform, we are excited about the potential for Spotlight to further expand our monetization opportunity in the future. In addition, we are pleased that we have been able to support the launch of Spotlight while continuing to expand our gross margins year-over-year, which reflects our overall approach of scaling our operations efficiently, while making investments in the future of our business. Operating expenses were $367 million in Q1, up 23% year-over-year. Average full-time headcount grew 19% year-over-year in Q1, as we continue to make focused investments in our monetization and engineering teams. The rate of growth in headcount in Q1 was several percentage points below our operating plan expectations, and we expect this will step up modestly in future quarters as we invest to accelerate our roadmap as discussed at our recent Investor Day. In addition, we continue to grow our investments in marketing in order to build on the momentum we have established with our advertising and Snapchatter communities, and we are pleased with the results we are seeing from these efforts thus far as evidenced by the growth in our active advertiser base and Snapchatter community. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $2 million in Q1, an improvement of $80 million year-over-year as we continue to grow our top line rapidly while scaling our cost structure efficiently. We delivered adjusted EBITDA leverage of 26% in Q1, as we continue to invest in the future of our business while making progress towards sustained profitability and positive free cash flow. Net income was negative $287 million in Q1, an improvement of $19 million over the prior year. The year-over-year improvement in net income primarily reflects the flow-through of the $80 million improvement in adjusted EBITDA and $34 million higher net investment gains versus the prior year due to a combination of realized and unrealized gains on various strategic investments. These favorable impacts were partially offset by $94 million higher stock-based compensation driven by several factors, including approximately $43 million attributable to the 19% growth in headcount and retention of our existing team, approximately $29 million related to payroll taxes on SBC driven by our higher stock price, as well as approximately $19 million driven by higher SBC related to long-term retention associated with several acquisitions completed in the last year. While we have continued to grow our team, and leverage stock-based compensation strategically to foster an ownership culture and drive long-term retention, we have remained focused on managing these programs responsibly. Total fully diluted shares outstanding grew 2.6% year-over-year in Q1, down from 3.4% in the prior quarter and below the 3% estimate we shared during our recent Investor Day. Q1 marked our first-ever quarter of positive free cash flow as a public company at $126 million, an improvement of $131 million year-over-year. The improvement was driven primarily by the $80 million improvement in adjusted EBITDA and an approximately $75 million improvement in net working capital, as we continue to focus on enhancing our cash conversion cycle. This was partially offset by the approximately $29 million increase in SBC-related payroll taxes noted earlier. We ended the quarter with $2.6 billion in cash and marketable securities, up from $2.1 billion in the prior year, as the proceeds of convertible notes issued in Q2 2020 more than offset the investments we have made to grow the business over the past year. As we look forward to Q2, we estimate that DAU will grow at a rate consistent with the prior quarter, or approximately 22% year-over-year to reach $290 million in Q2. On the monetization side, we are cautiously optimistic that the operating environment will continue to improve. Our guidance range is for revenue of $820 million to $840 million, implying year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 80% to 85% in Q2. This range reflects our best current estimate of the potential impact of anticipated disruptions associated with the iOS platform changes. It is not clear yet what the longer-term impact of the iOS platform changes may be for the top line momentum of our business. And this may not be clear until several months or more after the changes are implemented. Until then, we will remain focused on helping our partners navigate these changes while optimizing return on ad spend across our advertising products and platform. On the expense side in Q2, we intend to continue to invest in the long-term growth of our business, and we'll continue to support the launch of Spotlight with our $1 million per day creator fund in order to build on the momentum we are seeing with this exciting new platform. While we see a path to adjusted EBITDA breakeven in Q2, we are also cognizant that there are a number of cost drivers for our business, including travel and event-related costs that have been lower over the past year due to COVID-related restrictions. It is likely that these activities will begin to resume in the coming months as restrictions ease and that the related costs will begin to return to our cost structure as a result. Given this, our guidance range is for adjusted EBITDA to be between negative $20 million and breakeven for Q2. Thank you for joining our call today. And we will now take your questions. Hey, Justin. It's Derek. I'll take the other part of your question there. First, I'd say we're really pleased with the momentum we're seeing in the business overall. The year-over-year growth rate accelerated sequentially. It's the third quarter in a row that we've grown the top line more than 50% year-over-year. And obviously, the guide going into Q2 is to accelerate that further. You're right. The comps in the Q2, for sure, are a little bit easier. But if you get into the second half, those comps are going to look a little bit more like what we saw in Q1. So obviously, they're a little tougher. We feel good about the results we put up in Q1 on relatively tougher comps. Right now, what we're really focused on is making the investments in our sales and sales support to build on the momentum. We like what we're seeing on the active advertiser growth. We're liking what we see on the upfront commitments and we're focused on delivering the return on ad spend, investing in our optimization capabilities so that we can deliver return on ad spend for those advertising partners just to continue to build on the momentum we're seeing. Look, while we're excited about the momentum that we're seeing there on the Spotlight side, it's early there. We're really excited about the product and the momentum. In terms of the need to open that up to advertising, I think we continue to be more demand constrained than supply constrained. So, we're going to continue to focus on improving the experience for our Snapchatter community and for creators in the near term, and we've got lots of room to grow the top line in the areas that we're already monetizing today over the near term. Thanks for the question. Sure. Hey, Brain. It's Derek speaking. I'll take the first half and then kick it to Jeremi to talk a little bit about what we're seeing with advertisers. Yeah, I think one of the things that we do see is we're excited about the potential to grow the business at elevated rates for an extended period of time. And we see a lot of opportunity just looking at the screens that we're monetizing today in particular. So if I think about the various screens in the app, first, I would zero in on the content business.  We're really pleased with what we've been able to do in terms of growing the commercials product over time. And obviously, we are starting to see some improvement in eCPMs and a lot of that driven around us getting much better at optimization and helping get the right ad in front of the right Snapchatter at the right moment, which allows us to use our inventory more efficiently, deliver the actions that advertisers are looking for with fewer impressions. And that continues to, therefore, expand our ARPU opportunity and the screens that we are optimizing. So that's the most mature part of the business, but still very early. If I move over to camera, we're really excited about some of the momentum that we're seeing around our AR products and our ability to deliver unique advertising experiences there. And obviously, with over 280 million DAU, opening the app 30 times a day, the inventory potential of the map is already immense. So, we're excited about the momentum that we're seeing with our advertising partners and with the inventory potential of those screens. We continue to execute well. And I think if you look at what's happened with the business, as you said, maybe three years ago versus where we are today, we've got a much more sophisticated advertising platform. We've reached feature parity with the largest advertising platform from a sophistication of targeting abilities in terms of the goal-based bidding optimizations and the ad products that are available in terms of driving towards ROI. And so you can see now the build of the momentum, three quarters in a row of growth over 50%, elevated growth even all the way back to Q1 of last year. So, we continue to build on that and deliver returns for our advertisers, and you can see that coming through now in some of the outputs and leading indicators around active advertisers and of course, upfront commitments. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of a sense. And of course, as you look longer term, the opportunity to grow the business by starting to tap into other areas of the app that are more greenfield at this point in time, whether that be the math where we're focused on building utility for advertisers in the near term or eventually over time to realize the opportunity to expand our ARPU with Spotlight and other product innovation. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of a sense of where we are and where we're seeing the momentum in the near term. Hey. It's Derek speaking. Yeah, I think, one, really pleased with the momentum. And Jeremi mentioned in our prepared remarks a little earlier just about how we're seeing some positive momentum with some categories as we see reopening and how we're excited to serve some of the categories that maybe had a little tougher go through some of the restrictions that you'd expect to return. And so, obviously, we've made a lot of progress with our platforms over the last year, too. So optimistic about the reopening and the momentum that we're seeing in the business. And I spoke a little bit earlier about the trajectory in terms of comps and obviously, our guide reflects the facts that comps get a little bit easier as we go into Q2, and that's why we've guided to a pretty significant acceleration there. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of a sense of how we're feeling about the reopening and the momentum we've got with our partners and then also sort of the topography of things as we move into Q2. Hey, Doug. Thanks for the question. Yeah, we're really pleased with what we saw in infrastructure costs here. We've been able to keep them relatively flat on a per DAU basis for a few years now. And now a pretty good step down in Q1 with the drop to $0.62 per DAU from $0.69. So a really nice improvement there. As you noted, we're making a lot of progress on efficiency here.

            "content": "Thanks, Evan. We were pleased with our results this quarter and we continue to make progress against the many opportunities we have to support our community and our advertising partners globally. In Q1, we generated total revenue of $770 million, growing 66% year-over-year. More advertisers were active on our platform than ever as our active advertiser base approximately doubled year-over-year in Q1. We have a large opportunity to gain share of the global digital ad market, which is $340 billion and growing. To capture this opportunity, we remain focused on our three key priorities. First, investing in our ad platform in order to drive improved relevance and deliver measurable ROI. Second, efficiently scaling our sales and marketing functions to support our advertising partners globally. And third, building innovative ad experiences through video and augmented reality that deliver real business value. Our three priorities, along with our unique reach and growing global audience allow us to drive performance at scale. We believe firmly in performance-driven advertising, and continue to scale our measurement tools and goal-based bidding capabilities that allow advertisers to optimize for the objectives they are trying to achieve. We continue to see over half our revenue come from direct response campaigns. Revenue from our Pixel Purchase GBB was up over three times year-over-year. Revenue from our subscription GBB was also up over three times year-over-year, and revenue from our Pixel Signup GBB nearly doubled year-over-year. We are seeing more and more advertisers leverage our tools to drive measurable returns, and as a result increase spend incrementally. For example, we saw TechStyle leverage Pixel Purchase optimization to drive purchases for its portfolio of direct-to-consumer brands, resulting in an efficient cost per purchase up to 25% below goal in Q1. After seeing these results, they plan to invest more with Snap throughout 2021. This gives us confidence in our ability to grow budgets and increase our share of wallet over time. In addition, as advertiser demand and diversity grow, we can serve more relevant ads to each Snapchatter, leading to improved ROI for our partners. We believe this will help us to quickly and easily onboard many more advertisers while also driving ROI for them as we scale. This has also been accelerated by the improvements we continue to make to our ad products and backend optimization, which have increased the scale at which we're able to deliver results for advertisers. For example, our Dynamic Ads format enables retailers to run e-commerce campaigns on Snapchat that automatically optimizes across their entire catalog. Adidas Canada leveraged our Dynamic Ads as a part of their Always On e-commerce strategy, which resulted in a 4.4 times incremental return on ad spend. We are also committed to working with our advertisers as we navigate the App Tracking Transparency-related changes from Apple. We are supportive of Apple's approach because we have always believed that advertising should respect customers' privacy. The fact that these changes are coming later than we anticipated has provided additional time to adopt Apple's SKAdNetwork and begin implementing and testing with our partners. Advertisers that represent a majority of our direct response advertising revenue have successfully implemented SKAdnetwork for their Snap campaigns. Beyond that, we are currently designing an array of privacy-centric solutions, both short and long-term, to ensure we deliver a privacy-first experience for our community and best-in-class offerings for our partners. Our sales team is finding success across a broad set of verticals. Top-performing verticals in Q1 included e-commerce, retail, entertainment, restaurants, tech, telco, apparel, streaming, gaming, and CPG. For example, Yoplait participated in our CPG Fast Track program to prove short-term sales lift for advertisers who hadn't previously invested with Snapchat. Their campaign leveraged Snap Ads and Lenses, which resulted in new buyers driving nearly 30% of incremental sales, and exposure to their Sponsored Lens driving over 40% of incremental sales. We are also delighted to see some traditionally strong categories return, such as theatrical films, and we're beginning to tackle some large categories in which we're well positioned but haven't previously had a large presence, such as travel and leisure. From a regional perspective, North America represents our largest revenue base, and it's also our fastest growing. We doubled down on our investments in sales and sales support in North America over the past 18 months and we've observed higher growth in this region in recent quarters. We see a lot of opportunity to repeat this effort outside of North America in order to accelerate our growth internationally. As we shared in our recent investor day, we also have a lot of room to grow in some of the world's most established advertising markets outside of North America. For example, in the countries that comprise over half the world's digital ad spend, Snapchat reaches 70% of 13 to 34 year-olds, so we already have deep penetration of critical demographics that our advertising partners are eager to reach in the most important digital ad markets beyond North America. We will be making the investments to capture this opportunity in the coming quarters in order to grow our sales teams and enhance sales support in international markets, and we are excited about the opportunity to accelerate our top line growth in these markets in the years ahead. We continue to invest heavily to grow our video advertising business, which currently represents our largest revenue driver. As mobile content consumption continues to rise, we've seen growing demand for our video ad products such as commercials. A study with IPG Media Lab showed that on Snapchat, the short form six-second ads persuaded more customers to consider purchasing the products featured in the commercials compared to 15-second ads. Another study, produced jointly with Omnicom Media Group, showed that Gen Z and Millennials significantly increased their video consumption in 2020, and say that they spend over one hour per day watching video on social media apps alone. Lastly, our work with brands over the past year has resulted in upfront commitments for our commercials ad format from our brand advertising partners more than tripling year-over-year for 2021. We'll be doubling down on our outreach to video advertisers in just a few weeks when we present at the Annual NewFronts Conference to further capture the opportunity we see in video advertising. During the pandemic, advertisers accelerated their adoption of our AR products to enable product sampling and try-ons, when they were forced to find alternatives to traditional methods. This has accelerated the adoption of these use cases and helped pull forward adoption of AR-driven e-commerce. We are excited about the new ways that our advertising partners will leverage AR as the world re-opens. As Evan mentioned, AR can deliver truly immersive experiences when overlaid on the world around you, and we are eager to continue to innovate as more people get out of the house and begin to explore more places. One of the primary reasons for the acceleration in adoption is because brands have learned how to utilize augmented reality to drive real business results. One of our goals is to combine AR experiences like fit and try-on with personalization and customers' preferences to vastly improve the shopping experience, while driving purchases and reducing returns. We believe we are going after a large opportunity. 94% of people are expecting to use AR for shopping the same or more in 2022 versus 2021, according to a study we commissioned with Deloitte. For example, Dior launched a Lens campaign that enabled Snapchatters to try on six pairs of B27 sneakers through augmented reality. The Lenses were promoted directly in the Lens Carousel within the Snapchat camera and via Snap Ads, with videos showing runway models and users playing with the Lens and encouraging Snapchatters to try on the sneakers, which they could do just by swiping up. The AR Lens that was promoted in our Lens Carousel was well received by Snapchatters and resulted in a 6.2 times return on ad spend. Dior also leveraged their business profile, effectively turning its home on Snapchat into a digital showroom, complete with virtual try-ons at the product's launch. In addition, Zenni Optical sought to engage Snapchatters this Valentine's Day with a Shoppable Lens experience that enabled them to try on and purchase from their large online selection of affordable glasses. The Lens resulted in a significant lift in purchases and drove a 7.9 times return on ad spend. We have a great opportunity to help brands reach their customers in unique and innovative ways while continuing to deliver measurable ROI. Businesses leveraging AR as one component of a larger, multi-product campaign on Snapchat tend to achieve stronger results. For example, The CW's Superman & Lois campaign utilized Snap Ads, commercials, and Lens to generate double-digit lifts in ad awareness and a nine point lift in show awareness. When Snapchatters were exposed to multiple products, show awareness for the campaign increased by 2.7 times. We have a lot more work to do in helping businesses understand the value of our many offerings on Snapchat, but we are thrilled with the early successes that our partners are seeing and we are going to continue to invest in this opportunity. This quarter was a strong start to 2021, as we saw the momentum we built in the back half of last year continue. The amount of money committed via upfronts for 2021 is already more than 50% above the total upfront commitments made in 2020, which is a strong signal that brands and agencies have confidence in our platform, and are committed to working with us in an always-on manner because they value the return on ad spend that they are receiving. Based on the size of our audience, their level of engagement across our service, and our overall opportunity in the growing digital ad market, we are well positioned to play an important role in driving results for our advertising partners across the world. In summary, I couldn't be more excited about the opportunities for our business in 2021 and beyond, and I look forward to sharing progress with you throughout the year. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Derek. Hey, Rich. Thanks for the question. You are definitely right that our North America business has been both our largest and our fastest-growing revenue base. I think one of the most exciting things about that is that we have doubled down on the investments in sales and sales support in North America over the past 18 months since verticalization actually, and we've observed higher growth in this region as a result in these recent quarters. We did verticalize our international sales teams. But generally speaking, the sales and sales support teams in our international regions are smaller. So it was more difficult to kind of perfectly execute this verticalization and specialist in terms of different vertical, measurement specialists or marketing specialists or communication specialists by vertical. But I think what's so exciting about the opportunity is that we now know the playbook. You're seeing it show up in our strong results in North America. And so we are going to replicate it in Europe and the rest of the world and those investments we were talking about to accelerate our growth internationally. We talked about this at our recent Investor Day that I know a lot of you are listening to, but we do have so much room to grow in one of the world's - in some of the world's most established advertising markets outside of North America, where we have really strong smartphone penetration. In countries that comprise over half the world's digital ad spend, Snapchat reaches 70% of 13 to 34 year-olds. So, we're already there with deep penetration of critical demographics that our advertising partners are eager to reach. So in 2021, to answer your question, we're going to be making these investments in sales and sales support teams to capture the opportunity, the way that we have in North America in the coming quarters and going to grow those teams to grow top line growth in the years ahead. And then I can take the part about upfront. So in specific around the upfront commitments that are up over 50% year-over-year, even after doubling in 2020, so we're very excited about that. Obviously, I think one of the most compelling reasons to do upfront is to really understand what part of a media plan you make up for a large advertiser. And these are incredible signals to say that we have definitely moved out of the experimental budget and into the fabric of their always-on media plans. And that comes from a lot of the hard work that's been done over the last several years and ensuring that we're focusing on ROI and optimization and measurement. We know that retaining advertisers really comes down to ROI. So, retaining them and then growing them at this rate are all really good signals for us. In terms of verticals, specifically, we've had a lot of success in e-commerce, CPG, tech, streaming, online education, telco, a lot of these verticals over the last 18 months, 12 months or thereabout. And we're really excited to see the return of some of the categories in which we are historically strong. Theatrical movies would be a really good example of that. They are incredible advertisers when it comes to AR. It's a perfect use case for that. So, we're really excited about that. And then in addition, we've been spending a lot of this time working on the ad tech stack, working with large partners to be very ready for categories in which we aren't historically strong. Travel and leisure being a really good example. Something that will come back, we believe, with a fury and then we have been really preparing for that on the ad tech side as well as on the sales side. So, we're really excited about that. And then, of course, we continue to be very bullish on the e-commerce opportunity. Derek just mentioned that our ad tech is at parity with the largest players, table stake with goal-based bidding, with pixel-based conversion, et cetera, and we're going to continue to invest there. And then when I think of e-commerce and the kinds of things where we can double down, there is no doubt that we think of augmented reality as a huge opportunity in e-commerce and we are excited to bring more of that innovation to our partners at SPS. I can talk a little bit about that from the advertiser perspective, from augmented reality and the Lenses is that really during the lockdowns, during the pandemic, advertisers accelerated their adoption of AR products out of necessity. They had to. They had to ensure that they could get the products into the proverbial hands of their customers when things like malls and showrooms were closed, and that really accelerated a trend that we think is really important. And the best part about it is that our Snapchat community was already there. They're already using augmented reality quite a bit every day. We have over 5 billion videos and pictures taken in the camera every day. And so the shoppers are already there and the advertisers are meeting them where they were. It's very rare to be in a position where marketing opportunity is such wide open spaces. So, we're really excited to see the acceleration of that. And I think most importantly, what we're seeing, as Evan talked about, is that AR is driving real business results. So, this isn't just a stunt. This isn't just a brand campaign. Our goal-based bidding products work with augmented reality and the performance is there. We've seen it with Dior. We saw it with Zenni. We saw it with a number of others. And we've learned, of course, that when we deliver this ROI, we will continue to grow. And so we are very optimistic about this space. Sure. Thank you so much for the question. As far as AR Lens is scaling, it's still early, but we're expanding the range of use cases that AR can solve for businesses. We've talked a little bit about the e-commerce opportunity, the retail opportunity. There's a big beauty opportunity. We've had a lot of advertisers with makeup try-on, with nail polish try-on, et cetera. But we're continuing to expand that range of use cases and ensure that it is performance along the way. So, this includes the addition of new goal-based bidding options for augmented reality products. But really as the shopping - online shopping continues to accelerate, we just believe there is a massive untapped opportunity for AR-driven product innovation in e-commerce, but we're seeing it with automotive as well, really just getting across the board. Travel is a really exciting one when we start to think about how we can have our Snapchat community experience places or what does the new travel experience look like on a plane and a hotel, et cetera. All of those things can be experimented within augmented reality and experienced, which is great. But really, what we are focused on is tailoring our solutions for apparel and accessories since it's the largest shopping category by far amongst US teenagers. Sure. Thank you so much for the question. I can take the part about SKAdNetwork. We are really focused on helping our advertisers make the transition to the best possible measurement and optimization tools smoothly. The change happened later than we expected, which gave us a lot of time to prepare and SKAdNetwork is one part of that. So, we're really pleased to see that advertisers that represent the majority of our direct response revenue have implemented it so far. But we know that there's a lot of work to be done to transition smoothly. We're working closely with Apple to understand the rules of the road and we're prepared to follow them. And I think importantly, we really support Apple's approach because we've always believed that great advertising and customer privacy are not mutually exclusive. And it's a huge core value of Snap privacy. And so we're excited to be implementing this alongside our partners that's been a huge cross-functional effort between products, engineering, the sales teams, the marketing teams to work with our customers to ensure that this transition goes as smoothly as possible."

            "name": "Evan Spiegel",
            "content": "Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We began 2021 by achieving our highest year-over-year revenue and daily active user growth rates in over three years during the quarter, and delivering positive free cash flow for the first time as a public company. We grew revenue 66 % year-over-year to $770 million, grew daily active users 22% year-over-year to 280 million, and generated $126 million in free cash flow. The strength of our business underscores our relentless focus on product innovation and our team's ability to execute well together over the long term. This momentum has also enabled us to increase our investments in product innovation and the longer-term future of our business. In addition to expanding our global community and growing our advertising business, we are also focused on improving our augmented reality capabilities and building on the early momentum we are seeing with Spotlight. We are thrilled with the progress we are seeing in these areas, and look forward to accelerating our efforts going forward. We added 15 million daily active users in Q1. A lot of this growth has been unlocked through our ongoing investments in improving the performance and stability of our products across a wide variety of regions and devices. The vast majority of smartphones in the world are powered by Android, and our Android user base is now larger than our iOS user base, a critical milestone that reflects the long-term value of the investment we made to rebuild our Android application. Furthermore, as our user base continues to grow outside the United States, we are evolving our team and operations to be able to more nimbly and effectively support our global community. These efforts range from region-specific performance improvements of our underlying service to the localization of content, creative tools, and language support. We launched our first local-market Snap Original this March with Phone Swap India, and are dramatically expanding our partnerships and sales efforts to support new geographies where we are seeing increasing traction with our community. These efforts have helped drive steady and healthy growth around the world, with our daily active user base outside of North America and Europe now being our largest community. Additionally, we are optimistic about the engagement trends we are seeing as the world is beginning to open up. As things began to open up in the United States in late February, we saw inflection points in key behaviors like story posting and engagement with the Snap Map. More recently, we saw a rise in the rate of new friendships and bi-directional communication on Snapchat in late March, as people have begun to socialize in broader groups. We designed Snapchat to be a useful complement to real-life friendships, and are excited about these optimistic trends developing with our audience. Augmented reality remains one of our biggest opportunities as we look to the future, and we are investing heavily in both core technology and the community-facing AR experiences on our service. The number of Snapchatters engaging daily with our augmented reality Lenses grew more than 40% year-over-year in Q1, outpacing our daily active user growth by more than 80% as people interact more with augmented reality on Snapchat. A lot of this growth has been driven by the incredible creativity of our community. This quarter, Lenses created by our community accounted for more than half of all Lens views. We have also been expanding the capabilities of Lens Studio, where we continue to put powerful technology into the hands of creators to make more compelling experiences, such as Andre Pappas, who leveraged our machine learning platform to create a viral beard removal Lens. We are now bringing our AR platform to cameras beyond Snapchat through Camera Kit. Over the years, we have invested deeply in both our fundamental technology platform and the creativity of our community and partners to make augmented reality a daily activity for over 200 million people around the world. While we are continuing to invest in improving our technology and growing our community on Snapchat, we believe that expanding the number of places where people can interact with these AR experiences is an opportunity to grow the overall augmented reality ecosystem. We are excited to expand our AR capabilities to the Samsung native camera on the latest Galaxy A series, which extends the reach of Lenses to a much larger global audience and complements our existing Bitmoji integration with the Samsung native keyboard. We believe that our leadership in both AR capabilities and user engagement positions us well to expand augmented reality to new use cases and behaviors. For example, as the shift to online shopping continues to accelerate, we believe there is a massive untapped opportunity for AR-driven product innovation in e-commerce, and that our young audience will continue to be early adopters of these new technologies and shopping experiences. One of the key verticals we are tailoring our solutions for is apparel and accessories, which is the largest shopping category by far among US teenagers. We believe that helping buyers find the right size, fit, and styles will reduce friction in their online shopping experience, which in turn will improve revenue and margins for our business partners while reducing the waste generated from returns. This is just one example among a variety of behaviors and use cases we believe we can support through our augmented reality platform. We are also focusing on our ongoing rollout of Spotlight, which is gaining traction as we improve the experience for our community and creators. We launched Spotlight in India, Mexico, and Brazil during Q1, and are now live in over a dozen countries, reaching more than 125 million monthly active users on Spotlight in March. We are also seeing healthy increases in engagement across both creation and consumption on the platform. For example, daily video submissions have increased by over 40% from January to March, while the number of viewers watching Spotlight for at least 10 minutes per day grew by over 70%. We are also continuing to evolve the product itself. We recently launched Public Profiles for our entire community, made improvements to ranking, and are seeing rapid adoption of our Sounds feature as we continue to expand our music library available on Snapchat. Meanwhile, we continue to see healthy growth in viewership of shows on Discover, which has become a go-to destination for credible and entertaining content for our community. We added over 300 new channels in Q1, including Ryan Doesn't Know, a new Snap Original show starring Ryan Reynolds, which reached over 20 million viewers. This has helped us deepen our content offerings in genres that matter to our audience, including news, sports, entertainment, and beauty. For example, we now have over 75 million Snapchatters watching beauty content and over 85 million Snapchatters watching sports content each month on average on Discover. Nearly every aspect of our service, including each of the five screens of Snapchat, is supported by our partners, and we believe that working together we can offer the best and most innovative user experiences for our community. We have been working hard to improve our platform offering for our partners and to help them grow their businesses. For example, we more than doubled the revenue for our gaming partners over the past year, as we continue to work closely toward launching new titles. Meanwhile, we are thrilled to see early progress as we continue to test Business Profiles with partners like L'Oreal and Zenni Optical, using them as an organic digital showroom of their AR Try-On Lenses. We are also expanding the reach of Lens Studio through partners like Moj, one of India's top short video apps to leverage our augmented reality platform by implementing CameraKit in their own application. We have more to announce about these partnerships at our Snap Partner Summit on May 20, which will be broadcast on snappartnersummit.com. We are so excited to celebrate our partners and share more around what we've been working on together. We are excited to see our long-term investments in our advertising business begin to pay off as we deliver higher ROI to advertisers. We still have a lot of upside in terms of the level of optimization and efficiency that we can deliver, and are investing heavily across the board to both improve our ad platform and support our growing global advertiser base. This has developed into a positive flywheel where our improved efficiency has driven more advertisers and larger budgets to our platform, leading to more impressions and learnings, which in turn increases the rate at which we are able to further improve efficiency and ROI. Furthermore, we believe that our philosophy and early investments in building a business that is thoughtful about the privacy and the trust of our community positions us well, as the overall digital advertising industry continues to move in that direction. While there are, of course, a lot of unknowns to figure out along the way, we are excited to work together with our advertising partners to innovate together toward our vision for protecting user privacy while delivering great business results. It has now been over a year since we have been working from home and I am so proud of what our team has accomplished over this period. Furthermore, our financial performance has enabled us to increase our investments in growth and innovation, which positions us well for the future. We are extremely excited and optimistic about our ability to execute against our long-term goals, especially as we look toward working together and serving our community in a post-pandemic world. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeremi to share more about our business. Hey, Rich. Thanks for the question on hardware. I think as we think about the future of augmented reality, really the promise of augmented reality is that you can interact with computing in a way that's similar to how do you interact with the physical world around you. And so I think, ultimately, over a longer period of time, hardware will be a constraint on our ability to fulfill that vision. So today, with your smartphone, you can enjoy augmented reality, but you're limited to this really tiny screen. You have to use the touchscreen. And I think as we think longer term about the future of hardware, there's an opportunity to overlay computing on the world around you in a way that's much more immersive. It allows you to interact with it in terms of using both your hands, having a much - a larger display size in front of you. And I think, as we think about the future of our platform overall, experimenting with hardware informs that software roadmap and helps us think about what we need to be building over the next several years as we work towards this vision, really for a new hardware platform that brings AR to life in a totally different way. Thanks for the question and great to hear about your survey. I guess that lines up definitely with what I've experienced personally during the pandemic. A lot of folks sort of shrunk their social graph. They started talking more to their family members or really close friends. And what we're seeing now in the United States, which is really exciting is that people are going out more and they're seeing more friends or they're returning to school or work. And so their social graph and the people they're interacting with on a regular basis is starting to expand. And that sort of communication with that wider social graph drives a lot of the frequency of use of Snapchat. And then, of course, the conversion then to our other platforms and products that we offer. So, we're super excited that people are out and about and they're taking Snaps with our camera. We mentioned story posting has increased. And we've been investing a ton in the Snap Map. And sadly, over the last year, there hasn't been a lot of reasons to use the Snap Map as everyone's been staying at home. So, we're really excited to see people engaging more with that product and there's a really exciting roadmap there looking forward. So great to see that adoption. Thanks, Ross, for the question. Certainly, a lot of stuff that's super exciting in commerce, especially with the big acceleration we saw through COVID. So, I think I can talk about a couple of things that we're working on. Maybe I can start with augmented reality because it's such an interesting opportunity to really differentiate the shopping experience and make it more engaging for consumers. But what we're seeing that's really compelling for retailers is that AR try-on can dramatically improve conversion. And as you mentioned, we acquired Fit Analytics to try to take that a step further to help people find the right styles and fit for what they're purchasing, which we believe can also help reduce returns overall, which should improve margins for retailers. So, we believe that AR can really help retailers on the top and bottom line and also provide a really compelling shopping experience for consumers as well. We're experimenting in many other areas, though. I can highlight Minis as an example or native checkout where we're really trying to remove friction from the checkout process overall, so that brands who want to host their own store on Snap can make it really easy for folks who want to buy their products to essentially tap and buy in one click with safe credit card data and things like that. So, our investments are really across the board. We're trying to remove friction from the shopping experience and reflect the fact that consumer behavior has shifted. I think there will certainly be folks who go to a destination to shop, but more and more what we're seeing is that content and things like augmented reality experiences can drive new types of behavior and then shopping actually happens downstream of that. So people are discovering products and interacting with them in new ways through content and through augmented reality, and then we're going to work really hard to make the conversion as seamless as possible. Thanks, Lloyd, for the question about Camera Kit. It's certainly something we're really excited about. And even beyond Samsung, we're now expanding Camera Kit into many partner applications, including, as I mentioned, Moj in India, which is integrated into their application. I think what's really exciting for us that because augmented reality is so new, there are still so many people in the world who haven't actually experienced it or played with it. And so more than we can expand augmented reality into different cameras and other services that people use, the more they can try it, find out how fun it is, realize the power of augmented reality and then, ultimately, hopefully come to Snapchat for a much bigger selection of our Lenses and to really engage with our entire lens creator community. So, we're really excited to get that out there. And hopefully, we've got some more interesting partnerships along the way. We've got our Snap Partner Summit on May 20, that we're really looking forward to. And hopefully, you can join us there. I guess I can speak a little bit to the AR opportunity. I think what's really interesting is despite the fact that 200 million people are using augmented reality every single day, it's still very, very early for augmented reality advertising and for businesses as a whole to understand how it can really drive results for them. So, I think one of the most important things is to continue to really inspire businesses with the creative execution and the AR interaction. And one of the ways that we're doing that is helping to connect them with creators. There are now thousands and thousands of people around the world making incredible AR experiences, and they can work very closely with brands to bring their ideas to life. And then, I think the other important thing that we've spent a lot of time on is making sure that when brands do experiment with AR, that they have a positive experience that measurement is really easy, and they can see the results very quickly for their campaigns. And of course, then showcase those augmented reality experiences on their brand profile. So I'd say overall, it's really early, but the results for advertisers that are experimenting with AR are extremely promising, and the engagement we see from our community is truly staggering. So, I think that bodes well for the long term. But given it's such a new technology despite the tremendous level of engagement, it's just going to take time to really work to educate advertisers and remove friction from the creation process."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Evan.\nEvan Spiegel: Hi, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. 2022 was a challenging year for our business as we continue to be impacted by macroeconomic headwinds, platform policy changes and increased competition. We've taken action to refocus our investments to support our three strategic priorities of growing our community and deepening their engagement with our products, accelerating and diversifying our revenue growth and investing in the future of augmented reality. We are focused on the most important inputs that we can control, delivering engaging experiences to Snapchatters and improving business outcomes for our advertising partners. We continue to drive strong growth in our community, ending the year at 375 million daily active users in Q4, an increase of 17% year-over-year. Our team continues to innovate rapidly in ways that support the growth of our community. For example, in Q4, we released communities to expand our content offering on-boarded several new media partners, double down on our progress with spotlight and launch new Snapchat Plus features each of which helps drive engagement across our service. For the full year, we generated $4.6 billion of revenue up 12% year-over-year and generated $1.3 billion in the quarter or flat year-over-year, reflecting the rapid deceleration in digital advertising growth. Direct response advertising is a critical way that many companies grow their businesses, as it is one of the most performant and measurable forms of advertising. We have made progress updating and improving our ad platform over the past year across three key areas, investing in observability and measurement, improving engagement and conversion quality, and increasing the volume of high-quality engagements and conversions. In the very near term, it will take time for these improvements to translate into improved top-line growth. Over the long term, we believe that delivering higher return on advertising spend and utilizing our inventory more efficiently are critical inputs to gaining share of wallet accelerating revenue growth and realizing the full ARPU potential of our business. We believe that the camera represents our greatest opportunity to improve the way people live and communicate. Over the last decade, we have made significant advances to our AR software and hardware that have enabled the growth of the sophisticated AR platform that we have today. Over 250 million Snapchatters engage with augmented reality every day on average, and we are investing rapidly and thoughtfully in the future of AR to further expand our leadership position. We continued our path to sustainable profitability by generating $378 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2022 achieving our third consecutive year of positive adjusted EBITDA. We also generated $55 million of free cash flow in 2022, achieving our second consecutive year of positive free cash flow. 2022 brought significant challenges for our business and we have emerged with a highly engaged and growing community, a more focused team and cost structure a clear path to delivering sustained adjusted EBITDA profitability and positive free cash flow and a strong balance sheet with $3.9 billion in cash and marketable securities. We begin 2023 focused on executing against our three strategic priorities of growing our community and deepening their engagement with our products, accelerating and diversifying our revenue growth and investing in the future of augmented reality. We look forward to sharing more about our progress and plans at our upcoming Investors Day on February 16, at our offices in Santa Monica. Thank you. And with that, we will begin our Q&A session.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America.\nJustin Post: Great, thank you for taking my question. Clearly, it's a tough environment for the digital economy overall. Can you talk about one of the some of the bigger first quarter revenue headwinds from Snap from a macro perspective? And then, can you go into the monetization changes that you're making in the quarter that could have a positive longer impact on the model? Thank you.\nEvan Spiegel: Thanks, Justin. Hey, its Evan. From our recent conversations with our partners, it seems like advertising demand hasn't really improved, but it hasn't gotten significantly worse, either. I mean, obviously, the brand spend is significantly reduced, like we saw in the quarter, but our direct response business continued to grow in Q4. And in general, it seems like our partners are just managing their spend very cautiously so that they can react quickly to any changes in the environment. I think as we look at Q1, the most significant impact thus far have really been the changes we're making to our ad platform. Maybe just like taking a step back here. It's really been on a journey re-architecting our ad platform. We shared a lot over the last year about our improvements to observability and measurability of conversions, things like our conversions API, or data cleanrooms, and multi-party computation, of course, our pixel implementation for e-commerce advertisers. I think we have made good progress there, conversion API adoption continues to grow nicely. And the majority of our revenue is now measured using signals from conversions API, pixel integration scan, or MMPs. And so a lot of what we've been doing is taking this improved measurability and using it to improve the value of those conversions. And so some of the things we've shipped recently in Q1 at the beginning of the quarter are big changes to our in app UI, which we believe will help improve consideration because it aligns the ad UI with the more organic content experience. We've done a lot of work to improve our in-app Web View performance, which we believe can help contribute to improved conversions on the platform. We've updated our user ID graph, which helps improve attribution as well. And some of the early results are promising. So for example, pixel advertisers utilizing one-zero attribution. For them clicks are 40% more likely to result in a conversion. We're also seeing stuff like higher dwell times, higher non-bounce rates, and higher third-party match rate. So overall, obviously, the results are early, but we're excited about these changes we are making. And then, what we're doing is, we're taking our machine learning models, and we're training them on these higher value conversions, which will hopefully help us scale the overall number of those conversions over time. But the net-net, the impact in the short-term is really, that advertisers are experiencing these higher value conversions, but there are fewer of them as our models retrain, and hopefully, as we progress through the quarter, we can improve and increase that volume overall. And obviously, in addition to larger advertisers, these changes really benefits smaller advertisers who are much more reliant on last click conversions for measurement, maybe because they haven't implemented our conversions API, or don't have a data cleanroom, for example. So, this I think, of course, is a near-term headwind to the business, but we're very excited about the long-term potential of these changes, and we're working really hard on it.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Mark Shmulik with Alliance Bernstein.\nMark Shmulik: Yes, thanks for taking the question. So it looks like time spent on content globally was off, I think led by \u2013\nOperator: My apologies, Mark has dropped. The next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed.\nRoss Sandler: Hey. I've got a high-level technology question. You guys have been stating forever that you're a camera company. And we've seen an explosion in these new generative AI tools. How do you see those impacting your business? We have examples of Midjourney inside of Discord driving up engagement for them. Do you see the same kind of opportunity inside of Snap? Or do you view this as possibly a risk if people are going to the camera less? How do you see this impacting Snap over the next like, five years? Thanks a lot.\nEvan Spiegel: Thanks, Ross. We're so excited about the opportunity around generative AI, it's a huge opportunity for us. And we're already investing a ton. A lot of our most sophisticated AR lenses use generative AI technology. And we also see a lot of opportunities just to make our camera more powerful with generative AI. I mean, some simple examples are like improving the resolution and clarity of a Snap after you capture it, or even much more extreme transformations or editing images or Snaps based on a text input. But, if we think longer term, five years, as you mentioned, this is going to be critical to the growth of augmented reality. So, today, if you look at AR, there's just a real limitation on what you can build an AR, because there's a limited number of 3D models that have been created by artists. And we can use generative AI to help build more of these 3D models very quickly, which can really unlock the full potential of AR and help people make their imagination real in the world. You can imagine playing around with your kids wearing AR glasses and pointing. \u201coh my gosh, there's a pirate ship and a big monster.\u201d And we can bring those to life using generative art, which I think is really exciting. And then, of course, we're also thinking about how to integrate those tools into Lens Studio. We saw a lot of success, integrating Snap ML tools into Lens Studio. And it's really enabled creators to build some incredible things. We now have 300,000 craters who built more than 3 million lenses in Lens Studio. So the democratization of these tools, I think, will also be very powerful.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Richard Greenfield with LightShed Partners.\nRichard Greenfield: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. One, I guess I want to just follow back on the initial topic of this, DR was up 4% in Q4, which is actually a pretty encouraging number. But it sounds like you're talking about in Q1 based on your guidance. The changes you're making are going to drive that DR to go from, up forward to down something. Can you just help us better understand, as a DR flywheel and your investment start to kick in, why is it not driving sort of accelerated spend? Why is it actually hurting? I know you've heard a little bit about in the letter, but I think there's a lot of confusion of sort of why that inflection to the negative in DR as your sort of investing to improve it. And then, just on engagement, you made a comment that global time spent was up on content. Was that true in the U.S.? Or was that more of a global comment? And then on friends' stories, you said it was down in Q4? Is that TikTok reels, Shorts, just any color on what's driving sort of the pressure on friends' stories in Q4 would be great.\nEvan Spiegel: Hey, thanks, Rich. There's a lot in there. So let me see if I can get to all of that. I think, at a high level on the DR business, as I mentioned, the key here is that we're really improving the overall value of those conversions. But, as a result of volume of those conversions has decreased as our models relearn on the conversions that were driving, and hopefully, obviously we can expand that volume over time. But it's also requiring advertisers to adapt, for example, so they need to see that increased volume show up, excuse me, that increased value show up in their third party measurement tools, for example. And then, go in and increase their bids to reflect that increased value. And so overall, that sort of disruption, and again, when you layer in, of course, the changes to the app UI, and even things like our sales reorg channel redesign this quarter, it's a lot all at once. But frankly, we'd rather rip the band aid. And so, we waited to release a lot of these changes. In q1, I know Jerry has been eager to make a lot of these changes. But we know that that Q4 is critically important for our advertising partners, it's just vital to their businesses. And so we held a lot of those changes to Q1, and we're making them all at once. So they're disruptive, but I think the really exciting thing is that, it is having the intended impact in terms of value to advertisers. And frankly, the expected impact in terms of the disruption to our business. So, we're going to continue to work through it but again, the improvements we're seeing in terms of third-party match rates, dwell time, non-bounce rates that's all really exciting. I think an overall an input to improving return on advertising spend for our advertising partners. And then, I think I said about content time spent so I'd say overall content viewers continue to grow content products, including Spotlight, friends' stories, creator stories, partner content. That's true in the U.S. as well where our content viewership is growing, and globally overall, time spent watching content on the platform continues to grow. But time spent watching friends' stories does continue to be a headwind to total time spent. So if you think about our investments here and what we're doing to re-accelerate time spent with content, the most important thing is really increasing Spotlight viewership and engagement. We think we've got a lot of headroom here. We're excited about the 100% year-over-year growth on time spent and 30% year-over-year growth in Spotlight MAU. We're also continuing to invest in new creator tools and growing our creator ecosystem to increase creator content supply and diversity. That was definitely a bright spot in the U.S. where time spent watching creator stories grew 10%, year-over-year in Q4. And then, we're making a lot of product improvements and innovations around friends' stories, including things like community stories, which we think are really valuable to our community. And then, lastly, obviously onboarding new media partners who are driving significant viewership and time spent as we shared in the letter. I do think short video competition is going to continue to be very intense. Our community loves watching entertaining short videos. So what we're really trying to do here is just play to our strengths around our camera and messaging. We benefit from the enormous amount of video creation happening on our platform. Over 5 billion Snaps created every day, and this network of close friends who really enjoy sharing videos across our platform. So I think we'll continue to play to our strengths there. It's part of what's contributing to the great growth we're seeing, in spotlight.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. Just to kind of go back to the ad disruption in the near-term kind of laid out on Page nine. I guess one of the questions I have maybe I'm just not really understanding it, is the way to think about this, the value of the advertisers is going up, because in the near-term, you're sort of increasing the effective ad load. So we should think about platform wide pricing going down in the near-term. Is that right? Or am I sort of off there, is the first one. Then the second thing, one of the important aspects of driving direct response business and sort of data capture and being able to build cohorts of users? Can you just talk to us about some of the data capture that you already have and how you think about the potential to sort of cohort these users to drive a large DR business? Thanks.\nDerek Andersen: Hey, Brian. It's Derek speaking. I'll take the first one. Just in terms of what we're seeing in terms of inventory and the experience there, what you're effectively seeing is we've had some growth of impressions just as we've invested in the creator stories product in particular, that's been very popular, both from posting, and from an engagement perspective. And you've seen that contribute, sounds fairly an ad load is driven by positive engagement with their product. And then in terms of, what we're seeing in sort of the overall ecosystem of the auction, what we're doing here is using our inventory significantly more efficiently. And so that has the effect of actually returning impressions back into the auction, which have to be absorbed across other GDBs. And sort of puts downward pressure, all else being equal on the contestation and the auction. And so, obviously, that increases the opportunity for ROAs and return for advertisers. And all else being equal, we're seeing that do is translate into lower CPMs in the short-term. But the improvements that we're making to the DR platform and translating into longer dwell times, lower bounce rates, and some of the metrics that have been shared with you. Short earlier, really are improving the value of the auctions we're driving. And so that is more performative for the advertisers. So in the very near-term, this disruption comes through with the pressure on the supply and the disruption to the volumes that are being driven, but the value is clearly higher. And we can see that already coming through. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit more context on what's happening in the sort of supply demand environment there. I'll turn it over to Jerry, for the second part of your question.\nJerry Hunter: Yes. Thanks, Derek. Brian, thanks for the question. Let me just give you a little about how we think about this data. So we have a bunch of ways that we're collecting data. So conversion API, pixel, data cleanrooms. It's like Evan talked about earlier, multi-party computation, scan and MMP. And all of these signals feed into our system and give us a better view of what's happening with customers and conversions. Add to that the changes that we made to the Web View and to the ad format, so we get better signal about how our customers are interacting with our product. These all come together to train our ML. And that gives us better targeting over time. So the way we think about this is sort of a circle where there's constantly information that's coming in. We make changes in each of these products, as well as making changes -- customers make changes to their campaigns, and then we make changes to the ad format, we feed it into the ML and this sort of circle gives us better and better targeting over time, which we think still leads to better CPMs across the board and better ROAs for our customers.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore.\nMark Mahaney: Okay, thanks. I think I just asked one question on the monetization of Spotlight. It's something that's gone back and forth on for a while now. What's the -- I don't want to see, what's the holdup in monetizing spotlight, but I do kind of want to ask that, like -- what are the factors that you're looking for, that allow you to be a little bit more aggressive in monetizing what's clearly a really strong growth asset for you? I know you don't want to under undermine the user experience, but when do you make that on-off decision or that full on decision? Thank you.\nDerek Andersen: Hey, Mark. This is Derek speaking. I can take that question for you. I think for context, just to start, and I hinted at this a little earlier in the prior question. We definitely believe that we are demand constrained and not supply constrained at the moment. And just sort of put a finer point on that, we saw 8% impression growth in the most recent quarter, and that translated into a 9% decline in eCPM. So clearly, demand is the sort of lacking portion of things there. And obviously, that's why so much focus is on improvement in the DR business so that we can utilize our inventory and monetize it, take share. I think we're pleased with what we're seeing also in the growth and supply already. The investments that we made in creator stories in the most recent quarter translated into really solid volumes on posting and that translated into really good engagement. And so that's driven from impression growth in the most recent quarter that we're really pleased about. In terms of Spotlight, though, to answer your question, specifically, we did share last quarter that we would be expanding the testing of Spotlight monetization. And we did do that in Q4 and we're pleased with what we saw. It remains really early in that testing. But in the testing, we've seen thus far, the yield we're getting on ad served in the Spotlight is equal to and in some cases, higher than the yield we're realizing currently for similar ads elsewhere in the app. So again, this is really early. But that's very encouraging data in terms of what it means for our optimism about the potential for Spotlight to become a really meaningful portion of our overall content business in the future. So we're going to continue to advance our testing on Spotlight in the months ahead and continue to optimize the ad experience for both our community and advertising partners. But as I said earlier, given we are demand constrained, the urgency to ramp up monetization, there is limited and focusing on the advertiser and the customer experience is the most important thing in the very near-term.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe if I can pivot to the cost side of the equation and just try to tie a few loose ends together. So it sounds like Evan earlier said, there's obviously some key areas to invest in, that will act as a headwind to margins, even as you exit '22 and go into '23. You've obviously done a cost cutting initiative coming out of '22. And then, there's elements of the business would improve on the back of the DR initiatives, as we move through 2023. Can we get a little more granular on some of the headwinds versus the tail winds and the cost structure and tying it back to how we should be thinking about leverage in the business when you think about your investment cadence versus sort of implementation of the cost cutting initiative, and then an improved revenue profile was removed through 23? Thanks so much.\nDerek Andersen: Hey, Eric. It\u2019s Derek speaking. I can take that one. I think to start off, when we approach the reprioritization, that we announced near the end of Q3, where we shared that we were going to be removing $500 million from the cash cost structure. I think it's important to just understand that we were very thoughtful in our approach about that, because we really wanted to achieve two goals. One is, we wanted to make sure that we were clearly building a path to adjusted EBITDA profitability and positive free cash flow, even at lower growth rates. But we also wanted to make sure that each of our three strategic priorities were fully funded. So that we were fully funding the efforts to continue to grow our community and deepen engagement, the work that we're doing to improve our DR platform in order to accelerate revenue growth, as well as the efforts around diversifying our revenue growth just see with Snapchat plus. And then also, of course, being able to continue to invest in the long-term AR business. And so what you can see as we've been able to make sure that we have a cost structure that fully funds those three priorities, but we're still on track to deliver all of the $500 million in cost reduction. So the first 50 million there is coming out of fixed content reductions. And you should see that fully reflected in the fixed component of the content costs in Q1. And similarly, on the cash operating cost structure, the objective there was to remove $450 million. And we were continuing to wind down various operations through the course of Q4. So you'll see the full benefit of that cost reduction again, in Q1, just as we anticipated. For example, our actual headcount numbers are -- at the end of the current quarter are down 20%, from the peak in Q2. So it gives you a sense of the progress we've made and managing down the cost structure and getting ourselves to the prioritized cost structure. So then going forward, first, it's like, we remain long-term oriented when we're thinking about the investments in the business. So there are going to be things that are incredibly compelling for us to invest in, in the business. And for example, we just made the investment in creator stories, obviously, a very compelling investment, immediately resulting in an 8% increase in inventory. So there are going to be investments like that along the way that are incredibly compelling. What we have to do is remain one very disciplined on the aggregate cost structure, and very focused on prioritizing our investments to make sure that we maintain that path to adjusted EBITDA profitability and consistent free cash flow generation. It's now our third consecutive year of adjusted EBITDA profitability, second consecutive year of positive free cash flow. And that's important to controlling, our financial destiny going forward and making sure that we can fund the investments in the future of our business. And also making sure that we have the cash and cash flow to manage any dilution that we experience in the business. But you see, we've been active in doing. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of like, where we are on the reprioritization of the cost structure and funding our priorities, but also how we're thinking about balancing that discipline going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Lloyd Walmsley with UBS.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thanks. Two, if I can. First, you've talked a lot about the headwinds to time spent in friends' stories, but can you just talk about what you're seeing in the core chat experiences? Are you seeing growth in whether it's time per user, visits per day per user in that core kind of anchor engagement that feeds the whole business? And then, the second one was just in the letter, you mentioned, discover content, moving into more places? Curious if you expect this to be more of a driver of engagement or monetization, or both? Have you started doing anything that you can kind of share early learnings with us here. Thanks.\nEvan Spiegel: Thanks, Lloyd for the question. Yes, we're incredibly excited about the momentum we're seeing around our messaging service, visual messaging is really core to the Snapchat experience, and what helps people connect with their friends and family, and of course, enhances their relationships. So we're really excited about that momentum there. And of course, the work that we're doing in our camera, around augmented reality and helping our community express themselves with AR lenses and try and get new utility out of augmented reality with things like try on as well. So those core experiences around the camera and messaging are obviously really exciting driving a lot of growth for us. And also things like the map, for example, as we mentioned, I believe in the letter, Q4 Snapchatters open places on the map more than twice as often as they did in Q4 of 2021. So, definitely a lot of strong growth engagement around the core product value of messaging and we're really optimistic about some of the new products we have come in around that as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. I have two. First just to circle back on friends' stories and the strategy there. It sounds like part of the goal here is to get people to shift into Spotlight more? Is the idea to shift them into that tab in particular or to put Spotlight videos within friends' stories? And then can you also just talk about how revenue sharing with creators will work on Spotlight? Thanks.\nEvan Spiegel: Yes, sure. So at a high level, what we're seeing with friends' stories is that people still really want to watch stories from their close friends and their family. It's more the longer tail of their friends where they prefer to watch a really entertaining video than maybe a story about somebody's day-to-day life. And so that's really where we're trying to understand where that sort of breakpoint is for different members of our community and help them discover Spotlight content sort of at that moment as they start to become less engaged with friends' stories. So some of that, for example, is creating entry points even in Discover, right, so that people can tap directly into Spotlight content from that four-tab content experience. And in addition, we're also helping drive folks to the Spotlight tab itself, especially. For example, if one of the creators they are following has posted a new Spotlight video, we can let folks know and bring them into spotlight that way. So that's, I think, kind of how we're thinking about driving more top of funnel to Spotlight at least in the near-term. As it pertains to revenue share with creators, we do a small amount of sort of content seating, for example, with sort of contests and things like that around Spotlight, but we have not yet rolled out sort of a large-scale revenue share. In fact, what we're seeing a lot of creators do is use Spotlight to get distribution for their stories, so to become discovered in Spotlight, drive people to subscribe to their creator stories where we then do revenue share with them. And that is actually, I think, quite beneficial both to our business and creators because that subscription model, it provides much more stable revenue for the creators. And I think that's something that they really value compared to Spotlight, which is a bit more hit driven. So if they've got a great hit video, they can use that to drive people to their story and then monetize that more durably over time and build that relationship with their audience.\nOperator: Thank you.

And we can see that already coming through. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit more context on what's happening in the sort of supply demand environment there. I'll turn it over to Jerry, for the second part of your question. Hey, Mark. This is Derek speaking. I can take that question for you.

            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Derek. Brian, thanks for the question. Let me just give you a little about how we think about this data. So we have a bunch of ways that we're collecting data. So conversion API, pixel, data cleanrooms. It's like Evan talked about earlier, multi-party computation, scan and MMP. And all of these signals feed into our system and give us a better view of what's happening with customers and conversions. Add to that the changes that we made to the Web View and to the ad format, so we get better signal about how our customers are interacting with our product. These all come together to train our ML. And that gives us better targeting over time. So the way we think about this is sort of a circle where there's constantly information that's coming in. We make changes in each of these products, as well as making changes -- customers make changes to their campaigns, and then we make changes to the ad format, we feed it into the ML and this sort of circle gives us better and better targeting over time, which we think still leads to better CPMs across the board and better ROAs for our customers."

            "content": "Hi, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. 2022 was a challenging year for our business as we continue to be impacted by macroeconomic headwinds, platform policy changes and increased competition. We've taken action to refocus our investments to support our three strategic priorities of growing our community and deepening their engagement with our products, accelerating and diversifying our revenue growth and investing in the future of augmented reality. We are focused on the most important inputs that we can control, delivering engaging experiences to Snapchatters and improving business outcomes for our advertising partners. We continue to drive strong growth in our community, ending the year at 375 million daily active users in Q4, an increase of 17% year-over-year. Our team continues to innovate rapidly in ways that support the growth of our community. For example, in Q4, we released communities to expand our content offering on-boarded several new media partners, double down on our progress with spotlight and launch new Snapchat Plus features each of which helps drive engagement across our service. For the full year, we generated $4.6 billion of revenue up 12% year-over-year and generated $1.3 billion in the quarter or flat year-over-year, reflecting the rapid deceleration in digital advertising growth. Direct response advertising is a critical way that many companies grow their businesses, as it is one of the most performant and measurable forms of advertising. We have made progress updating and improving our ad platform over the past year across three key areas, investing in observability and measurement, improving engagement and conversion quality, and increasing the volume of high-quality engagements and conversions. In the very near term, it will take time for these improvements to translate into improved top-line growth. Over the long term, we believe that delivering higher return on advertising spend and utilizing our inventory more efficiently are critical inputs to gaining share of wallet accelerating revenue growth and realizing the full ARPU potential of our business. We believe that the camera represents our greatest opportunity to improve the way people live and communicate. Over the last decade, we have made significant advances to our AR software and hardware that have enabled the growth of the sophisticated AR platform that we have today. Over 250 million Snapchatters engage with augmented reality every day on average, and we are investing rapidly and thoughtfully in the future of AR to further expand our leadership position. We continued our path to sustainable profitability by generating $378 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2022 achieving our third consecutive year of positive adjusted EBITDA. We also generated $55 million of free cash flow in 2022, achieving our second consecutive year of positive free cash flow. 2022 brought significant challenges for our business and we have emerged with a highly engaged and growing community, a more focused team and cost structure a clear path to delivering sustained adjusted EBITDA profitability and positive free cash flow and a strong balance sheet with $3.9 billion in cash and marketable securities. We begin 2023 focused on executing against our three strategic priorities of growing our community and deepening their engagement with our products, accelerating and diversifying our revenue growth and investing in the future of augmented reality. We look forward to sharing more about our progress and plans at our upcoming Investors Day on February 16, at our offices in Santa Monica. Thank you. And with that, we will begin our Q&A session. Thanks, Justin. Hey, its Evan. From our recent conversations with our partners, it seems like advertising demand hasn't really improved, but it hasn't gotten significantly worse, either. I mean, obviously, the brand spend is significantly reduced, like we saw in the quarter, but our direct response business continued to grow in Q4. And in general, it seems like our partners are just managing their spend very cautiously so that they can react quickly to any changes in the environment. I think as we look at Q1, the most significant impact thus far have really been the changes we're making to our ad platform. Maybe just like taking a step back here. It's really been on a journey re-architecting our ad platform. We shared a lot over the last year about our improvements to observability and measurability of conversions, things like our conversions API, or data cleanrooms, and multi-party computation, of course, our pixel implementation for e-commerce advertisers. I think we have made good progress there, conversion API adoption continues to grow nicely. And the majority of our revenue is now measured using signals from conversions API, pixel integration scan, or MMPs. And so a lot of what we've been doing is taking this improved measurability and using it to improve the value of those conversions. And so some of the things we've shipped recently in Q1 at the beginning of the quarter are big changes to our in app UI, which we believe will help improve consideration because it aligns the ad UI with the more organic content experience. We've done a lot of work to improve our in-app Web View performance, which we believe can help contribute to improved conversions on the platform. We've updated our user ID graph, which helps improve attribution as well. And some of the early results are promising. So for example, pixel advertisers utilizing one-zero attribution. For them clicks are 40% more likely to result in a conversion. We're also seeing stuff like higher dwell times, higher non-bounce rates, and higher third-party match rate. So overall, obviously, the results are early, but we're excited about these changes we are making. And then, what we're doing is, we're taking our machine learning models, and we're training them on these higher value conversions, which will hopefully help us scale the overall number of those conversions over time. But the net-net, the impact in the short-term is really, that advertisers are experiencing these higher value conversions, but there are fewer of them as our models retrain, and hopefully, as we progress through the quarter, we can improve and increase that volume overall. And obviously, in addition to larger advertisers, these changes really benefits smaller advertisers who are much more reliant on last click conversions for measurement, maybe because they haven't implemented our conversions API, or don't have a data cleanroom, for example. So, this I think, of course, is a near-term headwind to the business, but we're very excited about the long-term potential of these changes, and we're working really hard on it. Thanks, Ross. We're so excited about the opportunity around generative AI, it's a huge opportunity for us. And we're already investing a ton. A lot of our most sophisticated AR lenses use generative AI technology. And we also see a lot of opportunities just to make our camera more powerful with generative AI. I mean, some simple examples are like improving the resolution and clarity of a Snap after you capture it, or even much more extreme transformations or editing images or Snaps based on a text input. But, if we think longer term, five years, as you mentioned, this is going to be critical to the growth of augmented reality. So, today, if you look at AR, there's just a real limitation on what you can build an AR, because there's a limited number of 3D models that have been created by artists. And we can use generative AI to help build more of these 3D models very quickly, which can really unlock the full potential of AR and help people make their imagination real in the world. You can imagine playing around with your kids wearing AR glasses and pointing. \u201coh my gosh, there's a pirate ship and a big monster.\u201d And we can bring those to life using generative art, which I think is really exciting. And then, of course, we're also thinking about how to integrate those tools into Lens Studio. We saw a lot of success, integrating Snap ML tools into Lens Studio. And it's really enabled creators to build some incredible things. We now have 300,000 craters who built more than 3 million lenses in Lens Studio. So the democratization of these tools, I think, will also be very powerful. Hey, thanks, Rich. There's a lot in there. So let me see if I can get to all of that. I think, at a high level on the DR business, as I mentioned, the key here is that we're really improving the overall value of those conversions. But, as a result of volume of those conversions has decreased as our models relearn on the conversions that were driving, and hopefully, obviously we can expand that volume over time. But it's also requiring advertisers to adapt, for example, so they need to see that increased volume show up, excuse me, that increased value show up in their third party measurement tools, for example. And then, go in and increase their bids to reflect that increased value. And so overall, that sort of disruption, and again, when you layer in, of course, the changes to the app UI, and even things like our sales reorg channel redesign this quarter, it's a lot all at once. But frankly, we'd rather rip the band aid. And so, we waited to release a lot of these changes. In q1, I know Jerry has been eager to make a lot of these changes. But we know that that Q4 is critically important for our advertising partners, it's just vital to their businesses. And so we held a lot of those changes to Q1, and we're making them all at once. So they're disruptive, but I think the really exciting thing is that, it is having the intended impact in terms of value to advertisers. And frankly, the expected impact in terms of the disruption to our business. So, we're going to continue to work through it but again, the improvements we're seeing in terms of third-party match rates, dwell time, non-bounce rates that's all really exciting. I think an overall an input to improving return on advertising spend for our advertising partners. And then, I think I said about content time spent so I'd say overall content viewers continue to grow content products, including Spotlight, friends' stories, creator stories, partner content. That's true in the U.S. as well where our content viewership is growing, and globally overall, time spent watching content on the platform continues to grow. But time spent watching friends' stories does continue to be a headwind to total time spent. So if you think about our investments here and what we're doing to re-accelerate time spent with content, the most important thing is really increasing Spotlight viewership and engagement. We think we've got a lot of headroom here. We're excited about the 100% year-over-year growth on time spent and 30% year-over-year growth in Spotlight MAU. We're also continuing to invest in new creator tools and growing our creator ecosystem to increase creator content supply and diversity. That was definitely a bright spot in the U.S. where time spent watching creator stories grew 10%, year-over-year in Q4. And then, we're making a lot of product improvements and innovations around friends' stories, including things like community stories, which we think are really valuable to our community. And then, lastly, obviously onboarding new media partners who are driving significant viewership and time spent as we shared in the letter. I do think short video competition is going to continue to be very intense. Our community loves watching entertaining short videos. So what we're really trying to do here is just play to our strengths around our camera and messaging. We benefit from the enormous amount of video creation happening on our platform. Over 5 billion Snaps created every day, and this network of close friends who really enjoy sharing videos across our platform. So I think we'll continue to play to our strengths there. It's part of what's contributing to the great growth we're seeing, in spotlight. Thanks, Lloyd for the question. Yes, we're incredibly excited about the momentum we're seeing around our messaging service, visual messaging is really core to the Snapchat experience, and what helps people connect with their friends and family, and of course, enhances their relationships. So we're really excited about that momentum there. And of course, the work that we're doing in our camera, around augmented reality and helping our community express themselves with AR lenses and try and get new utility out of augmented reality with things like try on as well. So those core experiences around the camera and messaging are obviously really exciting driving a lot of growth for us. And also things like the map, for example, as we mentioned, I believe in the letter, Q4 Snapchatters open places on the map more than twice as often as they did in Q4 of 2021. So, definitely a lot of strong growth engagement around the core product value of messaging and we're really optimistic about some of the new products we have come in around that as well. Yes, sure. So at a high level, what we're seeing with friends' stories is that people still really want to watch stories from their close friends and their family. It's more the longer tail of their friends where they prefer to watch a really entertaining video than maybe a story about somebody's day-to-day life. And so that's really where we're trying to understand where that sort of breakpoint is for different members of our community and help them discover Spotlight content sort of at that moment as they start to become less engaged with friends' stories. So some of that, for example, is creating entry points even in Discover, right, so that people can tap directly into Spotlight content from that four-tab content experience. And in addition, we're also helping drive folks to the Spotlight tab itself, especially. For example, if one of the creators they are following has posted a new Spotlight video, we can let folks know and bring them into spotlight that way. So that's, I think, kind of how we're thinking about driving more top of funnel to Spotlight at least in the near-term. As it pertains to revenue share with creators, we do a small amount of sort of content seating, for example, with sort of contests and things like that around Spotlight, but we have not yet rolled out sort of a large-scale revenue share. In fact, what we're seeing a lot of creators do is use Spotlight to get distribution for their stories, so to become discovered in Spotlight, drive people to subscribe to their creator stories where we then do revenue share with them. And that is actually, I think, quite beneficial both to our business and creators because that subscription model, it provides much more stable revenue for the creators. And I think that's something that they really value compared to Spotlight, which is a bit more hit driven. So if they've got a great hit video, they can use that to drive people to their story and then monetize that more durably over time and build that relationship with their audience."

With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Evan.\nEvan Spiegel: Hi, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. While our business continued to face significant headwinds this quarter, we took action to further focus our business on our three strategic priorities of growing our community and deepening their engagement with our products, reaccelerating and diversifying our revenue growth, and investing in augmented reality. We believe that we can be successful in this new operating environment, but we must rigorously prioritize our investments and continue to delight our community with our products while driving success for our advertising partners. Growing our community and engagement is one of our most important inputs to long-term success because it increases our overall revenue opportunity and strengthens our network effects. Our team remains focused on expanding our product offering and deepening engagement with our global community, which increased 19% year-over-year to reach 363 million daily active users. Our revenue grew 6% year-over-year to $1.13 billion, and we generated adjusted EBITDA of $73 million and free cash flow of $18 million. We are focused on increasing our share of wallet as growth in the overall digital advertising segment slows by working to increase the return on advertising spend delivered by our direct response advertising platform as we believe these are the most defensible advertising budgets in a challenged economic environment. To achieve this, we are investing in driving scalable, lower funnel performance for our advertising partners and making improvements to our ad platform and Auction Dynamics so that we can continue to deliver strong returns on advertising spend. Our camera has evolved into a leading platform for augmented reality. Our AR products and services are already driving a major impact at scale today as Snapchatters use our services to shop, play, learn, explore and entertain themselves. This quarter, we announced several new valuable partnerships, innovative AR experiences and new AR features and capabilities in Lens Studio. Over 250 million people engage with augmented reality on Snapchat every day. Accelerating our lead in augmented reality helps us build a durable competitive advantage that comes from investing over the long term, building sophisticated technical tools and capabilities and growing a platform that is increasingly differentiated and difficult to replicate. This momentum and the creative energy of the Snapchat community makes us incredibly excited about the future of augmented reality. As part of our reprioritization efforts, we have reorganized our team to better meet the challenges of the current environment and to make as much progress as possible as quickly as possible in the areas of our business that we are able to control. In particular, there is a significant opportunity to improve coordination and prioritization across our engineering, sales and product teams. In an effort to realize this opportunity, we promoted Jerry Hunter to Chief Operating Officer. Jerry leads our monetization efforts across our three operating regions, EMEA, APAC and Americas as well as our engineering, growth, partnerships and content, AR enterprise and SMB teams. Jerry has repeatedly demonstrated operational rigor at scale, leading our business through several challenging transitions, including the build-out of our advertising platform, the rebuild of our Android product, our infrastructure optimizations and most recently, significant investments in our platform integrity team. With that, I\u2019m excited to introduce Jerry.\nJerry Hunter: Thanks, Evan, and thank you, everybody, for joining our call. I see significant opportunities for our business in the years ahead. As a business, our primary focus is on driving lower funnel performance and improving yield of our inventory for advertising partners. We\u2019re working to improve optimization against lower funnel objectives to drive more conversions and innovating on our advertising formats in order to make them more native and engaging. Improving our product and technical performance of our advertising platform requires tight collaboration and teamwork across sales, product and engineering. Our renewed focus will be on creating alignment across our teams to ensure that feedback from clients helps inform our product road map and that each of our teams is more directly accountable for advertiser success. After years of rapid growth in the size of our team, we\u2019re focused on driving productivity in our sales organization and improving our go-to-market with more clarity about the role that Snapchat plays in the lives of our community and how we can help businesses grow. We will listen to our clients, clearly understand their challenges and opportunities and demonstrate how Snapchat can play a meaningful role in driving their success. We\u2019re also working hard to deliver new revenue-generating opportunities, including Spotlight, augmented reality advertising and our Snapchat+ subscription service. We\u2019re expanding our advertising test within Spotlight in Q4, especially as we see many opportunities to introduce advertising formats that align well with this new content viewing experience. With hundreds of millions of people using AR every day, we have a huge opportunity to help businesses reach their customers with immersive and engaging augmented reality experiences. Snapchat+ represents an exciting opportunity to diversify our revenue streams outside of advertising. And we have a direct ability to increase subscribers with new product features and by driving awareness of our subscription offering. I couldn\u2019t be more excited to be here at Snap, and I look forward to sharing more about our plans for 2022 and beyond. Thank you. And with that, we can begin our Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe I\u2019ll do a 2-parter, if I can. I think, first, Evan, what people still want to hear is sort of looking back over the last four, five quarters as Apple made the policy changes they did and the industry has been in this sort of transformative mode over the last 12-plus months, what have been some of the key learnings of where you found the infrastructure and the ad product maybe less well positioned in terms of what\u2019s happened from an industry shift standpoint? And turning to the forward timetable, you\u2019ve obviously laid out an investment plan to sort of reposition the ad product for the long term. Can we get a better sense of like where you are in the process of repositioning the ad platform for the medium to long term? And how should we be thinking about what the pathway is in terms of headwinds versus tailwinds from a monetization standpoint? Thanks.\nEvan Spiegel: Thanks, Eric. Yes. So at a high level, we\u2019re focused on building our business for the long term. And that means that we really put our community at the center of everything that we do, and we innovate to offer products that add value to people\u2019s lives by empowering them to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world and have fun together. And that long-term perspective is really what informs our strategy as we think about navigating this difficult macro environment that has impacted our advertising business over the past few quarters. So, we made the decision to reprioritize and focus our investments on our three strategic priorities: growing our community and their engagement; reaccelerating and diversifying our revenue; and investing in augmented reality. And these changes should allow us to drive continued growth in our community while delivering free cash flow even with low levels of revenue growth. And that gives us a lot more flexibility to focus on the long term in an environment where the cost of capital has increased quite dramatically. There\u2019s a lot of opportunity to generate incremental revenue across our platform, whether that\u2019s our AR platform, Spotlight or the Map. We\u2019ve also been growing our Snapchat+ subscription service, which is another way that we deliver value to our community and allows us to monetize the high levels of engagement that we have across our service. Operationally, our advertising business has become a lot more technically complex over the past few years as advertisers are working to better measure and optimize their campaigns. That means that we need to drive increased coordination across our sales, engineering and product teams, which is one of the reasons I\u2019m so excited to have Jerry leading these teams as our COO. I\u2019ve already observed a significant change in the way that our teams are working together, and I\u2019m really pleased to see the focus on our advertising customers driving everything that they do. I mean, tactically, really, that means working to make conversions on our platform more observable and easier to measure, whether that\u2019s more on platform or click-through conversions, improvements to our first-party tooling, third-party tooling and partnerships, ad format improvements, ML and optimization improvements, and of course, continuing to grow our inventory. We saw about an 8% increase in impressions year-over-year in the quarter, which is really a function of daily active users and engagements. And then, as we\u2019re looking to the future, we\u2019ve really tried to make sure that all of our investments are lined up against those three strategic priorities that I mentioned, community growth, revenue growth and AR. And that\u2019s really how we\u2019re going to be working through this challenging environment.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak, Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: I have two maybe. Jerry, let me ask you a couple. So just can you give us some examples of one or two of the most important steps that you see yourself focusing on to really improve the performance-driven business and how quickly that business can ramp within the overall mix, this blocking and tackling? Then the second one, with U.S. time spent down 5% and really the core Snap Story seem to be what are in decline. How do you think about sort of differentiating the pitch to advertisers and even users as your engagement is increasingly driven by short-form video and long-form video? Thanks.\nJerry Hunter: Thanks for the question, Brian. I\u2019m excited about the opportunities we have for our business. Advertising has become more technical as signals and measurement continue to evolve. Actually, I have three things I want to tell you about. First is building up the connective tissue between sales, engineering and product. That includes feedback mechanisms in the product from sales and customers and better go-to-market planning that ensures customer success in our platform. Two is continuing to strengthen our DR business, which we know is more defensible, both in good and challenging times. We\u2019ll do this by continuing to drive our first-party measurement, and we\u2019re seeing strong adoption by our top advertisers, making our systems work better with third-party measurement systems like Google Analytics and continuing to improve personalization and optimization. And the third thing is bringing top talent to our three president roles for the Americas, APAC and EMEA. One of them Ronan Harris is going to join us next week. This will ensure that we\u2019re improving our focus on customers in every region and getting closer to the customers\u2019 needs. I think these priorities will set Snap up to be successful in this current environment.\nEvan Spiegel: Yes, I can speak a little bit to the content trends that we\u2019re seeing in the U.S. and more broadly. So, at a very high level, both in the U.S. and globally, viewership is up. And so that means that our overall opportunity is expanding if we can continue to increase folks\u2019 depth of engagement. And that\u2019s really important, of course, for advertisers who really value the reach that we provide. Looking more specifically at Stories, what we\u2019re finding is that while people continue to engage at really high levels with Stories from their close friends or private stories, especially from people that are really important to them, that depth of story engagement you get to your 200th friend or something like that, at some point, content on Spotlight or Discover is maybe more engaging or more interesting. And so, what we\u2019re trying to do is help people transition from that friend story content that really drives that healthy top of funnel and funnel and viewership to content in Spotlight and Discover. And both of those are growing nicely. Spotlight, of course, is growing very rapidly year-over-year and we\u2019re excited about that. I think as it pertains to advertisers, as I mentioned, they\u2019re really looking for reach but they\u2019re also looking for performance, especially in this period of time, which is why we focus so heavily on evolving our direct response business and making sure that we\u2019re really delivering return on ad spend for our partners. I think there are going to be some unique opportunities with things like Spotlight, for example, where smaller advertisers can experiment with content, submitting content to Spotlight, seeing how it performs. And then, if they get some traction there and get feedback from our community, they may want to turn into a direct response advertising unit and manage that through our ad platform. So I do think some of the content investments we\u2019re making provide new and unique opportunities for advertisers, but really, especially in this environment, the focus is going to be on reach and performance.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Rich Greenfield with LightShed Partners.\nRichard Greenfield: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I want this one specifically for Evan. I guess, it\u2019s pretty obvious that you\u2019re a sticky utility for photo-based messaging, especially among sort of your core demos. But you\u2019re clearly losing engagement time spent to TikTok and maybe even other camera apps that have come on to the scene like BeReal impacting sort of overall time spent per user per day than in turn monetization. Curious on the -- I guess the most important question for you, especially on the product side is how? Like, how do you get people to spend more time on Snapchat and especially more monetizable time spent on Snapchat? And like what is the plan for that in \u201823 because I think that\u2019s what investors are going to really be anchored on as they think about your stock over the next year.\nEvan Spiegel: Thanks, Rich. Yes. So, at a high level, as you pointed out, Snapchat provides an extremely valuable utility in terms of visual messaging but also across our service with things like the Map or our AR platform, and of course, content, as you also mentioned. And so, we\u2019ve really worked hard to diversify engagement across our products. And our application opens to the camera, so we\u2019ve got a real strength in visual communication and augmented reality that remains undermonetized, which is why we\u2019ve really focused on accelerating our revenue growth in augmented reality so that it\u2019s more commensurate with the engagement that we\u2019re seeing there. And we believe that the differentiated nature of our service is what\u2019s contributing to the daily active user growth which grew 19% year-over-year to 363 million daily active users. In terms of the content specifically, I think there\u2019s a lot of headroom, of course, to continue to grow content engagement. As I mentioned, viewership has expanded, and we\u2019re continuing to see a lot of demand for content and Spotlight, which is growing nicely and on our Discover platform. I think we can do a better job helping people transition from friend stories or private stories into those types of content. And relative to other services where people are spending a lot of time watching content, we believe we have a lot of headroom to increase content engagement, so working to improve content diversity and personalization to realize that opportunity. Overall, of course, impressions grew 8% year-over-year. So, we are seeing some progress there.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Mark Shmulik with Alliance Bernstein.\nMark Shmulik: A couple, if I may. First for Evan, I know with the leaked memo, there was kind of the numbers out there on internal expectations for 2023. Any color you can share just how that\u2019s changed, given this is a fast-evolving macro market and a lot of changes with kind of new executives like Jerry on board and kind of the plans in place there. And then secondly, Jerry, I just kind of think about kind of new levers of monetization. And I know we\u2019re talking about kind of Spotlight ads coming on board here in the fourth quarter. Any color you can share in just kind of the road map of what else is there to kind of really reaccelerate revenue growth? I kind of look at stats like Samsung phones, 2.5 billion Snaps. And so just how do we think about the Camera Kit and AR Kit being monetized as well?\nEvan Spiegel: Thanks, Mark. Yes, so that was an internal memo that we weren\u2019t intending to share publicly, and as such, had a number of aspirational goals really designed to rally the team, especially at a time when we\u2019re restructuring and refocusing our business, it\u2019s really important for our team to see the enormous opportunity that we have in front of us, whether that\u2019s reaccelerating our revenue growth by improving our direct response business, better monetizing the enormous amount of AR engagement that we see, obviously, in our camera, and continuing to grow and build on Snapchat+. So, we certainly see a lot of opportunity there, and the goal is really, as we look to 2023, inspiring our team. I remember some really challenging times in the past when expectations were really, really low. And internally, we tried to really inspire our team and that\u2019s what helped us deliver a 50% year-over-year revenue growth on average the last five years or so. So, I think especially in really challenging times, when we\u2019ve taken the necessary steps to make sure our business can be successful over the long term, inspiring the team is critically important. But those goals are internal and aspirational.\nJerry Hunter: I\u2019ll take the second part of that question. In addition to the work on AR and accelerating the business that Evan touched on, I just want to give you a sense of how we\u2019re refocusing and realigning sales engineering and product teams around the customer. So, let me give you an example of a program we started a couple of months back called the Reference Customer Program. The idea is to find customers that we want to ensure getting the most from our platform. We brought several SWAT teams together, a SWAT team that included folks from the account team, the engineering team and product teams to review every aspect of how the advertiser was using the platform. And we found that through this, we were able to help improve their implementation, better utilize features that are already in the platform, in a couple of cases, did a little bit of feature integration work. In all those cases, the customers had higher ROI than expected and they were happy with their results. Now we\u2019re in the process of rolling these successes out to other customers who might have similar opportunities. And I think that, that\u2019s just a product of this -- of bringing the teams together. So I think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity for us to just bring things together and take advantage of what we\u2019ve already got out there and have it implemented in a better way.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays.\nRoss Sandler: I just wanted to throw the macro question out. So, it sounds like it\u2019s mostly brand advertising that was weak in 3Q, and it seems like that\u2019s the area that\u2019s forecasted to really drop off as we kind of go forward here in 4Q. So, could you just maybe elaborate a little bit on what you\u2019re seeing? What\u2019s -- we can obviously see what\u2019s going on with the macro broadly, but specifically to like rest of this quarter, what commitments you\u2019re looking at that would cause those growth rates to kind of dip into the negative? And then, related to one of the prior questions, you\u2019re growing your DAUs almost 20% and impressions 8%. So, it seems like we\u2019ve just got a demand problem here, not a supply problem. Can you just talk to that a little bit? Thank you.\nDerek Andersen: Hey there. It\u2019s Derek speaking. Thanks for the question. One, yes, in Q3, the deceleration in revenue growth was really observed across both our direct response and the brand advertising business, with the direct response advertising growing modestly faster than the overall business, while the brand-oriented advertising business declined slightly year-over-year in the quarter. And then in Q4, as we look forward, we expect the brand business to play a bigger role in the decel that we anticipate to occur as we move through the quarter. And that being due to the fact that, number one, the growth rates were very high in the prior year but also it\u2019s a bigger portion of the business in Q4. I think stepping back, we\u2019ve seen revenue growth move around over the last several months but within a relatively tight range. So, we grew about 13% in Q2, but we saw that decelerate as we moved through the quarter. And this led us to sharing, when we reported last quarter, that the growth was approximately flat in the early portion of that quarter. By the end of August, when we shared 8-K about the restructuring, the quarter-to-date revenue had improved to about 8%, and so that implied things accelerated a bit. With the full quarter number at 6% this quarter, obviously, things slowed down into about the low single digits in September, so. And then we\u2019ve seen things move up a bit in the beginning of this quarter with the early weeks being at about 9%. And so, if you sort of take that together, what we\u2019re seeing is the growth rate has moved around month-to-month and accelerated or decelerated a couple of times. But we\u2019ve largely been range-bound here between flat and the low teens as we continue to navigate this really difficult operating environment. And I think the thing I\u2019d share here that\u2019s really important is something we\u2019ve talked about several times in recent quarters, which is that it\u2019s incredibly fast and easy for advertisers to turn digital performance advertising on and off as they seek to calibrate their investments and their own growth in their business. And that\u2019s part of what we\u2019re seeing here with the start-stop on the growth rates in the accel and decel that we\u2019ve experienced. So, as we\u2019re navigating this, it\u2019s incredibly important that we stay focused on the inputs that we control. And you heard a lot about that from Evan and Jerry earlier around the investments we\u2019re making to grow the community, the investments to improve the DR business and of course, things like Snapchat+, which are helping to diversify the top line growth and, of course, the future of AR. And then, to your other question, in terms of supply versus demand, we continue to believe we have a significant room to grow our advertising business. And so, I do believe that as you\u2019ve seen the macro challenges compound on some of the platform changes we saw last year, certainly, we\u2019ve been demand-challenged, and we continue to see a lot of opportunity to grow, grow our business with impressions as you see in the most recent quarter with those impressions growing but also through eCPMs as we can continue to get better at our direct response business, including optimization, personalization and ranking, which Jerry talked about a lot earlier. So, I agree with you on that point. Hopefully, all of that provides a little bit of context for your question.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with UBS.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thanks. First one is just you talked about expanding Spotlight test this quarter. You just talked about being kind of just demand-constrained. So, curious how you guys think it plays out if we think about adding inventory from spotlight, reducing eCPM? How responsive is the ad community to moving budget over as that ad load ramps and since CPMs come down? How easy is it for advertisers to shift that creative and see ROI in the spotlight format? And then second one, if I can. You talked about taking $450 million out of the cost base. I think it was kind of an exit 2Q annualized number. Can you just talk about what kind of growth we should expect on that new cost base in terms of either headcount inflation or other cost growth on this new base heading into \u201823? Thanks.\nDerek Andersen: It\u2019s Derek speaking. Thanks for the question. So, in terms of the first one around monetizing Spotlight, as we look into Q4, we will expand our advertising tests within spotlight. But in addition, businesses already have several mechanisms to test and learn directly within Spotlight, so businesses are able to submit content to Spotlight, see how it performs within our community, receive direct feedback from our user base and then use those learnings to inform their campaigns. We believe that this is a good example of how Spotlight offers an exciting new way for brands to experiment with their video creative and learn how to make content that inspires the community. We\u2019re also working on new tools that will enable businesses to easily promote their most engaging Spotlight content, drive conversations and then measure their success with ad managers. So, at a high level, we\u2019re really excited about the potential for Spotlight. But we also have a lot of room, as I just mentioned, to grow our advertising business regardless of how and when we ramp Spotlight ad load, sorry. So, we\u2019re ramping our testing judiciously there to make sure that we maximize the long-term value.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore.\nMark Mahaney: Two questions, please. First is, as you try to -- thoughts on Scan 4.0, when that comes out sometime this quarter, do you think your thoughts on whether that will help you or not? At the same time, I think you\u2019ve been trying to recover signal. You\u2019ve been doing a series of things to try to improve ad attribution, ad targeting. Just where are you on that? And then, you talked about ROI in the shareholder letter. Can you just quantify, like for people running campaigns, consistently running campaigns, how impaired is the ROI versus where it was kind of a year ago and the path to getting that back to levels that you had at that time? Thanks a lot.\nJerry Hunter: Hi. This is Jerry. Let me talk about that first one on Scan 4.0. To take a step back here, we think it\u2019s critical. Measurement is critical. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve invested so heavily in first- and third-party measurement. And Scan 4.0 is important. The coming changes are definitely need improvements to help advertisers achieve their business goals. And better campaign attribution and more granular reporting should give us even more headroom for improvement. For the ROI part of the question, we are constantly evolving the best way we serve our advertisers. We\u2019re continuing to update and improve our first-party measurement solutions, which are seeing continued adoption of our top advertisers. And they\u2019re seeing success on our platform as a result. We\u2019re also continuing to prove the way that third-party measurement systems like Google Analytics are reflecting conversions in our systems, and we\u2019re seeing positive results there, too. We\u2019re also driving our direct response ads to better convert right on our platform. That improvement is happening through more experimentation with ML and integrating data from our privacy protecting first-party measurement solutions so that our ranking and personalization are more effective. And I just -- I want to come back to the fact that this ad space is more technical, and it\u2019s just as important as the rest of these to talk about that integration between sales, engineering and product teams and the processes that ensure that our advertising partners are achieving success by cross-functional process, tighter lines of communication and faster responsiveness to their opportunities and challenges.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. Just on the brand side. I think many are curious kind of why brand will suffer so hard going into a seasonally strong period. Is this more macro-related? Is it -- given some of the restructuring, is that having some impact? And I guess, Evan, if you can also follow up on that. I know you -- there\u2019s been a lot of change. When do you expect that to kind of stabilize and that to flow through the system and you feel that you\u2019re on the right foundation from this restructuring activity?\nDerek Andersen: It\u2019s Derek speaking. I\u2019ll take the first part of that and then hand it up to Evan. I think first, just stepping back for context on Q4. Even flattish year-over-year revenue growth is about a 15% step-up on a quarter-over-quarter basis. So, we are expecting revenue to grow seasonally at a pretty good clip. So, the issue that we\u2019re seeing here is that if you look back to a year ago, we grew at over 40% year-over-year in the prior year. And many of the really significant macro impacts that we\u2019ve seen over the course of this year weren\u2019t impacting the business nearly as much as they were a year ago. So for example, the persistent inflation we\u2019ve seen this year, but the ramp in the Fed rate cycle as well as the onset of the war in Ukraine that really had an impact on growth rates as we moved into Q2. And so, while we\u2019re still expecting really pretty robust 15% approximately quarter-over-quarter growth in Q4, the comp to the prior year and the fact that the macro impacts have built up and compounded on each other over the course of this year is really making the back half of this quarter, number one, a little bit more difficult from a visibility point of view. And certainly, with the performance that we saw from the brand portion of the advertising business in Q3 gives the -- sort of informs our expectation of the decel to move through the rest of the quarter. So hopefully, that gives you a little more context on that side of things. I\u2019ll turn it over to Evan for the second portion there.\nEvan Spiegel: Hey. Thanks, Brent, for the question. Yes. I mean, these sorts of changes in restructurings are always challenging. And I\u2019m really just grateful to the team and really proud of how quickly they\u2019ve worked to adapt and really make sure we\u2019re focused on our key priorities. I think it\u2019s going to take a little bit of time. We certainly have regained some momentum and focus, but the process is still concluding in certain countries where regulations require that those processes take a little bit longer. So, I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re complete there. I think one thing I\u2019m watching specifically is on the sales side. We\u2019ve got these president roles. Ronan Harris is joining a bit later this month as our President of EMEA. We will also have an APAC President and an Americas President, and we\u2019ll be putting folks into those roles as soon as we can. And in addition to that, we\u2019re also thinking about how to better organize our sales teams to go to market in a way that best serves our customers. And we\u2019re sort of thinking about Q1 as the time line for that. So, we\u2019re certainly not done with this process because we see more opportunity to streamline and improve the way we serve our advertising partners. I know that\u2019s something Jerry is thinking a lot about. But overall, if you just look at how the team has managed through this period of time, I\u2019m really proud of the work they\u2019re doing and the progress we\u2019re making.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session as well as Snap Inc.\u2019s third quarter 2022 earnings conference call.

            "name": "Jerry Hunter",
            "content": "Thanks, Evan, and thank you, everybody, for joining our call. I see significant opportunities for our business in the years ahead. As a business, our primary focus is on driving lower funnel performance and improving yield of our inventory for advertising partners. We're working to improve optimization against lower funnel objectives to drive more conversions and innovating on our advertising formats in order to make them more native and engaging. Improving our product and technical performance of our advertising platform requires tight collaboration and teamwork across sales, product and engineering. Our renewed focus will be on creating alignment across our teams to ensure that feedback from clients helps inform our product road map and that each of our teams is more directly accountable for advertiser success. After years of rapid growth in the size of our team, we're focused on driving productivity in our sales organization and improving our go-to-market with more clarity about the role that Snapchat plays in the lives of our community and how we can help businesses grow. We will listen to our clients, clearly understand their challenges and opportunities and demonstrate how Snapchat can play a meaningful role in driving their success. We're also working hard to deliver new revenue-generating opportunities, including Spotlight, augmented reality advertising and our Snapchat+ subscription service. We're expanding our advertising test within Spotlight in Q4, especially as we see many opportunities to introduce advertising formats that align well with this new content viewing experience. With hundreds of millions of people using AR every day, we have a huge opportunity to help businesses reach their customers with immersive and engaging augmented reality experiences. Snapchat+ represents an exciting opportunity to diversify our revenue streams outside of advertising. And we have a direct ability to increase subscribers with new product features and by driving awareness of our subscription offering. I couldn't be more excited to be here at Snap, and I look forward to sharing more about our plans for 2022 and beyond. Thank you. And with that, we can begin our Q&A. Thanks for the question, Brian. I'm excited about the opportunities we have for our business. Advertising has become more technical as signals and measurement continue to evolve. Actually, I have three things I want to tell you about. First is building up the connective tissue between sales, engineering and product. That includes feedback mechanisms in the product from sales and customers and better go-to-market planning that ensures customer success in our platform. Two is continuing to strengthen our DR business, which we know is more defensible, both in good and challenging times. We'll do this by continuing to drive our first-party measurement, and we're seeing strong adoption by our top advertisers, making our systems work better with third-party measurement systems like Google Analytics and continuing to improve personalization and optimization. And the third thing is bringing top talent to our three president roles for the Americas, APAC and EMEA. One of them Ronan Harris is going to join us next week. This will ensure that we're improving our focus on customers in every region and getting closer to the customers' needs. I think these priorities will set Snap up to be successful in this current environment. I'll take the second part of that question. In addition to the work on AR and accelerating the business that Evan touched on, I just want to give you a sense of how we're refocusing and realigning sales engineering and product teams around the customer.

            "name": "Evan Spiegel",
            "content": "Hi, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. While our business continued to face significant headwinds this quarter, we took action to further focus our business on our three strategic priorities of growing our community and deepening their engagement with our products, reaccelerating and diversifying our revenue growth, and investing in augmented reality. We believe that we can be successful in this new operating environment, but we must rigorously prioritize our investments and continue to delight our community with our products while driving success for our advertising partners. Growing our community and engagement is one of our most important inputs to long-term success because it increases our overall revenue opportunity and strengthens our network effects. Our team remains focused on expanding our product offering and deepening engagement with our global community, which increased 19% year-over-year to reach 363 million daily active users. Our revenue grew 6% year-over-year to $1.13 billion, and we generated adjusted EBITDA of $73 million and free cash flow of $18 million. We are focused on increasing our share of wallet as growth in the overall digital advertising segment slows by working to increase the return on advertising spend delivered by our direct response advertising platform as we believe these are the most defensible advertising budgets in a challenged economic environment. To achieve this, we are investing in driving scalable, lower funnel performance for our advertising partners and making improvements to our ad platform and Auction Dynamics so that we can continue to deliver strong returns on advertising spend. Our camera has evolved into a leading platform for augmented reality. Our AR products and services are already driving a major impact at scale today as Snapchatters use our services to shop, play, learn, explore and entertain themselves. This quarter, we announced several new valuable partnerships, innovative AR experiences and new AR features and capabilities in Lens Studio. Over 250 million people engage with augmented reality on Snapchat every day. Accelerating our lead in augmented reality helps us build a durable competitive advantage that comes from investing over the long term, building sophisticated technical tools and capabilities and growing a platform that is increasingly differentiated and difficult to replicate. This momentum and the creative energy of the Snapchat community makes us incredibly excited about the future of augmented reality. As part of our reprioritization efforts, we have reorganized our team to better meet the challenges of the current environment and to make as much progress as possible as quickly as possible in the areas of our business that we are able to control. In particular, there is a significant opportunity to improve coordination and prioritization across our engineering, sales and product teams. In an effort to realize this opportunity, we promoted Jerry Hunter to Chief Operating Officer. Jerry leads our monetization efforts across our three operating regions, EMEA, APAC and Americas as well as our engineering, growth, partnerships and content, AR enterprise and SMB teams. Jerry has repeatedly demonstrated operational rigor at scale, leading our business through several challenging transitions, including the build-out of our advertising platform, the rebuild of our Android product, our infrastructure optimizations and most recently, significant investments in our platform integrity team. With that, I'm excited to introduce Jerry. Thanks, Eric. Yes. So at a high level, we're focused on building our business for the long term. And that means that we really put our community at the center of everything that we do, and we innovate to offer products that add value to people's lives by empowering them to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world and have fun together. And that long-term perspective is really what informs our strategy as we think about navigating this difficult macro environment that has impacted our advertising business over the past few quarters. So, we made the decision to reprioritize and focus our investments on our three strategic priorities: growing our community and their engagement; reaccelerating and diversifying our revenue; and investing in augmented reality. And these changes should allow us to drive continued growth in our community while delivering free cash flow even with low levels of revenue growth. And that gives us a lot more flexibility to focus on the long term in an environment where the cost of capital has increased quite dramatically. There's a lot of opportunity to generate incremental revenue across our platform, whether that's our AR platform, Spotlight or the Map. We've also been growing our Snapchat+ subscription service, which is another way that we deliver value to our community and allows us to monetize the high levels of engagement that we have across our service. Operationally, our advertising business has become a lot more technically complex over the past few years as advertisers are working to better measure and optimize their campaigns. That means that we need to drive increased coordination across our sales, engineering and product teams, which is one of the reasons I'm so excited to have Jerry leading these teams as our COO. I've already observed a significant change in the way that our teams are working together, and I'm really pleased to see the focus on our advertising customers driving everything that they do. I mean, tactically, really, that means working to make conversions on our platform more observable and easier to measure, whether that's more on platform or click-through conversions, improvements to our first-party tooling, third-party tooling and partnerships, ad format improvements, ML and optimization improvements, and of course, continuing to grow our inventory. We saw about an 8% increase in impressions year-over-year in the quarter, which is really a function of daily active users and engagements. And then, as we're looking to the future, we've really tried to make sure that all of our investments are lined up against those three strategic priorities that I mentioned, community growth, revenue growth and AR. And that's really how we're going to be working through this challenging environment. Yes, I can speak a little bit to the content trends that we're seeing in the U.S. and more broadly. So, at a very high level, both in the U.S. and globally, viewership is up. And so that means that our overall opportunity is expanding if we can continue to increase folks' depth of engagement. And that's really important, of course, for advertisers who really value the reach that we provide. Looking more specifically at Stories, what we're finding is that while people continue to engage at really high levels with Stories from their close friends or private stories, especially from people that are really important to them, that depth of story engagement you get to your 200th friend or something like that, at some point, content on Spotlight or Discover is maybe more engaging or more interesting. And so, what we're trying to do is help people transition from that friend story content that really drives that healthy top of funnel and funnel and viewership to content in Spotlight and Discover. And both of those are growing nicely. Spotlight, of course, is growing very rapidly year-over-year and we're excited about that. I think as it pertains to advertisers, as I mentioned, they're really looking for reach but they're also looking for performance, especially in this period of time, which is why we focus so heavily on evolving our direct response business and making sure that we're really delivering return on ad spend for our partners. I think there are going to be some unique opportunities with things like Spotlight, for example, where smaller advertisers can experiment with content, submitting content to Spotlight, seeing how it performs. And then, if they get some traction there and get feedback from our community, they may want to turn into a direct response advertising unit and manage that through our ad platform. So I do think some of the content investments we're making provide new and unique opportunities for advertisers, but really, especially in this environment, the focus is going to be on reach and performance. Thanks, Rich. Yes. So, at a high level, as you pointed out, Snapchat provides an extremely valuable utility in terms of visual messaging but also across our service with things like the Map or our AR platform, and of course, content, as you also mentioned. And so, we've really worked hard to diversify engagement across our products. And our application opens to the camera, so we've got a real strength in visual communication and augmented reality that remains undermonetized, which is why we've really focused on accelerating our revenue growth in augmented reality so that it's more commensurate with the engagement that we're seeing there. And we believe that the differentiated nature of our service is what's contributing to the daily active user growth which grew 19% year-over-year to 363 million daily active users. In terms of the content specifically, I think there's a lot of headroom, of course, to continue to grow content engagement. As I mentioned, viewership has expanded, and we're continuing to see a lot of demand for content and Spotlight, which is growing nicely and on our Discover platform. I think we can do a better job helping people transition from friend stories or private stories into those types of content. And relative to other services where people are spending a lot of time watching content, we believe we have a lot of headroom to increase content engagement, so working to improve content diversity and personalization to realize that opportunity. Overall, of course, impressions grew 8% year-over-year. So, we are seeing some progress there. Thanks, Mark. Yes, so that was an internal memo that we weren't intending to share publicly, and as such, had a number of aspirational goals really designed to rally the team, especially at a time when we're restructuring and refocusing our business, it's really important for our team to see the enormous opportunity that we have in front of us, whether that's reaccelerating our revenue growth by improving our direct response business, better monetizing the enormous amount of AR engagement that we see, obviously, in our camera, and continuing to grow and build on Snapchat+. So, we certainly see a lot of opportunity there, and the goal is really, as we look to 2023, inspiring our team. I remember some really challenging times in the past when expectations were really, really low. And internally, we tried to really inspire our team and that's what helped us deliver a 50% year-over-year revenue growth on average the last five years or so. So, I think especially in really challenging times, when we've taken the necessary steps to make sure our business can be successful over the long term, inspiring the team is critically important. But those goals are internal and aspirational. Hey. Thanks, Brent, for the question. Yes. I mean, these sorts of changes in restructurings are always challenging. And I'm really just grateful to the team and really proud of how quickly they've worked to adapt and really make sure we're focused on our key priorities. I think it's going to take a little bit of time. We certainly have regained some momentum and focus, but the process is still concluding in certain countries where regulations require that those processes take a little bit longer. So, I wouldn't say that we're complete there. I think one thing I'm watching specifically is on the sales side. We've got these president roles. Ronan Harris is joining a bit later this month as our President of EMEA. We will also have an APAC President and an Americas President, and we'll be putting folks into those roles as soon as we can. And in addition to that, we're also thinking about how to better organize our sales teams to go to market in a way that best serves our customers. And we're sort of thinking about Q1 as the time line for that. So, we're certainly not done with this process because we see more opportunity to streamline and improve the way we serve our advertising partners. I know that's something Jerry is thinking a lot about. But overall, if you just look at how the team has managed through this period of time, I'm really proud of the work they're doing and the progress we're making."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Snap Inc.'s Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to David Ometer, Head of Investor Relations.\nDavid Ometer: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Snap's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Evan Spiegel, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder; Jeremi Gorman, Chief Business Officer; and Derek Andersen, Chief Financial Officer. Today, we published our inaugural investor letter on our Investor Relations website and with the SEC shortly after market close. The investor letter includes full details of our results, and we hope that you had a chance to read it. Please also refer to our Investor Relations website at investor.snap.com to find today's press release, slides and our updated investor presentation. This conference call includes forward-looking statements, which are based on our assumptions as of today. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements, and we make no obligation to update our disclosures. For more information about factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to the press release we issued today as well as the risks described in our most recent Form 10-Q, particularly in the section titled Risk Factors. Today's call will include both GAAP and non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations between the 2 can be found in today's press release. Please note that when we discuss all of our expense figures, they will exclude stock-based compensation and related payroll taxes as well as depreciation and amortization and nonrecurring charges. Please refer to our filings with the SEC to understand how we calculate any of the metrics discussed on today's call. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator, who will begin our analyst Q&A session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.\nRoss Sandler: Great. Maybe we could start with the macro environment. You stated in the letter that 3Q is roughly flattish thus far. And that's a pretty material slowdown from where you guys were 90 days ago, which, I guess, isn't surprising given kind of what's going on with the macro. So could you parse out for us which categories are slowing the most in your ad business? And you called out in the letter some high-growth sectors cutting back. I'd assume you mean venture-backed, start-up-type companies that buy ads on Snap. How big of a revenue bucket is that for you guys? And how does the trajectory there compare to the larger kind of Fortune 500 marketers on your platform?\nDerek Andersen: Ross, it's Derek speaking, and thanks for the question. I think it's probably a good opportunity to step back and discuss how the overall demand environment is materializing. As you noted, we have seen a pretty good deceleration over the last 90 days. And as we noted in the shareholder letter, we've seen that across our DR and brand businesses as well as a number of sectors.  But over a longer trajectory here, we've observed a fairly steady deceleration in demand over the last year. The deceleration began with the platform policy changes implemented in Q3 of last year. Those policy changes upended a decade of advertising industry standards, and in turn, the model is used to drive the direct response to advertising business as well as the tools used to measure the returns from that direct response advertising.  And then beginning -- later in Q4 and certainly through the first half of this year, we've seen macroeconomic challenges have built. While there have been lingering supply chain and labor supply issues impacting certain segments that began during the pandemic, more recently, we've seen the impact of persistently high inflation, then rising interest rates and rising geopolitical risks associated with the war in Ukraine. Those macro headwinds have disrupted many of the industry segments that have been most critical to the growing demand for advertising solutions over prior years. We're seeing these various headwinds put pressure on the earnings of a wide variety of companies, and this is directly impacting the demand for advertising. Specifically, advertising spending, in particular, auction-driven direct response advertising is among the very few line items in a company's cost structure that they can reduce immediately in response to pressure on their top line or their input costs. As a result, as many industries and verticals have come under top line or input cost pressure, advertising spending has been amongst the first areas impacted. And to put a finer point on that, we've, over time, worked very hard to make it very easy for our clients to turn on advertising and to ramp their advertising. And that's been particularly good for our business as budgets have grown over time. But in a period where we're seeing headwinds, it's also very easy to turn off and very quick to turn off. So we see this dynamic within our business as advertisers have lowered their budgets and their bids per action to reflect their current willingness to pay. So for example, in some industries where top line growth may remain strong but the businesses are experiencing input cost pressure due to inflation, we've observed reduced marketing spending and lower bids per action. And in certain other high-growth sectors where businesses are seeing higher cost of capital, that's further reflected in their campaign budgets and their level of bids per action. So amid these various headwinds, we're also seeing increasing competition because the advertising dollars in aggregate are now growing more slowly, and that intensifies the competition we see.  So because of these impacts from the platform policy changes and the macro environment and the competition all compound on one another, it can be difficult to sort of attribute the deceleration to any one factor. But in order to keep growing, we've got to stay focused on the inputs that we control. And that means investing to improve our direct response business including our first and third-party measurement solutions as well as improve ranking and optimization. So hopefully, that gives you a little broader context of how we're seeing the demand environment evolve and how that's translating into our business more recently.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: I have two. The first one, I appreciate the color around where we are sort of to start out 3Q being flattish. I know there's a lot of moving pieces on here, Derek, on the months and things. Just remind us how we should think about the monthly comps, July versus August versus September, and some of the platform changes impacting the year-on-year comp structure throughout this quarter. And then the second one, I think the last answer was pretty helpful. But just walk us through philosophically in this type of macro environment, what do you have to execute on to really get the business back to growth? Do you have to add more advertisers? How do you get advertisers to expand, ad budget? Like what are sort of your key strategies you need to execute on to sort of get back to healthy growth in the next 6 months through the platform?\nDerek Andersen: Thanks for the question. I'll take both of those. First, as we enter Q3, a lot of the headwinds that I just talked about in the prior question continue to be as significant as they've been at any point recently. And it's not clear how those headwinds are going to evolve as we go through the quarter, whether they might abate or whether they may intensify. And one of the reasons for that is the point I mentioned near the end there, which is, in particular, how easy it is to ramp up spending on our platform and how flexible we've made it for folks to ramp down their spending. And so the reaction within our business and our top line to a shift in those trends can be fairly rapid, and that makes the visibility forward-looking particularly challenging. So given that, we believe the most prudent approach to giving folks some indication of what to expect going forward is to focus on providing transparency on how our business is performing right now and our plans to better position our business for long-term growth.  So that sort of leads into your second question. And essentially to return to a higher rate of long-term revenue growth, we're focused on 3 priorities. The first is investing in our products and our platforms to sustain the growth of our community, which has been very healthy. The second is investing heavily in our direct response advertising business, and we've articulated 3 key priorities there, including around investing in our first- and third-party measurement solutions as well as continuing to make improvements in our optimization and ranking and product innovation. And then lastly, as we shared a little bit in the letter, we're focused on cultivating new sources of revenue that will help diversify our top line revenue over time. So we believe that if we can stay committed and focused on these priorities and combine that with our unique reach and rapid product innovation that we've demonstrated over a long period of time here, that provides us a path to regain momentum over time. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of helpful additional context on your questions. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Rich Greenfield with LightShed Partners.\nRichard Greenfield: I'm going to struggle to keep it to one. But on Page 1, you called out growing competition for ad dollars on top of the slowing ad market. I'm curious, how much of that is sort of directly tied to TikTok, which has been a monster in terms of its growth, versus sort of the 2 juggernauts that exist today in terms of Google and Facebook? Any color on sort of where that competition is coming from? And then I guess sort of related to this on time spent. Is any of this people spending less time, and it obviously relates to competition, but is this people spending less time on Snapchat every day, meaning less opportunities to monetize the user? Or is this just purely advertisers simply not spending as much as they were before? I'd be curious on both of those points.\nDerek Andersen: Rich, it's Derek. I'll take the question. So on the competition side in terms of monetization, we face a number of very large and very sophisticated competitors. So today, we're seeing the overall advertising pie grow at a slower rate amid the macro headwinds I've mentioned earlier. So as competition, whether it's with TikTok or any of the other very large, sophisticated players in this space, has only intensified. So it's hard to disentangle the numerous factors here impacting what's clearly a headwind driving deceleration in our business. But definitely, as you see that high grow at a slower rate and you've got lots of folks competing very intensely over it, you're going to see the competitive factor be a bigger part of the overall discussion. And then in terms of what we're seeing on engagement and how that's translating to revenue, one, you're correct that the community in aggregate continues to grow at a healthy rate. And we've also seen time spent with content where we generate the majority of our revenue today growing, and that's reflected in the approximately 9% impression growth that we shared in the letter.  The primary issue here is about how demand is materializing. And so we talked a little extensively about this already, but we've definitely seen the deceleration in demand as we've -- first, with the platform changes, then all of the macro issues that have compounded on top of that, which are really a significant factor at this point, and then the competition play into it.  So I think from a perspective of seeing the growth materialize, this is really about the demand side of things. What we have to do is stay focused on the inputs that we control, and that's around investing in our direct response business and making sure that we get improvements into our first- and third-party measurement solutions as well as continuing to invest in improving optimization and ranking and personalization. And so certainly, the continued growth of our community is going to help over the long term and is very important to the long-term health of the business. But in the near term, this is about demand and us improving our direct response to advertising tools to serve that demand for the long term. So hopefully, that provides a little helpful context to those questions.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.\nEric Sheridan: Maybe I'll ask this as a 2-parter. As you look back over the last 2 years from when Apple first announced their policy changes and then implemented them a year ago, maybe talk a little bit about what your key learnings have been that you wish you had maybe done on a more accelerated timetable or how you might have positioned the company differently looking backwards over the last 2 years. And putting a finer point on the 3 elements of how to build and scale the DR business from here, can you put some sense around how far along you are on those initiatives and the amount of investment capacity that might be needed to achieve them and/or a timetable in which to achieve them?\nJeremi Gorman: Yes. Sure. Thanks for the question. This is Jeremi talking. So I think when you want to talk about the long term, I want to go back to what Derek was mentioning regarding our key priorities and where we're focused on growing the business. So in particular, focusing on our measurement strategies as well as integrating with both third-party and first-party measurement solutions to get everything back on track. When you think of our advertising set more broadly, there are a litany of ways that they measure their advertising, including their own proprietary tools and then, of course, our first-party, privacy-centric tools but then the third-party tools that they prefer. So continuing to optimize there and then continuing to drive demand in categories where we have headwinds, I think, are particularly important in that regard.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with UBS.\nLloyd Walmsley: If I can ask two. I guess the first one would just be as we think about the divergence in tone between the major ad agency holdcos that continue to sound relatively upbeat versus what you guys are seeing, do you think that that's just a function of them being a lagging indicator? Is it a different customer base? Is digital brand just easier to cut faster? Like what do you think are some of the divergences you're seeing there? And are there customers still spending at healthy rates with you guys or maybe just moving budget? And then the second one would just be as we think about moving through whatever form of downturn this is coming out on the other side, do you think that the 50% top line growth ambition is still attainable in this kind of environment of increased competition and diluted ad performance post ATT? Is it just going to be a tougher road structurally? Or do you think 50% is still on the table on the other side of this trough here?\nJeremi Gorman: This is Jeremi again. I will take the first part and then hand it over to Derek. We saw a lot of enthusiasm at Cannes as well and a lot of really great reaction to our incredible augmented reality exhibit that we had there. But in general, I'm kind of harkening back to what Derek just said earlier in the call, is that over the past few years, we've spent a lot of time removing friction from buying and selling on our platform.  You alluded to this in your question in terms of it making -- when it turns -- it's easier to turn on. It's definitely easier to turn off. So as companies are reevaluating their priorities and their cost structure, they are looking at things like digital ad spend. It's easy to pause, reevaluate and move forward there. So those same tools and services that make it easy to ramp up, make it easy to ramp down. And we know that our advertising partners are facing significant uncertainty, and we talked about that a few times. So I'll focus on the others. You mentioned this as well, but there is a pretty heavy selection bias for the kinds of team members and the types of clients that attend Cannes. We talk a lot about a balance between our DR business as well as our brand business. Large agencies as well as brands tend to be heavily represented at Cannes, whereas other companies like direct-to-consumer, e-commerce, for instance, or app install are less represented at Cannes.  So I think that's part of the divergence that you're seeing, is, to your point, about them being kind of just a different mix of people that's less representative. And a lot of those brands that are bearing the brunt of these macro issues that we've talked about before, they aren't particularly well represented at Cannes. So I think that's what you're seeing there. But again, I think that one of the things that was really exciting for us and me personally being there was the excitement around the augmented reality advertising future. We had an exhibit with a lot of incredible brands there. And we're able to showcase our capabilities and believe that, that will have a long-term halo effect on the AR business, where we remain incredibly committed in addition to our resilient performance business.\nDerek Andersen: And it's Derek. I can take the second part of that, which is with the long-term growth prospects. I think first, it's important to step back, and I think it's probably clear for all. But in order to achieve really elevated growth rates, we're going to need an operating environment that is more cooperative than the one that we're experiencing right now. Having stable platform policies that we can build and optimize against are really important, but having a macro environment where clients are able to invest and grow their marketing budgets is really important, too. It's definitely easier to grow our top line in an environment where there are incremental budgets being deployed and we can capture incremental share versus simply having to take share of the existing pie in order to grow. The key here is being focused on the inputs that we control and the things that are critical to long-term growth. We've articulated some of those in our letter. So to be super clear, one is continuing the growth of our global community at a rapid pace. We already reached a very deep penetration in many of the world's most attractive advertising markets, but continuing to deepen our engagement and our penetration of those advertising markets and the overall global community is input one. And the second is, as we've discussed earlier here today, is continuing to invest in our direct response business and improving that consistently over time. Number one, we're improving our first- and third-party measurement solutions; and two, through better ranking and optimization that delivers better optimization for our advertising partners and therefore return on ad spend over time; and then three is really about continuing to cultivate new sources of revenue across our business, and there's lots of opportunity for that.  Obviously, we have a number of screens in our application that are currently undermonetized that present a lot of opportunity to grow over time, whether that's Spotlight or the Camera that's very early in its monetization, or over the longer term, the Map and, of course, the future of AR and many other formats. And of course, we've got other endeavors that are earlier and are going that could provide growth, including the recently launched Snapchat+. So continuing to invest in diversifying our top line growth to drive resiliency into our business and being well positioned for the long term is the key. And if we stay focused on those priorities, we believe we'll be well positioned over time.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.\nJustin Post: Great. You've talked a lot about measurement in both the letter and on the comments here. I guess the first question is, did measurement deteriorate in the quarter? Any changes from Apple or Google, either in the quarter or looking forward to the second half? And then second, when you look at the measurement opportunity, how would you say you do versus peers today? And what is the timing for starting to see real improvement there?\nJeremi Gorman: Yes, no problem. This is Jeremi. So we'll talk about the measurement tools here, particularly as it pertains to the peers. Thank you for the question. So there are a couple of things to keep in mind, that measurement, targeting, optimization and engagement all together are important for driving performance. And measurable performance in particular is what we have always been focused on.  We still see a lot of headroom in improving our optimization and engagement, and we talked about that, and Derek just covered it as one of our core priorities. But I can give you an answer specifically to measurement in particular, which we have called out for a while, and this is where we're focused on our 2 key priorities. So as we talked about kind of over the last year as platform changes have happened, driving adoption, utilization and trust in our first-party privacy-preserving measurement solutions such as estimated conversions, for example, is a key part of this journey. So near term, our focus is growing -- on growing the adoption of those privacy performing integration technologies, and those help feed both measurement and optimization such as the conversions API that we've had for quite some time.  And then from there, we have to focus on building trust in those estimated conversions. As I mentioned in one of my earlier example -- in one of my earlier answers, advertisers are playing around with new measurement as well, triangulating on first-party, third-party and proprietary solutions. These statistically modeled conversions -- when we're building trust, these statistically modeled conversions can augment some of those third-party tools. An example of that would be Scan in a privacy-preserving manner and giving advertisers more information to act quickly. But in general, we believe that estimated conversions are going to become an increasingly important part of a privacy-centric advertising world, which feeds into the second measurement priority that we have, which is ensuring that our advertising performance is well represented in advertisers' preferred third-party measurement solutions. So that -- what I mean by that is that this is a core component of building trust.  So regardless of the impact of our advertising, if our first-party measurement tools are not in alignment with advertisers' preferred, trusted third-party tools, we're still fighting an uphill battle. And those third-party tools across both web and app have been impacted by platform policy changes. This has been particularly acute for web-based advertisers and has led to an increase in a relative emphasis on same session, last click-based advertising, where we need to show that we are performant. We're still early in this journey. The platform policy changes, as you know, are an ever-evolving environment, but we do feel confident in our solutions and the opportunity ahead of us. We're going to focus on this problem holistically, and we believe that we're going to improve performance in parallel with how we're represented within third-party tools than we get credit for the conversions that we do drive. In turn, that will drive trust in our first-party solutions, which will then enable us to focus on optimizing towards these privacy-based observable actions, and that will drive our advertising flywheel.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brent Thill with Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: Derek, can you talk to the trade-off to profitability? And what are the steps you're taking, as you highlight in the letter, to emerge as a more focused company?\nDerek Andersen: Brent, thanks for the question. First, I think it's clear, our rate of revenue growth has slowed considerably, and we are acknowledging we must adapt our investment strategy accordingly. So first, we intend to substantially slow our rate of hiring to effectively pause growth in our headcount, which is a significant portion of our OpEx. In addition, we'll be looking at the rate of operating expense growth that is nonpersonnel-related in order to stem the rate of growth in our overall operating expenses, the objective there being to get to a place where we can carve out a path to free cash flow breakeven or better even at reduced rates of top line growth. As we implement these changes, we'll be reprioritizing our investments and driving renewed focus on productivity in particular. And in addition, we'll focus our go-forward investments around sustaining the investments we believe are most critical to capitalizing on the future of AR and executing on the priorities we articulated in the letter and that I've shared here today. We may incur some transition costs along the way as we execute on these changes, but we expect to emerge from all of that with a more focused cost structure as a result. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of how we're thinking about it in terms of both a priority perspective and how to bring the growth both in our OpEx and overall cost structure under control. Thanks for the question. I hope that provides some additional insight.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore.\nMark Mahaney: When you talk about diversifying your revenue streams, I think, Derek, you mentioned a couple of different areas, Maps, Spotlight, et cetera. Could you triage those a little bit? Of those different areas, which do you think has got the greatest potential to the least potential in terms of diversification?  And then I want to get back to one macro question. In the script here, you talked about macroeconomic challenges that have disrupted many of the industries that have been most critical to your advertising solutions. Is there a particular reason why the macro pressures would have impacted your advertiser base more than what would happen with other companies? Is there something about your advertiser base that may be more economically sensitive than what we would see in the general economy?\nDerek Andersen: Mark, it's Derek speaking. Thanks for the questions, and I'll get in there on those. I think in terms of -- taking them in reverse order, your second question there around our composition of advertising and why it might be more and less challenging for us. I think, first of all, it's difficult to know what the composition of other folks' businesses are. Certainly, we have a relatively lower exposure to small- and medium-sized, brick-and-mortar businesses. So that's part of the substance there. But I think more than anything, when you're thinking about us decelerating from what was a very rapid rate of growth to nearly flat or approximately flat growth currently, one of the challenges, I think, that is clearly difficult is that it's much easier to gain share when budgets are growing and when investment levels are growing. And so it's easier to take share, whereas as we're seeing the overall advertising pie grow at a smaller rate, then that essentially intensifies the competition over that bid. And then the last thing that I would share just here in terms of the composition of revenue is that obviously, we've shared previously that the significant majority of our revenue is direct response related. And as I've mentioned earlier, one of the things we've tried very hard to do on behalf of our advertising partners in recent years is to make it very easy to turn on and off direct response advertising and to scale that advertising very quickly.  And so as our partners were able to grow their marketing budgets and grow their rates of investment, they were able to very easily and with very high return on investment scale their advertising with us. But that works in the opposite way when folks have to retrench their budgets, and it's very easy to shrink down. And so to the extent that we maybe skew in those 2 ways differently than other folks, that might impact relative growth rates. And then over the long term, the question on where we see opportunity, one, I think we've got a significant amount of green space on the application. We've talked about that over recent years. One, we still obviously have room to go on our content business that we monetize today, but Spotlight is a relatively new product for us. We shared last quarter that we have begun testing monetization there. Certainly, we're excited about that opportunity over the long term and expect that we'll expand the testing there into the back half of the year, especially later in the year when that sort of inventory will be more helpful.  Obviously, the longest -- long term, the most exciting opportunity is AR. And we're investing heavily around the future of AR to drive monetization and enterprise solutions for our AR partners, and we're very excited about that opportunity to contribute to the business over the long term.  And of course, medium to long term is the Map, and we're very excited about what we're seeing there on engagement. We shared some stats in the letter and some of the engagement that we're driving around Map. And so those are all exciting avenues to expand monetization across our ad business. And then if you look further into other diversification opportunities that we've been discussing more recently, including the launch of Snapchat+, obviously, a lot of opportunities here. Staying focused on our core priorities is going to be the key in order to execute on that. So we're seeing long-term growth. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of context to how we're thinking about it over the longer term.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Mark Shmulik with Bernstein.\nMark Shmulik: Derek, I know you mentioned a few times, I think, the ability for Snap to grow as ad budgets grow. And I guess what I'm wondering is in conversations with some of your core advertisers, how much of the impact that they're seeing to their ad budgets would you say are transitory versus a real permanent rebasing in how they think about performance marketing and digital advertising spend?\nJeremi Gorman: Thanks for the question. This is Jeremi. I can take this one. I think we're looking at macro pressures from a litany of different angles. We're hearing supply chain pressure, inflationary costs, of course, that are impacting unit economics as it pertains to moving product. They're getting pressure from the cost of capital, as we've talked about before, capital being more expensive as well as drying up in different areas.  So insofar as any of those are transitory, I think that's yet to play out in the overall macro. But what we're hearing from advertisers, I think, more specifically as it pertains to advertising budgets is what we said before, which is that they are taking this time, given all of those other macro pressures, to reevaluate their priorities to ensure that they're making the right investments in the right places. And when we talk about digital advertising, it is the easiest thing to turn off.  I know we said that a couple of different times, but I think it's important to reiterate here, is that it is the most important thing to turn off. But it is also one of the most performant tools in their tool chest. So as things start to rebound for some of these advertisers in the areas where the macro pressures are a little bit more transitory, it's also the first thing to get turned back on. So we remain optimistic that as things hopefully start to improve in the macro that we can capture that opportunity by remaining focused on the 3 key priorities that we've articulated in the call earlier.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\nDouglas Anmuth: Just when you think about the new sources of revenue, you talked about some of the new surfaces, including Spotlight and Camera and perhaps Map further out. How do you think about balancing opening up more inventory there with what's essentially more of a demand problem near term? And then on a related question, can you just talk about Spotlight engagement and the extent to which you think it's incremental versus a shift for users within the platform?\nDerek Andersen: Doug, it's Derek speaking. I can take the first one there. Just in terms of -- from a very short-term perspective, I would say that the primary issue, as you've alluded, is about demand generation. So in the near term, we're very focused on demand generation. I think that opening up new sources of inventory and new sources of supply over time are really critical to the long-term growth and the long-term health of the business, which is why we're focused on continuing to invest in the growth of the community and continuing to invest in our content businesses and the Map and, of course, our AR capabilities so that we can generate more effective inventory over time. And of course, as we're thinking about ramping testing of the monetization of Spotlight, of course, we think about the course of the year and where demand generation peaks over the course of the year. And so in the very near term, I think you're right that predominantly, this is about demand. The extent to which incremental supply is going to be helpful is really over the medium and long term. And so fortunately, the healthy growth in the community and the healthy engagement we're seeing across our platform is really helpful to driving that long-term opportunity. And then in terms of Spotlight versus -- incremental versus within the platform, when we look at content engagement, we're very focused on continuing to see people engaging with Stories from their friends and family. That's one of the things that bring them into Discover and then helping them segue into additional entertaining content from Discover or Spotlight. We've been pleased to see the overall time spent watching content grew globally year-over-year. And of course, Spotlight, itself, also doing very well, growing 59% year-over-year on time and MAU growing 46% year-over-year to reach more than 270 million.  So certainly being able to grow the overall content engagement and then being able to grow Spotlight at accelerated rates is encouraging for the overall engagement piece. At the same time, we're still seeing Discover do very well, including generating very wide viewership growth on users over the age of 25, which is exciting for growing and aging up with our communities.  So overall, as we step back and look at the service, we're particularly excited about the growth in our overall community. That's the key input to then driving people into each of our products, and having DAU up 18% year-over-year or 54 million is a great sign of health in the overall community, and the working people into our products from there is the key. So hopefully, that gives a little bit more context. And thank you very much for the question.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session as well as Snap Inc.'s Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Derek Andersen",
            "content": "Ross, it's Derek speaking, and thanks for the question. I think it's probably a good opportunity to step back and discuss how the overall demand environment is materializing. As you noted, we have seen a pretty good deceleration over the last 90 days. And as we noted in the shareholder letter, we've seen that across our DR and brand businesses as well as a number of sectors.  But over a longer trajectory here, we've observed a fairly steady deceleration in demand over the last year. The deceleration began with the platform policy changes implemented in Q3 of last year. Those policy changes upended a decade of advertising industry standards, and in turn, the model is used to drive the direct response to advertising business as well as the tools used to measure the returns from that direct response advertising.  And then beginning -- later in Q4 and certainly through the first half of this year, we've seen macroeconomic challenges have built. While there have been lingering supply chain and labor supply issues impacting certain segments that began during the pandemic, more recently, we've seen the impact of persistently high inflation, then rising interest rates and rising geopolitical risks associated with the war in Ukraine. Those macro headwinds have disrupted many of the industry segments that have been most critical to the growing demand for advertising solutions over prior years. We're seeing these various headwinds put pressure on the earnings of a wide variety of companies, and this is directly impacting the demand for advertising. Specifically, advertising spending, in particular, auction-driven direct response advertising is among the very few line items in a company's cost structure that they can reduce immediately in response to pressure on their top line or their input costs. As a result, as many industries and verticals have come under top line or input cost pressure, advertising spending has been amongst the first areas impacted. And to put a finer point on that, we've, over time, worked very hard to make it very easy for our clients to turn on advertising and to ramp their advertising. And that's been particularly good for our business as budgets have grown over time. But in a period where we're seeing headwinds, it's also very easy to turn off and very quick to turn off. So we see this dynamic within our business as advertisers have lowered their budgets and their bids per action to reflect their current willingness to pay. So for example, in some industries where top line growth may remain strong but the businesses are experiencing input cost pressure due to inflation, we've observed reduced marketing spending and lower bids per action. And in certain other high-growth sectors where businesses are seeing higher cost of capital, that's further reflected in their campaign budgets and their level of bids per action. So amid these various headwinds, we're also seeing increasing competition because the advertising dollars in aggregate are now growing more slowly, and that intensifies the competition we see.  So because of these impacts from the platform policy changes and the macro environment and the competition all compound on one another, it can be difficult to sort of attribute the deceleration to any one factor. But in order to keep growing, we've got to stay focused on the inputs that we control. And that means investing to improve our direct response business including our first and third-party measurement solutions as well as improve ranking and optimization. So hopefully, that gives you a little broader context of how we're seeing the demand environment evolve and how that's translating into our business more recently. Thanks for the question. I'll take both of those. First, as we enter Q3, a lot of the headwinds that I just talked about in the prior question continue to be as significant as they've been at any point recently. And it's not clear how those headwinds are going to evolve as we go through the quarter, whether they might abate or whether they may intensify. And one of the reasons for that is the point I mentioned near the end there, which is, in particular, how easy it is to ramp up spending on our platform and how flexible we've made it for folks to ramp down their spending. And so the reaction within our business and our top line to a shift in those trends can be fairly rapid, and that makes the visibility forward-looking particularly challenging. So given that, we believe the most prudent approach to giving folks some indication of what to expect going forward is to focus on providing transparency on how our business is performing right now and our plans to better position our business for long-term growth.  So that sort of leads into your second question. And essentially to return to a higher rate of long-term revenue growth, we're focused on 3 priorities. The first is investing in our products and our platforms to sustain the growth of our community, which has been very healthy. The second is investing heavily in our direct response advertising business, and we've articulated 3 key priorities there, including around investing in our first- and third-party measurement solutions as well as continuing to make improvements in our optimization and ranking and product innovation. And then lastly, as we shared a little bit in the letter, we're focused on cultivating new sources of revenue that will help diversify our top line revenue over time. So we believe that if we can stay committed and focused on these priorities and combine that with our unique reach and rapid product innovation that we've demonstrated over a long period of time here, that provides us a path to regain momentum over time. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of helpful additional context on your questions. Thank you. Rich, it's Derek. I'll take the question. So on the competition side in terms of monetization, we face a number of very large and very sophisticated competitors. So today, we're seeing the overall advertising pie grow at a slower rate amid the macro headwinds I've mentioned earlier. So as competition, whether it's with TikTok or any of the other very large, sophisticated players in this space, has only intensified. So it's hard to disentangle the numerous factors here impacting what's clearly a headwind driving deceleration in our business. But definitely, as you see that high grow at a slower rate and you've got lots of folks competing very intensely over it, you're going to see the competitive factor be a bigger part of the overall discussion. And then in terms of what we're seeing on engagement and how that's translating to revenue, one, you're correct that the community in aggregate continues to grow at a healthy rate. And we've also seen time spent with content where we generate the majority of our revenue today growing, and that's reflected in the approximately 9% impression growth that we shared in the letter.  The primary issue here is about how demand is materializing. And so we talked a little extensively about this already, but we've definitely seen the deceleration in demand as we've -- first, with the platform changes, then all of the macro issues that have compounded on top of that, which are really a significant factor at this point, and then the competition play into it.  So I think from a perspective of seeing the growth materialize, this is really about the demand side of things. What we have to do is stay focused on the inputs that we control, and that's around investing in our direct response business and making sure that we get improvements into our first- and third-party measurement solutions as well as continuing to invest in improving optimization and ranking and personalization. And so certainly, the continued growth of our community is going to help over the long term and is very important to the long-term health of the business. But in the near term, this is about demand and us improving our direct response to advertising tools to serve that demand for the long term. So hopefully, that provides a little helpful context to those questions. And it's Derek. I can take the second part of that, which is with the long-term growth prospects. I think first, it's important to step back, and I think it's probably clear for all. But in order to achieve really elevated growth rates, we're going to need an operating environment that is more cooperative than the one that we're experiencing right now. Having stable platform policies that we can build and optimize against are really important, but having a macro environment where clients are able to invest and grow their marketing budgets is really important, too. It's definitely easier to grow our top line in an environment where there are incremental budgets being deployed and we can capture incremental share versus simply having to take share of the existing pie in order to grow. The key here is being focused on the inputs that we control and the things that are critical to long-term growth. We've articulated some of those in our letter. So to be super clear, one is continuing the growth of our global community at a rapid pace. We already reached a very deep penetration in many of the world's most attractive advertising markets, but continuing to deepen our engagement and our penetration of those advertising markets and the overall global community is input one. And the second is, as we've discussed earlier here today, is continuing to invest in our direct response business and improving that consistently over time. Number one, we're improving our first- and third-party measurement solutions; and two, through better ranking and optimization that delivers better optimization for our advertising partners and therefore return on ad spend over time; and then three is really about continuing to cultivate new sources of revenue across our business, and there's lots of opportunity for that.  Obviously, we have a number of screens in our application that are currently undermonetized that present a lot of opportunity to grow over time, whether that's Spotlight or the Camera that's very early in its monetization, or over the longer term, the Map and, of course, the future of AR and many other formats. And of course, we've got other endeavors that are earlier and are going that could provide growth, including the recently launched Snapchat+. So continuing to invest in diversifying our top line growth to drive resiliency into our business and being well positioned for the long term is the key. And if we stay focused on those priorities, we believe we'll be well positioned over time. Brent, thanks for the question. First, I think it's clear, our rate of revenue growth has slowed considerably, and we are acknowledging we must adapt our investment strategy accordingly. So first, we intend to substantially slow our rate of hiring to effectively pause growth in our headcount, which is a significant portion of our OpEx. In addition, we'll be looking at the rate of operating expense growth that is nonpersonnel-related in order to stem the rate of growth in our overall operating expenses, the objective there being to get to a place where we can carve out a path to free cash flow breakeven or better even at reduced rates of top line growth. As we implement these changes, we'll be reprioritizing our investments and driving renewed focus on productivity in particular. And in addition, we'll focus our go-forward investments around sustaining the investments we believe are most critical to capitalizing on the future of AR and executing on the priorities we articulated in the letter and that I've shared here today. We may incur some transition costs along the way as we execute on these changes, but we expect to emerge from all of that with a more focused cost structure as a result. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of how we're thinking about it in terms of both a priority perspective and how to bring the growth both in our OpEx and overall cost structure under control. Thanks for the question. I hope that provides some additional insight. Mark, it's Derek speaking. Thanks for the questions, and I'll get in there on those. I think in terms of -- taking them in reverse order, your second question there around our composition of advertising and why it might be more and less challenging for us. I think, first of all, it's difficult to know what the composition of other folks' businesses are. Certainly, we have a relatively lower exposure to small- and medium-sized, brick-and-mortar businesses. So that's part of the substance there. But I think more than anything, when you're thinking about us decelerating from what was a very rapid rate of growth to nearly flat or approximately flat growth currently, one of the challenges, I think, that is clearly difficult is that it's much easier to gain share when budgets are growing and when investment levels are growing. And so it's easier to take share, whereas as we're seeing the overall advertising pie grow at a smaller rate, then that essentially intensifies the competition over that bid. And then the last thing that I would share just here in terms of the composition of revenue is that obviously, we've shared previously that the significant majority of our revenue is direct response related. And as I've mentioned earlier, one of the things we've tried very hard to do on behalf of our advertising partners in recent years is to make it very easy to turn on and off direct response advertising and to scale that advertising very quickly.  And so as our partners were able to grow their marketing budgets and grow their rates of investment, they were able to very easily and with very high return on investment scale their advertising with us. But that works in the opposite way when folks have to retrench their budgets, and it's very easy to shrink down. And so to the extent that we maybe skew in those 2 ways differently than other folks, that might impact relative growth rates. And then over the long term, the question on where we see opportunity, one, I think we've got a significant amount of green space on the application. We've talked about that over recent years. One, we still obviously have room to go on our content business that we monetize today, but Spotlight is a relatively new product for us. We shared last quarter that we have begun testing monetization there. Certainly, we're excited about that opportunity over the long term and expect that we'll expand the testing there into the back half of the year, especially later in the year when that sort of inventory will be more helpful.  Obviously, the longest -- long term, the most exciting opportunity is AR. And we're investing heavily around the future of AR to drive monetization and enterprise solutions for our AR partners, and we're very excited about that opportunity to contribute to the business over the long term.  And of course, medium to long term is the Map, and we're very excited about what we're seeing there on engagement. We shared some stats in the letter and some of the engagement that we're driving around Map. And so those are all exciting avenues to expand monetization across our ad business. And then if you look further into other diversification opportunities that we've been discussing more recently, including the launch of Snapchat+, obviously, a lot of opportunities here. Staying focused on our core priorities is going to be the key in order to execute on that. So we're seeing long-term growth. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of context to how we're thinking about it over the longer term. Doug, it's Derek speaking. I can take the first one there. Just in terms of -- from a very short-term perspective, I would say that the primary issue, as you've alluded, is about demand generation. So in the near term, we're very focused on demand generation. I think that opening up new sources of inventory and new sources of supply over time are really critical to the long-term growth and the long-term health of the business, which is why we're focused on continuing to invest in the growth of the community and continuing to invest in our content businesses and the Map and, of course, our AR capabilities so that we can generate more effective inventory over time. And of course, as we're thinking about ramping testing of the monetization of Spotlight, of course, we think about the course of the year and where demand generation peaks over the course of the year. And so in the very near term, I think you're right that predominantly, this is about demand. The extent to which incremental supply is going to be helpful is really over the medium and long term. And so fortunately, the healthy growth in the community and the healthy engagement we're seeing across our platform is really helpful to driving that long-term opportunity. And then in terms of Spotlight versus -- incremental versus within the platform, when we look at content engagement, we're very focused on continuing to see people engaging with Stories from their friends and family. That's one of the things that bring them into Discover and then helping them segue into additional entertaining content from Discover or Spotlight.

So hopefully, that gives a little bit more context. And thank you very much for the question."

            "name": "Jeremi Gorman",
            "content": "Yes. Sure. Thanks for the question. This is Jeremi talking. So I think when you want to talk about the long term, I want to go back to what Derek was mentioning regarding our key priorities and where we're focused on growing the business. So in particular, focusing on our measurement strategies as well as integrating with both third-party and first-party measurement solutions to get everything back on track. When you think of our advertising set more broadly, there are a litany of ways that they measure their advertising, including their own proprietary tools and then, of course, our first-party, privacy-centric tools but then the third-party tools that they prefer. So continuing to optimize there and then continuing to drive demand in categories where we have headwinds, I think, are particularly important in that regard. This is Jeremi again. I will take the first part and then hand it over to Derek. We saw a lot of enthusiasm at Cannes as well and a lot of really great reaction to our incredible augmented reality exhibit that we had there. But in general, I'm kind of harkening back to what Derek just said earlier in the call, is that over the past few years, we've spent a lot of time removing friction from buying and selling on our platform.  You alluded to this in your question in terms of it making -- when it turns -- it's easier to turn on. It's definitely easier to turn off. So as companies are reevaluating their priorities and their cost structure, they are looking at things like digital ad spend. It's easy to pause, reevaluate and move forward there. So those same tools and services that make it easy to ramp up, make it easy to ramp down. And we know that our advertising partners are facing significant uncertainty, and we talked about that a few times. So I'll focus on the others. You mentioned this as well, but there is a pretty heavy selection bias for the kinds of team members and the types of clients that attend Cannes. We talk a lot about a balance between our DR business as well as our brand business. Large agencies as well as brands tend to be heavily represented at Cannes, whereas other companies like direct-to-consumer, e-commerce, for instance, or app install are less represented at Cannes.  So I think that's part of the divergence that you're seeing, is, to your point, about them being kind of just a different mix of people that's less representative. And a lot of those brands that are bearing the brunt of these macro issues that we've talked about before, they aren't particularly well represented at Cannes. So I think that's what you're seeing there. But again, I think that one of the things that was really exciting for us and me personally being there was the excitement around the augmented reality advertising future. We had an exhibit with a lot of incredible brands there. And we're able to showcase our capabilities and believe that, that will have a long-term halo effect on the AR business, where we remain incredibly committed in addition to our resilient performance business. Yes, no problem. This is Jeremi. So we'll talk about the measurement tools here, particularly as it pertains to the peers. Thank you for the question. So there are a couple of things to keep in mind, that measurement, targeting, optimization and engagement all together are important for driving performance. And measurable performance in particular is what we have always been focused on.  We still see a lot of headroom in improving our optimization and engagement, and we talked about that, and Derek just covered it as one of our core priorities. But I can give you an answer specifically to measurement in particular, which we have called out for a while, and this is where we're focused on our 2 key priorities. So as we talked about kind of over the last year as platform changes have happened, driving adoption, utilization and trust in our first-party privacy-preserving measurement solutions such as estimated conversions, for example, is a key part of this journey. So near term, our focus is growing -- on growing the adoption of those privacy performing integration technologies, and those help feed both measurement and optimization such as the conversions API that we've had for quite some time.  And then from there, we have to focus on building trust in those estimated conversions. As I mentioned in one of my earlier example -- in one of my earlier answers, advertisers are playing around with new measurement as well, triangulating on first-party, third-party and proprietary solutions. These statistically modeled conversions -- when we're building trust, these statistically modeled conversions can augment some of those third-party tools. An example of that would be Scan in a privacy-preserving manner and giving advertisers more information to act quickly. But in general, we believe that estimated conversions are going to become an increasingly important part of a privacy-centric advertising world, which feeds into the second measurement priority that we have, which is ensuring that our advertising performance is well represented in advertisers' preferred third-party measurement solutions. So that -- what I mean by that is that this is a core component of building trust.  So regardless of the impact of our advertising, if our first-party measurement tools are not in alignment with advertisers' preferred, trusted third-party tools, we're still fighting an uphill battle. And those third-party tools across both web and app have been impacted by platform policy changes. This has been particularly acute for web-based advertisers and has led to an increase in a relative emphasis on same session, last click-based advertising, where we need to show that we are performant. We're still early in this journey. The platform policy changes, as you know, are an ever-evolving environment, but we do feel confident in our solutions and the opportunity ahead of us. We're going to focus on this problem holistically, and we believe that we're going to improve performance in parallel with how we're represented within third-party tools than we get credit for the conversions that we do drive. In turn, that will drive trust in our first-party solutions, which will then enable us to focus on optimizing towards these privacy-based observable actions, and that will drive our advertising flywheel. Thanks for the question. This is Jeremi. I can take this one. I think we're looking at macro pressures from a litany of different angles. We're hearing supply chain pressure, inflationary costs, of course, that are impacting unit economics as it pertains to moving product. They're getting pressure from the cost of capital, as we've talked about before, capital being more expensive as well as drying up in different areas.  So insofar as any of those are transitory, I think that's yet to play out in the overall macro. But what we're hearing from advertisers, I think, more specifically as it pertains to advertising budgets is what we said before, which is that they are taking this time, given all of those other macro pressures, to reevaluate their priorities to ensure that they're making the right investments in the right places. And when we talk about digital advertising, it is the easiest thing to turn off.  I know we said that a couple of different times, but I think it's important to reiterate here, is that it is the most important thing to turn off. But it is also one of the most performant tools in their tool chest. So as things start to rebound for some of these advertisers in the areas where the macro pressures are a little bit more transitory, it's also the first thing to get turned back on. So we remain optimistic that as things hopefully start to improve in the macro that we can capture that opportunity by remaining focused on the 3 key priorities that we've articulated in the call earlier."

With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Evan.\nEvan Spiegel: Thank you all so much for joining us. The first quarter of 2022 proved more challenging than we had expected and our team was able to make significant progress against our goals despite the increased volatility in the operating environment. Our community grew 18% year-over-year to 332 million daily active users and revenue grew 38% year-over-year to $1.06 billion. This resulted in adjusted EBITDA of $64 million and free cash flow of $106 million, marking our third quarter of positive free cash flow. While we are pleased with our progress, given the macroeconomic environment, we also recognize that we have a significant amount of work to do to realize our long-term opportunity and we believe we are well positioned to invest through the turbulence. A great deal of our focus has been supporting our team members located in Ukraine and helping our Ukrainian colleagues. The war in Ukraine is heartbreaking for all of us, especially because Ukraine is the birthplace of Looksery, a company that laid the foundation for Snap\u2019s augmented reality platform. As we look forward to our Snap Partner Summit on April 28, where we will celebrate our partners and launch new products, our thoughts and prayers are with our Ukrainian team members and their families, not only because of these horrible circumstances, but because they have made so many of our innovations possible. We have remained focused on expanding our product offering and deepening engagement with our global community, which grew by 13 million daily active users in the quarter. The future of our business depends on the engagement of our community and we are pleased to see elevated growth rates in the rest of world region, where we added 10 million daily active users in the quarter. This rest of world growth follows our investments in building out the team and operations necessary to accelerate our growth in geographies where our community has demonstrated a clear product market fit with Snapchat as well as our efforts to localize our product offering and improve application performance across a wide range of devices. Our community in North America and Europe continued to grow and these geographies represent our largest monetization opportunities in the near and medium term. We believe that reinventing the camera represents our greatest opportunity to improve the way people live and communicate. What began as an application for visual communication has evolved into a leading augmented reality platform, where creators are building unique and innovative AR experiences in Lens Studio and distributing them on Snapchat and in their own applications using Camera Kit. Over 250 million Snapchatters engage with augmented reality everyday on average across a variety of use cases, including entertainment, fashion and education. Over 250,000 creators have built more than 2.5 million lenses and Snapchatters played with lenses created by our community more than twice as much this quarter when compared to Q1 2021. We recently launched our ASL Alphabet Lens, a first-of-its-kind AR experience that inspires Snapchatters to learn American Sign Language through the Snapchat Camera. The ASL Alphabet Lens uses advanced hand tracking to recognize hand poses and gestures, providing feedback as people practice communicating with sign language. We also launched Custom Landmarkers in Lens Studio, helping creators to build location-based lenses for local places they care about, from statues to storefronts, to tell richer stories about their communities through AR. In partnership with Tukwini Mandela and Black Cultural Archives, we released our Hidden Black Stories\u2019 local lens, transforming London\u2019s Trafalgar Square into an AR experience that showcases key moments, figures and stories from Black British history. In an effort to educate our community on the power of AR, we announced a new augmented reality creator program in India powered by Lens Studio. The program will include an online developer course and a series of challenges that aim to empower developers and local creators across the country. In celebration of International Women\u2019s Day, we launched an AR Lensathon consisting of three workshops across Southeast Asia to encourage the participation of young women in new digital fields like augmented reality. We believe that augmented reality belongs everywhere, not just on Snapchat. We built Camera Kit to enable our partners to leverage our augmented reality platform in their own websites and applications. Through Camera Kit, we can help grow the ecosystem of AR developers and help businesses understand the immense potential of AR. We are excited by the growing demand from businesses, who want to bring Snap\u2019s AR capabilities into their own apps and websites. For example, Zoog, a storytelling app for families, integrated Camera Kit to help people bond by sharing stories while using lenses to resemble storybook characters. We continue to make meaningful progress overlaying computing on the world through Spectacles, our augmented reality glasses. Hundreds of creators are developing AR lenses for Spectacles, building new immersive and interactive experiences like reimagining a restaurant menu in three dimensions or enhancing a workout routine. We have continued to make software improvements and offer new capabilities for developers, including a new voice ML template in Lens Studio, which enables creators to build voice-enabled experiences without scripting and Lens Studio streaming mode, which helps creators develop lenses with hand tracking from a first person perspective. With our powerful developer tools in Lens Studio and distribution through Snapchat, Camera Kit and Spectacles, we have created a compelling platform for creators to build and share augmented reality experiences, reaching hundreds of millions of people and exploring the next generation of computing. We continue to provide value for our growing community through our diverse content offerings, which include our two content platforms, Stories and Spotlight. Our Stories platform enables Snapchatters to share snaps with their friends in narrative form via friend stories and watch content from professional publishers and influencers in Discover. Spotlight is our newest content platform for showcasing the most entertaining snaps created by our community. In Q1, overall time spent watching content globally grew on a year-over-year basis driven primarily by growth in time spent with content in Discover and Spotlight. We continue to see growth in viewership of content on Discover, which has become a destination for credible and entertaining content for our community. For example, total daily time spent by Snapchatters 25 and older, engaging with shows and publisher content on Discover, increased by more than 25% year-over-year. We expanded our international content offerings by partnering with News UK, TF1 and Le Monde in France and MBC and Al Arabiya in the Middle East. Snap Originals represent another important element of our strategy to improve the diversity of available content on Discover. Over 10 million viewers have watched Breakwater, our new Snap Original about the dystopian future caused by climate change that featured episodic AR lenses in partnership with Verizon, helping Snapchatters to immerse themselves in the show. Our content partners continue to find success on our platform with 6 Discover partners reaching over 100 million global viewers in Q1. We are also investing in new tools and capabilities to better serve our content partners and to help them reach new audiences on Snapchat. We recently announced Dynamic stories and new Discover format that allows publishers to automatically create stories based on news they publish online to help Snapchatters learn about the world as it happens. Early partners include GQ, Vogue, CNN, ESPN and The Wall Street Journal. We are very excited about the long-term potential of Spotlight. While still early in its growth and evolution, we are pleased with the engagement we are seeing with total time spent growing 230% year-over-year. Over the last several months, we have focused on building the tools and infrastructure to help creators of all kinds thrive on Spotlight and we observed a 3.5x increase in the number of Spotlight submissions using our AR lenses or Creative Tools compared with Q1 2021. Spotlight offers opportunities for creators to improve discoverability and get more reach with their snaps. We continue to focus on the relationship between Stories and Spotlight where creators can use Spotlight to start building an audience and deepen their relationship with that audience through their stories. Today, there are many different ways for creators to grow an audience and build a business on Snapchat. Creators can open shops to sell merchandise, join our creator marketplace, receive virtual gifts from fans and monetize their content via our recently announced mid-roll ads in Stories. We continue to innovate on our map to bring utility and value to our community and partners. As Snapchatters are able to move about the world again, we are seeing upticks in engagement on the Map. While still very early, we are encouraged to see that Snapchatters open places from the Map more than twice as often this quarter when compared to Q1 2021. We also added a new way to help Snapchatters discover live events with the launch of our Ticketmaster layer. Snapchatters can now browse Ticketmaster\u2019s upcoming events on the Map based on what is happening nearby. We see incredible potential for innovation across our communications platform, which brings enormous value to our community by connecting people with their close friends and family. In addition to adding several new chat features, including Chat Replies, Bitmoji reactions and poll stickers, it\u2019s also where our community can launch Games and Minis, two platforms built to reimagine shared experiences with friends. We were pleased to see returning gaming partners, Funday Factory and Voodoo launch new game titles in Q1. Our gaming partners are finding success growing their businesses with more than one-third of our current gaming partners having made over $1 million in revenue. Minis represent a new platform for social experiences. We have seen recent momentum with Givingli\u2019s second Mini Send Gifts where Snapchatters can send gift cards to friends. Discover partner, Wave Sports and Entertainment, launched the Gym Heroes Mini, a social fitness experience on Snapchat that offers original daily fitness challenges and full workouts curated by fitness experts. The Mini is designed for Snapchatters to challenge their friends and collaborating groups toward their workout goals. We are so excited about the growth of our community and the evolution of our service and we can\u2019t wait to share more at our Snap Partner Summit next week on April 28. We will meet the challenges of the current operating environment by prioritizing the needs of our community and partners, who are essential to our success and we will continue to invest against our enormous opportunity in augmented reality as we work to accelerate our roadmap and deliver against our long-term plans for computing overlaid on the world. I will now turn it over to Jeremi to discuss more about our business.\nJeremi Gorman: Thanks, Evan. We continue to make progress against the many opportunities we have to support our community and advertising partners globally. In Q1, we generated total revenue of $1.06 billion, an increase of 38% year-over-year. We continued to work through platform policy changes, which are primarily impacting direct response advertising partners and we believe that we are building effective measurement solutions for advertisers to prove the efficacy of their campaigns. In addition to these ongoing platform-related headwinds, supply chain shortages and labor disruptions, rising inflation and geopolitical unrest are presenting challenges for a wider array of industry verticals than in the prior quarter. Nonetheless, we saw strong growth in verticals like financial services and streaming, which each grew well over 50% year-over-year. We believe that the impact from the ongoing platform policy changes was compounded by macroeconomic challenges, which are now the primary headwinds to client demands. We remain focused on supporting our community and advertising partners. We will do so by continuing to focus on our three key priorities: first, driving measurable ROI; second, deepening our vertical expertise and growing our sales capacity; third, creating innovative ad formats focused on video and augmented reality. Our commitment to these priorities, along with our unique reach and global growing audience allows us to drive performance at scale for businesses around the world. Our team continues to help advertisers navigate the platform policy changes through the enablement and utilization of privacy-preserving measurement solutions. We have made a significant push to improve our first-party solutions as we seek to help advertisers adapt to the platform policy changes. The first step was to drive broad availability of these solutions, which we have largely achieved. Now we are working towards achieving broad utilization of and full confidence in these measurement solutions. While it can take time for advertisers to tune their campaigns using our new measurement solutions, some advertisers who have invested early in our first-party solutions are seeing signs of success. Beauty brands, Nice One, implemented our conversions API, or CAPI on both web and app to deepen its partnership with Snap and leverage the full integration across its platform. After integrating CAPI for web and app, the multi-product integration resulted in a 6x increase in return on ad spend above its non-integrated results. We also continue to innovate by improving our first-party measurement solutions with features like estimated conversions, which helps provide more granular and timely results in a privacy safe manner and improvements to CAPI, which strengthens Snap\u2019s direct advertiser data integration, allowing advertisers to measure conversions from multiple sources. Launched in 2018, CAPI also provides advertisers with more sophisticated incremental measurement solutions such as conversion lift. For example, sports betting company, DraftKings, ran a conversion lift study in the 2 weeks leading up to the Super Bowl across several established sports book states and observed a 10.8% lift in app installs and a 188% lift in first-time deposits for male 21 plus, outpacing their install and deposit goals. As we continue working to drive measurable ROI for advertisers of all sizes, improving the efficiency of our offering and lowering the effort it takes to utilize our platform is a major focus. By lowering the cost and decreasing the time to create personalized ads, we can improve ROI by reducing the investment it takes to achieve a given return. One notable example is our progress with Dynamic Ads. By dynamically building ads for product catalogs, we are able to greatly expand the set of ads that are created. Dynamic Ads can update automatically as new products are entered into the catalog remaining up-to-date and driving ROI. As a result, revenue from Dynamic Ads more than tripled year-over-year. In addition to Dynamic Ads, we are also increasing the automation of our Ad Suite through multi-format ad delivery, which allows our systems to optimize across formats to achieve the best ROI for our advertisers in the most relevant ads for our community. These features reduce setup time, increase delivery efficiency and expand advertiser\u2019s addressable audience. We are seeing strong adoption of our automated offerings and we will prioritize these efforts in the year ahead. We continue to add deep domain expertise with our verticalized sales strategy, allowing us to effectively serve advertisers of all types and sizes. Our work with agency and advertising partners over the past year has resulted in upfront commitments for 2022 that are more than 60% higher than the total upfront commitments made in 2021. We view upfront commitments as a signal of strong confidence from agency and advertising partners as we become a part of their always-on performance-oriented advertising strategy. While the majority of our revenue today is generated from video ads, we believe we are still early in terms of realizing the full monetization potential of our content platform. Today, we comprise less than 2% of the $210 billion U.S. digital ad market and less than 1% of the $520 billion global digital ad market, while reaching nearly half of U.S. smartphone users and more than 75% of 13 to 34 year olds in over 20 countries. In addition, mobile advertising is growing faster than desktop advertising, video advertising is growing faster than non-video advertising and self-serve advertising is expected to make up 90% of all digital display ad spend in 2022. These trends are favorable for our strategy and we believe our video advertising business has the potential to deliver robust top line growth. Our unique and innovative AR lenses give our team a huge opportunity to attract advertisers across multiple verticals. In the past, larger brands use augmented reality for brand moments to drive awareness and reach through expensive one-day takeover lenses. Today, both brand and performance-oriented advertisers are utilizing augmented reality to drive significant and measurable business results. We are also adding more tools to help our advertising partners find customers and build their businesses on Snapchat. We launched our first SNAP AR certification on Snap Focus called Augmented Reality Strategies for Advertisers. This five-part learning pathway offers hands-on education and real life examples to help advertisers gain a deeper understanding of how AR is an essential tool for business and marketing objectives. We continue to invest in Arcadia, our global creative studio for branded augmented reality experiences. The team has been hard at work creating, managing and launching several experiences. Most recently, a Verizon 5G connected Snapchat Lens for the big game in our hometown of L.A., letting Snapchatters team up and battle with other groups to take control of a giant virtual airship hovering above the field. Arcadia also created a 5G AR lens in partnership with Verizon and Cirque du Soleil that transports the renowned O performance in Las Vegas to the palm of a Snapchatters hand. We have a notable acceleration in the number of advertisers leveraging our self-service tools for AR with over 70% of AR revenue now delivered via our self-serve ad platform. We recently brought our GBB pixel purchase optimization to AR and we are also investing in additional features for ad manager to make it easier for advertisers to create, manage and deploy their AR experiences. Following the launch of First Commercial in October 2020, we recently launched First Lens, which enables advertisers to reserve the first sponsored lens impression of Snapchatter seasonal lens carousel. First Lens offers more operational ease, because bookings are made through ads manager and it simultaneously improves the Snapchatter experience by surfacing the First Lens based on relevance. A top priority for AR is reducing the barrier to creation and helping brands understand the importance of AR experiences and the value they can drive. While we are still in the early stages of AR advertiser adoption, we are already making solid progress and investing to build the AR ecosystem. For example, Nike recently launched its Nike By You Sneaker customization lens in order to drive increased engagement with its Nike app and generate membership sign-ups. The multi-cell campaign resulted in an increase in sign-ups, especially among 13 to 17 year olds, a key demographic for Nike\u2019s program. After the success of the AR campaign in the U.S., Nike has scaled its lens campaign to additional regions internationally. These results are emblematic of a larger shift we\u2019re seeing with AR transforming e-commerce by increasing conversion rates. We believe that virtual try-on represents a massive opportunity to improve the way our community shops and experiences new products. Businesses are benefiting from creating their own public profile, which offers a free permanent home on Snapchat, where they can showcase compelling AR experiences and share shoppable products directly within the app. Online retail platform GOAT recently created a profile and uploaded two AR shoe try-on lenses. In the first week alone, they sought over 1 million plays, encouraging GOAT to further invest in their Snapchat presence. We are seeing higher retention for advertisers who have activated their public profile, a promising early indication than an organic presence on Snapchat is meaningful for advertiser return on ad spend. Lastly, when brands use a portfolio approach of combining sponsored AR lenses with Snap Ads, they are able to drive higher ROI and lower cost per outcome. For example, Electronic Arts ran a campaign for its Madden NFL \u201822 video game franchise, which included Commercial, Snap Ads, Lenses, Filters and Story Ads, where each of these products saw a significant lift in higher and lower funnel metrics. For Snapchatters that we\u2019re exposed to all three ad products, we saw even higher lift. This is why we are so excited about multi-format delivery, which enables these types of campaigns with greater ease. While the macro operating environment remains challenging and difficult to predict, we continue to invest in product innovation to help advertising partners scale, build strong relationships with advertisers across verticals and improve our targeting and measurement capabilities for businesses. Based on the size of our audience, there are high levels of engagement across our service and our overall opportunity in the growing digital advertising market, we believe we are well positioned to drive business results for advertisers over the long-term. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Derek.\nDerek Andersen: Thanks, Jeremi. Our Q1 financial results reflect our priorities of growing our community, making focused investments in the future of our business and scaling our operations efficiently in order to drive towards profitability and positive free cash flow. As Evan mentioned earlier, our community grew to 332 million daily active users in Q1, an increase of 52 million or 18% year-over-year. In North America, DAU grew by 5% year-over-year to reach 98 million. In Europe, DAU grew by 10% to reach 84 million. In rest of world, DAU grew by 36% to reach 150 million as we continue to invest in local language support, local content, local marketing partnerships and support from local creator communities. Total revenue for Q1 was $1.63 billion, an increase of 38% year-over-year. Revenue growth in Q1 initially exceeded our expectations entering the quarter, with year-over-year growth of approximately 44% through February 23. In the days immediately following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, we observed that a large number of advertisers initially paused their campaigns. The vast majority of clients resumed their campaigns within 10 days following the invasion. And daily average revenue in March exceeded pre-invasion levels, but the rate of year-over-year growth remained below pre-invasion levels at approximately 32% from February 24 through the end of Q1. The slowdown in the rate of year-over-year growth observed post the invasion of Ukraine was broad-based, with the deceleration evident in both our direct response and brand advertising businesses, and to many industry verticals. In the latter portion of Q1, advertisers in a wider variety of industry groups reported concerns related to the macro operating environment, including continued supply chain disruptions rising input costs, economic concerns due to rising interest rates and concerns related to geopolitical risks stemming from the war in Ukraine. While the impact of these headwinds was felt broadly, our brand advertising business grew at a relatively slower rate of 26% year-over-year in Q1, as new headwinds built on top of supply chain and labor supply headwinds already impacting a subset of industry sectors coming into this quarter. Despite the challenging operating environment, we were encouraged by the progress in our direct response advertising business with a year-over-year growth rate of 43% for the full quarter and nearly 50% prior to the invasion of Ukraine. A small subset of lower funnel app-based GBBs such as in-app purchase continued to be the most impacted by the platform policy changes. The rollout of our privacy-preserving first-party measurement solutions continues to progress with these solutions now enabled for advertisers representing more than 90% of direct response advertising revenue. We are cautiously optimistic that the partners who utilize these lower funnel GBBs will benefit from the more holistic and timely measurement of results that our first-party measurement solutions afford as they build confidence in them over time. We believe that our continued focus on driving measurable returns on advertising for our partners will be critical to the long-term success of our advertising partners, the best we have ever reported for this metric as a public company, down from $0.62 in the prior year and $0.66 in the prior quarter. With global ARPU growing at 17% year-over-year and infrastructure cost per DAU declining by 6% over the same period, efficient scaling of our cloud infrastructure was the largest driver of expanding gross margins. We have now completed new multiyear agreements with both of our large infrastructure partners, and the lower pricing from these agreements drove the majority of the sequential improvement in cost per DAU. We believe that the progress we have made in driving down our unit costs over time, especially in an inflationary environment, provides powerful validation for our asset-light infrastructure model, which has, in turn, allowed us to hold CapEx investment at less than 2% of revenue over the trailing 12 months. The growing scale of our cloud partners and their resulting efficiency are flowing through to our pricing. At the same time, our multi-cloud approach and the growing scale of our community and our improving operational excellence in managing our unit costs have worked together to expand our adjusted gross margin by 22 percentage points over the last 3 years. The operating leverage we have realized from scaling our infrastructure costs efficiently, is a key input towards our ability to invest in the long-term growth of our business, while making continued progress towards sustaining positive free cash flow generation. Adjusted operating expenses were $586 million in Q1, up 60% year-over-year, reflecting a combination of our ongoing rate of investment in the business as well as several factors that are further elevating our adjusted operating expense growth rate in the near-term. As expected, our rate of hiring stepped up in Q1, while our rate of attrition remains low. Total personnel costs were up 52% year-over-year, driven by a 52% increase in full-time head count. This reflects ongoing investments in our team as well as the integration of acquisitions completed over the last year, which contributed approximately 9 percentage points of the year-over-year growth in full-time headcount in Q1. Marketing was the next largest driver of year-over-year adjusted operating expense growth. with total marketing spending more than doubling year-over-year in Q1, due in part to the timing of marketing campaigns and events relative to the prior year. We estimate the timing of marketing expenses elevated our overall adjusted operating expense growth rate by approximately 4 percentage points in Q1. In addition, we continue to see costs return to our cost structure that were otherwise diminished during the pandemic period, including travel, events and certain operations costs, which collectively contributed approximately 3 percentage points to the year-over-year growth rate in Q1. Finally, we incurred approximately $5 million in cost to support our team members impacted by the war in Ukraine during Q1, which further contributed to the elevated year-over-year growth in adjusted operating expenses. Adjusted EBITDA was $64 million in Q1, an improvement of $66 million year-over-year. We delivered adjusted EBITDA leverage of 23% in Q1 as we continue to invest in the future of our business while making progress towards sustained profitability and positive free cash flow. Net income was negative $360 million in Q1 compared to a loss of $287 million in Q1 of the prior year. The current quarter results include a $100 million year-over-year decline in other income, driven primarily by a $92 million unrealized loss on investment that became public in the second half of 2021. Excluding the impact of mark-to-market losses on this investment, net income would have improved by $19 million or 7% year-over-year to reach negative $267 million, which is due primarily to the flow-through of the $66 million improvement in adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by $19 million in higher stock-based compensation, $15 million higher depreciation and amortization, $7 million in higher taxes, and $6 million in other net expenses. While we have continued to grow our team and leverage stock-based compensation strategically to fostering ownership culture and drive long-term retention, we have remained focused on managing these programs responsibly. Total fully diluted shares grew 4.8% year-over-year in Q1, with the vast majority of this growth driven by $1.1 billion of early conversions of our outstanding convertible notes completed in 2021. Excluding dilution related to convertible notes, the rate of growth was 1.3% in Q1 compared with 1.2% in the prior quarter and 2.6% in the prior year. While we are pleased with the progress we have made on this metric, it is important to note that the dilution rate, in particular as it relates to SBC, tends to move inversely with our stock price. And thus can be subject to market forces over time. Free cash flow for Q1 was positive $106 million, and we ended the quarter with $5 billion in cash and marketable securities, up from $2.6 billion in the prior year, with the increase reflecting the proceeds of convertible notes and cash we have generated from operations. As we look forward to Q2, we are pleased with the momentum we have observed in our community, and our guidance for the quarter assumes DAU will be approximately 343 million to 345 million in Q2. On the revenue side, forward-looking visibility is as difficult today or perhaps more difficult than at any point in recent memory. While the 116% revenue growth we experienced in Q2 of the prior year makes the comparisons more difficult this quarter, we believe the bigger challenge to forward-looking visibility is the uncertain operating environment. The macro headwinds we observed in Q1, including supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, inflationary pressures, and the impact of rising interest rates on the overall economic environment, remains challenged as we enter Q2. We believe the impact of the war in Ukraine on input cost, marketing budgets and overall economic confidence has been significant and that it is difficult to predict its impact on a forward-looking basis. Given the uncertainty caused by these challenging circumstances, we have opted to share that our growth rate thus far in Q2 is approximately 30% year-over-year or just below the approximately 32% growth rate we observed following the invasion of Ukraine in Q1. That said, we are concerned that the operating environment ahead could be even more challenging, leading to further campaign pauses or advertiser budget reductions. As I noted earlier, our prior year comparisons are more difficult in Q2 than in Q1. Given this, we believe that revenue guidance of 20% to 25% year-over-year revenue growth in Q2 is reasonable. Given the abundance of opportunities we see to invest productively in our business, we continue to expect that 2022 will be a significant investment year. When the impact of new investments in 2022 are combined with the full year impact of investments made in 2021, we expect that a smaller share of incremental revenue will flow through to adjusted EBITDA and net income in 2022. While the operating environment is currently challenging, we believe that the progress we have made to deliver positive free cash flow over the trailing 12 months and the strength of our balance sheet with $5 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand have positioned us well to invest through the current environment. Continuing to invest through the current headwinds will allow us to build on the momentum we have established in our business in order to ensure we capture the immense long-term upside we see in the future of augmented reality. And we believe we can do so responsibly as we continue to thoughtfully prioritize our investments. Given our revenue guidance and our planned level of investment, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be between breakeven and $50 million in Q2. Thank you for joining our call today, and we will now take your questions.\nOperator: That concludes the prepared remarks for today\u2019s earnings call and we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRoss Sandler: Hey, guys. Just one question on the 2Q outlook and then one question on fingerprinting. So the first one, it sounds like your run rate is 30%, but you\u2019re expecting it to drop off as we progress through the quarter. So can you maybe just unpack a little more on what you\u2019re seeing or hearing out there in the industry that kind of explains that further reduction as we move through the quarter? I know it\u2019s kind of tough with the macro right now, but any additional color there would be helpful? And then the second one is, I think some folks on this call are just worried about another potential revenue hit from fingerprinting later this year. So can you maybe help us better understand how you\u2019ve reworked the measurement and targeting on your platform in a privacy-centric manner, as Jeremi mentioned, and whether or not you see that as a risk? Thanks a lot.\nDerek Andersen: Hi, Ross, it\u2019s Derek speaking. I\u2019ll take the first part of your question, and then I\u2019ll hand it over to Jeremi to help with the second part. So, at a high level on what we\u2019re seeing as we look forward to Q2, the operating environment remains challenging and forward-looking visibility, as I noted earlier, is more difficult than probably at any point in recent memory. We have shared that our business has grown at a rate of approximately 30% quarter-over-quarter to-date, but we\u2019re concerned that the operating environment could be even more challenging going forward. More specifically, the headwinds that impacted our business in Q1 have persisted into Q2, and we believe the impact of the war on Ukraine has been significant, and this impact is particularly difficult to predict going forward. As a result, we are concerned we could see additional campaign positives or advertiser budget reductions in the future. The comparisons, as I noted are also getting tougher. As a reminder, our top line growth accelerated by 50 percentage points in Q2 of last year to reach 115%. So, all of these factors together have informed our guide of 20% to 25% year-over-year in Q2. Importantly, though, I\u2019d say the fundamentals of our business remain intact. We\u2019re pleased with what we\u2019re seeing and the strong growth in DAU. We continue to have deep penetration of hard-to-reach demos in the most important advertising markets. And of course, we\u2019ve got a sophisticated ad platform that delivers measurable returns and results. So we are focused on investing in our teams and our products and delivering measurable return on advertising investment to our advertising partners. So hopefully, that gives you some background and context on how we\u2019re seeing the outlook going forward and what uncertainty \u2013 what\u2019s uncertain about that. I\u2019ll turn it over to Jeremi to take the second part there.\nJeremi Gorman: Hi, Ross, thank you for the question. So just to be specific around finger printing, for opt-out users, we do not meaningfully identify any user, who\u2019s opted out of tracking, and we do not fingerprint. There is no personally identifiable information that is directly linked to the customer. But given the platform changes, we have experienced signal loss, including IDSA and some IP addresses, and we expect that trend to continue. But if we take a step back, there are two different types of users. There is the opt-in ones and the opt-out users as well. For the opt-out users, we have deterministic measurement solutions that allow us to definitively match the conversion that\u2019s taken place, and that forms the basis of our measurement. Our privacy preserving measurement solutions, though, are built to adapt to signal loss like this which is a combination of opt-in user data and models estimated conversions to provide advertisers with a fidelity that they need to make decisions to grow their business. These changes, though, are \u2013 they are long. They take time. They put a serious onus on advertisers to adapt and reset their advertising campaigns across not just Snap, but all platforms. We empathize with them. We are working with them through these changes, and we expect to continue to do that with relentless focus on delivering ROI.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBrian Nowak: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Maybe Derek, I appreciate the quarter-to-date color on the business. Could you help us understand a little more how fast is the North America ad business growing quarter-to-date? And as part of the guide, are you assuming that the North America business gets worse? And are you hearing that from advertisers yet? That\u2019s part one. And then part two, I may have missed it, but what was the impression versus pricing growth in the quarter just so we can sort of put together those two factors? Thanks.\nDerek Andersen: Brian, it\u2019s Derek speaking. So, on the first question, when we looked at the pre and post period in Q1, where we saw the decel in the revenue growth rate post the invasion in Ukraine, we look at that across a number of different cuts. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we saw that deceleration of the DR and the brand side of our business regions as well as across or our different advertising partner verticals. So, it\u2019s relatively broad-based. So, I am not \u2013 I don\u2019t have any additional color to break down what we have seen quarter-to-date, but as I said earlier, what we saw was pretty broad-based when we saw the initial slowdown there. So, it probably gives you a little bit of context. So, then in terms of breaking down pricing and impression growth, we did see CPMs rise in the current quarter of Q1. We are up around 40%, 41%. I believe quarter-over-quarter. So, we have seen most of the revenue growth translated through on the pricing side as we continue to focus on the experience for the community. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of perspective of both of those factors. Thank you for the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rich Greenfield with LightShed Partners. Please go ahead.\nRich Greenfield: Hi. First question for Evan. The use of 3D Bitmoji avatars in the prepared remarks, the commentary that I think you have all made on Maps today, it just feels quite clear that Maps plays a central role in the future of Snapchat. I was just hoping you could take a minute and get out of the minutia of the quarter and kind of step up to 50,000 feet and give us sort of the Evan or Snapchat vision for 5 years from now, in success, what does Maps look like? And then maybe just a follow-on for Jeremi to tie to this, assuming Evan and team can execute broadly on this Map\u2019s vision, where do brands and advertisers fit in? And what are they asking you for vis-\u00e0-vis the Map right now?\nEvan Spiegel: Hi Rich. Thanks so much for the question. And I always love to talk about the long-term. So, we are really excited about the Map opportunity, especially because our Map represents a totally different way to explore the world. Maps historically have been built for transportation to help people get from A to B. And our map is really designed to see what your friends are up to. To answer the question, where is somebody, when are they going to be home, what are my friends doing and of course, to help people explore the world through near real-time content on our Map around the world and now with places to learn more about all sorts of interesting popular and trending places around them. We are so excited that we just recently rolled out a new Ticketmaster layer that also helps people see upcoming events at venues nearby and even share those with friends and buy tickets. So, the way that our Map is transforming the way that our community is understanding the world around them and connecting with friends is super exciting and a huge opportunity over the long-term. And of course, we love the role that Bitmoji plays in all this and our action mojis on the Map that show when people are flying or driving. So, you can see where your friend is in transit. So, definitely a big and exciting opportunity for us long-term. I think as it pertains to the way that businesses participate on the Map, a lot of our recent focus has been around places. So, bringing businesses onto the Map, allowing chains, for example, to claim their businesses and actually, now we are testing just at the very, very early stages of testing folks running advertising against those places to drive people to locations nearby. So, that will be an interesting experiment. And then of course, our layers are also a way that businesses can interact with the Snap Map, and that will be an exciting place for us to invest going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Shmulik with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nMark Shmulik: Yes. Hi. Thanks. A couple of questions. The first for Evan, so the user guide is strong and I think you mentioned the magic words like product market fit in markets internationally. We know India is one of those markets, but are there any other stories or markets you could share where you have historically been underpenetrated that you are excited about the progress that you are seeing? And then second question for Jeremi. You talked last quarter about some of the re-org taking place and the push to expand kind of to more verticals, both here and abroad. I know you shared it kind at the top of the call, you are seeing some success in financials and streaming. But are there any other \u2013 is there any other traction you are seeing in perhaps non-traditional verticals either kind of here or abroad, would be great? Thank you.\nEvan Spiegel: Yes. So, on the user growth side, certainly a ton of opportunity around the world, especially in the rest of world region and in Europe. And what we are really excited about is this value that Snapchat has in connecting close friends and family through visual communication just continues to be really strong. People love sharing what they are up to visually. It\u2019s much more expressive. It\u2019s obviously much faster than text messaging. And so as we have done a lot of this work to localize our application to improve its performance, we are really unlocking that core product value for our community around the world. So, lots of great progress there. Hard to call out one country, in particular. Certainly, India has been a great success story for us. But that\u2019s been a big focus of ours, and we have now really organized our teams in our processes around scaling that growth around the world.\nJeremi Gorman: I can take the second part of the question. So, you have mentioned that we have talked about financial services and streaming being particularly strong categories. We believe that, that is true largely because their success isn\u2019t predicated on external factors, like supply chain as much or labor shortages or labor disruptions and these kinds of things. So, let me unpack that a little bit more for you. Globally when we take a look at just entertainment more broadly, you are starting to look at an ecosystem where things are being released in the theater and then also on streaming, creating two separate and distinct marketing budgets, from each of the studios that used to have on either theatrical only or during the pandemic, streaming only. And so that opens up a wide variety of budgets for it globally, as a lot of these movies like we saw with the Batman and the Spider Man films, are coming back to theaters and drove the snapshot generation certainly is interested in them. And then when it comes to the financial services, you mentioned traditional category, that is true with financial services that even more broadly, when you come \u2013 when it comes to things like apps for financial services and these kinds of things. Despite the overall conditions regarding app downloads, when it comes to platform changes in general, those are picking up steam as well. So, we are seeing all of those trends globally, and we think we are going to continue to see those trends globally and are continuing to invest in those categories, and we are really excited about it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. Evan, not to front run the Partner Summit next week, but can you give us a little sense of what you are most excited about on the product initiatives side with respect to commerce and how you think broadly and philosophically about commerce rather than media consumption as being the future of Snap and how that might even insulate you from future policy changes on some of the mobile platforms that we have talked about already? Thanks so much.\nEvan Spiegel: Yes. I think what we are most excited about, and of course, I will have to wait for our Partners Summit next week for specifics, but what we are most excited about is really this intersection between augmented reality and commerce. So, what we found as we have been growing our AR business over the years, that people use all sorts of accessories and fashion items to express themselves through augmented reality. And we found that by partnering with retailers and fashion brands, that if we can actually use their real products in augmented reality, it dramatically improves conversion for those businesses, and so it can lead to higher sales. And we have also done some work on fit and size to try and help people find the right size, which we found can really improve the rate of returns for merchants as well. And so we have the strategy really to use augmented reality to both improve the top and bottom line for retailers and, of course, radically improve the customer experience. I mean the idea that you can try on all these different looks and styles without ever changing your clothes is really transformational. I am really hoping it will make an impact in our household for sure. So, that I think has been a really exciting place for us to invest, and you have to wait until next week for the specifics.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. This is James on for Brent. Thanks for taking my questions. Last quarter, you called out lower story posting as a headwind to your growth. Did you see a noticeable uptick in posting activity coming out of Omicron? Curious if this had any meaningful impact on your advertising revenue this quarter and just what you are assuming for Q2? And then the second part of my question is just around your headcount growth, it\u2019s been accelerating every quarter. Could you just talk about where you are allocating most of those new employees, any particular geographies or products that are gaining the bulk of those new heads? Thanks.\nDerek Andersen: Derek speaking. I can take those. I will start with the headcount growth one. We have seen the rate of hiring accelerate, as you noted, and I mentioned in the prepared remarks, while our attrition rate has remained very low, and this has driven the growth in personnel costs that you saw in Q1. Total personnel costs curve about 52% in Q1 driven by a 52% increase in headcount sort of in lock set there. I would note that the growth in personnel costs and headcount includes the impact of acquisitions integrated over the past year, many of which were completed in the second half of last year, which contributed approximately 9% points on the year-over-year growth rate in the current quarter. So, we have been hiring against a number of priorities. We have mentioned in our previous quarters that we have accelerated our investment in our sales and sales support in our priority monetization markets where we already have deep penetration of hard-to-reach demographics. In addition, we have been investing heavily in our engineering and product teams to build on the momentum we have established our community and our business, which have helped to drive a rapid pace of innovation on our platform and we look forward to sharing more of that at our Partner Summit, which was just mentioned, which is coming out soon. And then last, but definitely not least, we have been investing aggressively in building the future of augmented reality in order to capture, we believe that the immense long-term upside there in the future of this new computing platform. As you will note from our investor deck, many of the acquisitions we have integrated in recent years have been in service of pulling forward our AR roadmaps among other roadmaps for the benefit of our community, and our advertising partners. So anyway, hopefully, that mixture of factors gives you a little better sense of what\u2019s happening with the growth there in as well as the cost base. And then in terms of your second question, on the story posting question specifically, the number of story posters grew year-over-year in Q1. But as it relates to the revenue outlook looking forward, the primary factor here by far is what we are seeing on the demand side and the challenges we are seeing in the operating environment and how those factors may impact demand going forward in Q2. So, that\u2019s the primary influence on the guide. I talked about that in some detail earlier, so I won\u2019t repeat that there, but hopefully, that gives you a better sense of the mix of what\u2019s impacting the forward-looking revenue into Q2.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. Please go ahead.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thanks. A couple of questions, if I can. First, just following up on Ross\u2019 question on the outlook for 2Q. If we look specifically, April sounds like it was, at least to-date is pretty solid. If we look to May and June, do comps actually get harder relative to April from here? And then second one, you mentioned, I think 70% of AR revenue is now delivered via the self-serve platform with a growing mix of DR advertisers. Can you kind of help us contextualize the magnitude? Is AR advertising, is it 5% of revenue, is it 15%, like ballpark, how meaningful is it? And ultimately, are we at a place where it\u2019s resonating enough on the DR side that it can really scale up and move the overall needle this year or next year? Anything you can share there would be helpful. Thanks.\nDerek Andersen: Thanks Eric. I will take the first part, and then I will turn it over to Jeremi to talk about the second part. Just in terms of the guide, yes, look, the quarter-to-date number being approximately 30% year-over-year is a reasonably good start to the quarter, relatively consistent with what we have seen in the back half of Q1. In terms of the comps, obviously, the 50 percentage point acceleration in the prior year means the comps throughout this quarter are very difficult. And of course, we continue growing our business the way we have. The comps get tougher in general. Over time, we have to be able to grow the business sequentially throughout the year. So, it is tough throughout the quarter. Obviously, our guide reflects our concerns about the operating environment and some of the factors that I mentioned earlier that caused us to be concerned that the operating environment could become even more difficult as we move through the quarter going forward. So, hopefully, that gives you a sense of how we thought about that and some of the texture in the quarter. I will turn it over to Jeremi for the second part of your question.\nJeremi Gorman: Yes. As you heard from Evan earlier in that call, we are extremely excited about the long-term opportunity that AR and AR advertising have for our business. We see AR as a consumer-centric shift to our community in shopping and experiencing new products. When you look at things like virtual trial that are being utilized by our community, people are really wanting to visualize how things look on them, not just on a website or on a model or something like that, and AR provides them that opportunity. In general, we have 250 million people engaging with AR every single day. And when you start to see consumer trends lead like that, it\u2019s really just a matter of time until advertising dollars follow, although that will continue to take time and work and effort. So, we believe it\u2019s our biggest opportunity for the long-term. We are really excited about it. And as brands are starting to build their always on AR strategies, it\u2019s even more important. We continue to invest heavily in building the tools to make that easier for them. Making it easier to create AR, to manage AR, and deploy the AR experiences, and then give them places like Public Profiles for those AR experiences to live evergreen. You start to see businesses, we mentioned last quarter like MAC and Ulta, makeup brands that are already finding incredible success by leveraging our Lens web builder tool. And we know that, that AR as a utility is going to be something that\u2019s incredibly important for businesses going forward. We talked about Nike in the prepared remarks as well. We believe that AR represents this shift, as I mentioned, which I think is really important. And then it will help to increase conversion for retailers, which is really important as well. We are getting the products into the proverbial hands of the customers and then converting that into a sale, hopefully reducing returns, impacting a lot of really great metrics from the retailer side. And we believe that this shift towards e-commerce is a long-term secular shift. So, the way that \u2013 any way that we can help improve conversions and/or the shopping experience for the Snapchat community, we are all in and couldn\u2019t be more excited about the AR advertising opportunity ahead of us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with ISI. Please go ahead.\nMark Mahaney: Thanks. I will just ask one question about Spotlight monetization, and it sounded like you have recently started to introduce mid-roll ads in there. Just talk about the traction you are seeing. The path to, I don\u2019t know, what is full monetization? Are there particular \u2013 are those kind of ads bringing in a new type of advertiser to the platform? So, just talk about what the traction you have seen so far? And any expectations for how long it will take to fully monetize? Thank you.\nEvan Spiegel: Hey Mark, thanks so much for the question. Yes, we have definitely begun testing advertising in Spotlight, although that testing is still quite limited. We have rolled out mid-roll ads in stories for creators. And we have actually seen something, a really exciting sort of phenomenon take off on Snapchat, where Creators are using Spotlight and posting videos to Spotlight to try to get more distribution and attract more subscribers to their story, and then they posted their story to build a deeper relationship with their subscribers and share revenue with us on mid-roll advertising inserted within that story. So, I think this is going to be another great way that we can really serve creators and continue to deepen the content experience on Snapchat. And as we mentioned, we are really excited about the momentum and growth of Spotlight and all the incredible original content that\u2019s being created by our community. So, we will continue to be investing there and of course, testing advertising on Spotlight, because we think it\u2019s going to be a great place for advertisers. Unfortunately, the Spotlight format is full-screen vertical video, which is a format that we pioneered and that advertisers all over the world have adopted. So, it does make it quite seamless to transfer those advertisements over to the Spotlight platform.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Maria Ripps with Canaccord. Please go ahead.\nMaria Ripps: Great. Thanks so much for squeezing me in. I just wanted to ask about your privacy changes. Can you maybe just talk about improving \u2013 well you talked about improving first-party solutions and working towards broader utilization. Can you just talk about where you are in the adoption curve among your advertiser base? And from a technical standpoint, what does it take to implement those solutions?\nJeremi Gorman: Yes. Hi Maria, I can take that one. This is Jeremi. Thank you for the question. So, I want to take a step back here and talk about measurement and optimization, which is an ongoing process. As you have probably heard me say in each of the last calls, this has been our relentless focus and our priorities since we launched our performance-driven self-serve ad platform. We have been constantly working to improve ROI for advertisers with new products, new solutions, better targeting, better optimization, and better measurement. And this is something that will continue. The reality is that our work here is truly never done. We are again, relentlessly focused on ensuring that this measurement and optimization continues to deliver the best ROI for advertisers. We know that when we do deliver that ROI, it\u2019s the most retentive that we \u2013 behavior that we can do to make sure that we get more advertisers on the platform that we develop a reputation for being a performance platform and, therefore, attract more advertisers. We have more than not only quality, but quantity of advertisements to show to our community. So, they get more relevant ads. It performs better, and so the flywheel continues. We are pleased with the progress that we are making. Prior to the invasion of Ukraine, our direct response business was growing at nearly 50% year-over-year and the full quarter was 43% year-over-year. But when you talk about progress, it\u2019s a three-step journey. So first, we need to enable the solution, which makes it possible to use these tools. Then we have to \u2013 then advertisers have to actively utilize them. And then the third step in that journey is to build trust and confidence in those solutions. The first-party solutions have been enabled for advertisers that represent 90% of our VR revenue. And then lastly, I just realized that earlier \u2013 in an earlier answer, I flipped the opt-in and opt-out information. So, I just wanted to clarify one of my earlier answers, which is that we have deterministic solutions for opt-out users. I meant to say opt-in, but hopefully that helps to clarify my earlier remarks, and thank you for the question.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session as well as Snap Inc.\u2019s first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Thank you for attending today\u2019s session. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Derek Andersen",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeremi. Our Q1 financial results reflect our priorities of growing our community, making focused investments in the future of our business and scaling our operations efficiently in order to drive towards profitability and positive free cash flow. As Evan mentioned earlier, our community grew to 332 million daily active users in Q1, an increase of 52 million or 18% year-over-year. In North America, DAU grew by 5% year-over-year to reach 98 million. In Europe, DAU grew by 10% to reach 84 million. In rest of world, DAU grew by 36% to reach 150 million as we continue to invest in local language support, local content, local marketing partnerships and support from local creator communities. Total revenue for Q1 was $1.63 billion, an increase of 38% year-over-year. Revenue growth in Q1 initially exceeded our expectations entering the quarter, with year-over-year growth of approximately 44% through February 23. In the days immediately following Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 24, we observed that a large number of advertisers initially paused their campaigns. The vast majority of clients resumed their campaigns within 10 days following the invasion. And daily average revenue in March exceeded pre-invasion levels, but the rate of year-over-year growth remained below pre-invasion levels at approximately 32% from February 24 through the end of Q1. The slowdown in the rate of year-over-year growth observed post the invasion of Ukraine was broad-based, with the deceleration evident in both our direct response and brand advertising businesses, and to many industry verticals. In the latter portion of Q1, advertisers in a wider variety of industry groups reported concerns related to the macro operating environment, including continued supply chain disruptions rising input costs, economic concerns due to rising interest rates and concerns related to geopolitical risks stemming from the war in Ukraine. While the impact of these headwinds was felt broadly, our brand advertising business grew at a relatively slower rate of 26% year-over-year in Q1, as new headwinds built on top of supply chain and labor supply headwinds already impacting a subset of industry sectors coming into this quarter. Despite the challenging operating environment, we were encouraged by the progress in our direct response advertising business with a year-over-year growth rate of 43% for the full quarter and nearly 50% prior to the invasion of Ukraine. A small subset of lower funnel app-based GBBs such as in-app purchase continued to be the most impacted by the platform policy changes. The rollout of our privacy-preserving first-party measurement solutions continues to progress with these solutions now enabled for advertisers representing more than 90% of direct response advertising revenue. We are cautiously optimistic that the partners who utilize these lower funnel GBBs will benefit from the more holistic and timely measurement of results that our first-party measurement solutions afford as they build confidence in them over time. We believe that our continued focus on driving measurable returns on advertising for our partners will be critical to the long-term success of our advertising partners, the best we have ever reported for this metric as a public company, down from $0.62 in the prior year and $0.66 in the prior quarter. With global ARPU growing at 17% year-over-year and infrastructure cost per DAU declining by 6% over the same period, efficient scaling of our cloud infrastructure was the largest driver of expanding gross margins. We have now completed new multiyear agreements with both of our large infrastructure partners, and the lower pricing from these agreements drove the majority of the sequential improvement in cost per DAU. We believe that the progress we have made in driving down our unit costs over time, especially in an inflationary environment, provides powerful validation for our asset-light infrastructure model, which has, in turn, allowed us to hold CapEx investment at less than 2% of revenue over the trailing 12 months. The growing scale of our cloud partners and their resulting efficiency are flowing through to our pricing. At the same time, our multi-cloud approach and the growing scale of our community and our improving operational excellence in managing our unit costs have worked together to expand our adjusted gross margin by 22 percentage points over the last 3 years. The operating leverage we have realized from scaling our infrastructure costs efficiently, is a key input towards our ability to invest in the long-term growth of our business, while making continued progress towards sustaining positive free cash flow generation. Adjusted operating expenses were $586 million in Q1, up 60% year-over-year, reflecting a combination of our ongoing rate of investment in the business as well as several factors that are further elevating our adjusted operating expense growth rate in the near-term. As expected, our rate of hiring stepped up in Q1, while our rate of attrition remains low. Total personnel costs were up 52% year-over-year, driven by a 52% increase in full-time head count. This reflects ongoing investments in our team as well as the integration of acquisitions completed over the last year, which contributed approximately 9 percentage points of the year-over-year growth in full-time headcount in Q1. Marketing was the next largest driver of year-over-year adjusted operating expense growth. with total marketing spending more than doubling year-over-year in Q1, due in part to the timing of marketing campaigns and events relative to the prior year. We estimate the timing of marketing expenses elevated our overall adjusted operating expense growth rate by approximately 4 percentage points in Q1. In addition, we continue to see costs return to our cost structure that were otherwise diminished during the pandemic period, including travel, events and certain operations costs, which collectively contributed approximately 3 percentage points to the year-over-year growth rate in Q1. Finally, we incurred approximately $5 million in cost to support our team members impacted by the war in Ukraine during Q1, which further contributed to the elevated year-over-year growth in adjusted operating expenses. Adjusted EBITDA was $64 million in Q1, an improvement of $66 million year-over-year. We delivered adjusted EBITDA leverage of 23% in Q1 as we continue to invest in the future of our business while making progress towards sustained profitability and positive free cash flow. Net income was negative $360 million in Q1 compared to a loss of $287 million in Q1 of the prior year. The current quarter results include a $100 million year-over-year decline in other income, driven primarily by a $92 million unrealized loss on investment that became public in the second half of 2021. Excluding the impact of mark-to-market losses on this investment, net income would have improved by $19 million or 7% year-over-year to reach negative $267 million, which is due primarily to the flow-through of the $66 million improvement in adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by $19 million in higher stock-based compensation, $15 million higher depreciation and amortization, $7 million in higher taxes, and $6 million in other net expenses. While we have continued to grow our team and leverage stock-based compensation strategically to fostering ownership culture and drive long-term retention, we have remained focused on managing these programs responsibly. Total fully diluted shares grew 4.8% year-over-year in Q1, with the vast majority of this growth driven by $1.1 billion of early conversions of our outstanding convertible notes completed in 2021. Excluding dilution related to convertible notes, the rate of growth was 1.3% in Q1 compared with 1.2% in the prior quarter and 2.6% in the prior year. While we are pleased with the progress we have made on this metric, it is important to note that the dilution rate, in particular as it relates to SBC, tends to move inversely with our stock price. And thus can be subject to market forces over time. Free cash flow for Q1 was positive $106 million, and we ended the quarter with $5 billion in cash and marketable securities, up from $2.6 billion in the prior year, with the increase reflecting the proceeds of convertible notes and cash we have generated from operations. As we look forward to Q2, we are pleased with the momentum we have observed in our community, and our guidance for the quarter assumes DAU will be approximately 343 million to 345 million in Q2. On the revenue side, forward-looking visibility is as difficult today or perhaps more difficult than at any point in recent memory. While the 116% revenue growth we experienced in Q2 of the prior year makes the comparisons more difficult this quarter, we believe the bigger challenge to forward-looking visibility is the uncertain operating environment. The macro headwinds we observed in Q1, including supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, inflationary pressures, and the impact of rising interest rates on the overall economic environment, remains challenged as we enter Q2. We believe the impact of the war in Ukraine on input cost, marketing budgets and overall economic confidence has been significant and that it is difficult to predict its impact on a forward-looking basis. Given the uncertainty caused by these challenging circumstances, we have opted to share that our growth rate thus far in Q2 is approximately 30% year-over-year or just below the approximately 32% growth rate we observed following the invasion of Ukraine in Q1. That said, we are concerned that the operating environment ahead could be even more challenging, leading to further campaign pauses or advertiser budget reductions. As I noted earlier, our prior year comparisons are more difficult in Q2 than in Q1. Given this, we believe that revenue guidance of 20% to 25% year-over-year revenue growth in Q2 is reasonable. Given the abundance of opportunities we see to invest productively in our business, we continue to expect that 2022 will be a significant investment year. When the impact of new investments in 2022 are combined with the full year impact of investments made in 2021, we expect that a smaller share of incremental revenue will flow through to adjusted EBITDA and net income in 2022. While the operating environment is currently challenging, we believe that the progress we have made to deliver positive free cash flow over the trailing 12 months and the strength of our balance sheet with $5 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand have positioned us well to invest through the current environment. Continuing to invest through the current headwinds will allow us to build on the momentum we have established in our business in order to ensure we capture the immense long-term upside we see in the future of augmented reality. And we believe we can do so responsibly as we continue to thoughtfully prioritize our investments. Given our revenue guidance and our planned level of investment, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be between breakeven and $50 million in Q2. Thank you for joining our call today, and we will now take your questions. Hi, Ross, it's Derek speaking. I'll take the first part of your question, and then I'll hand it over to Jeremi to help with the second part. So, at a high level on what we're seeing as we look forward to Q2, the operating environment remains challenging and forward-looking visibility, as I noted earlier, is more difficult than probably at any point in recent memory. We have shared that our business has grown at a rate of approximately 30% quarter-over-quarter to-date, but we're concerned that the operating environment could be even more challenging going forward. More specifically, the headwinds that impacted our business in Q1 have persisted into Q2, and we believe the impact of the war on Ukraine has been significant, and this impact is particularly difficult to predict going forward. As a result, we are concerned we could see additional campaign positives or advertiser budget reductions in the future. The comparisons, as I noted are also getting tougher. As a reminder, our top line growth accelerated by 50 percentage points in Q2 of last year to reach 115%. So, all of these factors together have informed our guide of 20% to 25% year-over-year in Q2. Importantly, though, I'd say the fundamentals of our business remain intact. We're pleased with what we're seeing and the strong growth in DAU. We continue to have deep penetration of hard-to-reach demos in the most important advertising markets. And of course, we've got a sophisticated ad platform that delivers measurable returns and results. So we are focused on investing in our teams and our products and delivering measurable return on advertising investment to our advertising partners. So hopefully, that gives you some background and context on how we're seeing the outlook going forward and what uncertainty \u2013 what's uncertain about that. I'll turn it over to Jeremi to take the second part there. Brian, it's Derek speaking. So, on the first question, when we looked at the pre and post period in Q1, where we saw the decel in the revenue growth rate post the invasion in Ukraine, we look at that across a number of different cuts. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we saw that deceleration of the DR and the brand side of our business regions as well as across or our different advertising partner verticals. So, it's relatively broad-based. So, I am not \u2013 I don't have any additional color to break down what we have seen quarter-to-date, but as I said earlier, what we saw was pretty broad-based when we saw the initial slowdown there. So, it probably gives you a little bit of context. So, then in terms of breaking down pricing and impression growth, we did see CPMs rise in the current quarter of Q1. We are up around 40%, 41%. I believe quarter-over-quarter. So, we have seen most of the revenue growth translated through on the pricing side as we continue to focus on the experience for the community. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of perspective of both of those factors. Thank you for the question. Derek speaking. I can take those. I will start with the headcount growth one. We have seen the rate of hiring accelerate, as you noted, and I mentioned in the prepared remarks, while our attrition rate has remained very low, and this has driven the growth in personnel costs that you saw in Q1. Total personnel costs curve about 52% in Q1 driven by a 52% increase in headcount sort of in lock set there. I would note that the growth in personnel costs and headcount includes the impact of acquisitions integrated over the past year, many of which were completed in the second half of last year, which contributed approximately 9% points on the year-over-year growth rate in the current quarter. So, we have been hiring against a number of priorities. We have mentioned in our previous quarters that we have accelerated our investment in our sales and sales support in our priority monetization markets where we already have deep penetration of hard-to-reach demographics. In addition, we have been investing heavily in our engineering and product teams to build on the momentum we have established our community and our business, which have helped to drive a rapid pace of innovation on our platform and we look forward to sharing more of that at our Partner Summit, which was just mentioned, which is coming out soon. And then last, but definitely not least, we have been investing aggressively in building the future of augmented reality in order to capture, we believe that the immense long-term upside there in the future of this new computing platform. As you will note from our investor deck, many of the acquisitions we have integrated in recent years have been in service of pulling forward our AR roadmaps among other roadmaps for the benefit of our community, and our advertising partners. So anyway, hopefully, that mixture of factors gives you a little better sense of what's happening with the growth there in as well as the cost base. And then in terms of your second question, on the story posting question specifically, the number of story posters grew year-over-year in Q1. But as it relates to the revenue outlook looking forward, the primary factor here by far is what we are seeing on the demand side and the challenges we are seeing in the operating environment and how those factors may impact demand going forward in Q2. So, that's the primary influence on the guide. I talked about that in some detail earlier, so I won't repeat that there, but hopefully, that gives you a better sense of the mix of what's impacting the forward-looking revenue into Q2. Thanks Eric. I will take the first part, and then I will turn it over to Jeremi to talk about the second part. Just in terms of the guide, yes, look, the quarter-to-date number being approximately 30% year-over-year is a reasonably good start to the quarter, relatively consistent with what we have seen in the back half of Q1. In terms of the comps, obviously, the 50 percentage point acceleration in the prior year means the comps throughout this quarter are very difficult. And of course, we continue growing our business the way we have. The comps get tougher in general. Over time, we have to be able to grow the business sequentially throughout the year. So, it is tough throughout the quarter. Obviously, our guide reflects our concerns about the operating environment and some of the factors that I mentioned earlier that caused us to be concerned that the operating environment could become even more difficult as we move through the quarter going forward. So, hopefully, that gives you a sense of how we thought about that and some of the texture in the quarter. I will turn it over to Jeremi for the second part of your question."

            "name": "Jeremi Gorman",
            "content": "Thanks, Evan. We continue to make progress against the many opportunities we have to support our community and advertising partners globally. In Q1, we generated total revenue of $1.06 billion, an increase of 38% year-over-year. We continued to work through platform policy changes, which are primarily impacting direct response advertising partners and we believe that we are building effective measurement solutions for advertisers to prove the efficacy of their campaigns. In addition to these ongoing platform-related headwinds, supply chain shortages and labor disruptions, rising inflation and geopolitical unrest are presenting challenges for a wider array of industry verticals than in the prior quarter. Nonetheless, we saw strong growth in verticals like financial services and streaming, which each grew well over 50% year-over-year. We believe that the impact from the ongoing platform policy changes was compounded by macroeconomic challenges, which are now the primary headwinds to client demands. We remain focused on supporting our community and advertising partners. We will do so by continuing to focus on our three key priorities: first, driving measurable ROI; second, deepening our vertical expertise and growing our sales capacity; third, creating innovative ad formats focused on video and augmented reality. Our commitment to these priorities, along with our unique reach and global growing audience allows us to drive performance at scale for businesses around the world. Our team continues to help advertisers navigate the platform policy changes through the enablement and utilization of privacy-preserving measurement solutions. We have made a significant push to improve our first-party solutions as we seek to help advertisers adapt to the platform policy changes. The first step was to drive broad availability of these solutions, which we have largely achieved. Now we are working towards achieving broad utilization of and full confidence in these measurement solutions. While it can take time for advertisers to tune their campaigns using our new measurement solutions, some advertisers who have invested early in our first-party solutions are seeing signs of success. Beauty brands, Nice One, implemented our conversions API, or CAPI on both web and app to deepen its partnership with Snap and leverage the full integration across its platform. After integrating CAPI for web and app, the multi-product integration resulted in a 6x increase in return on ad spend above its non-integrated results. We also continue to innovate by improving our first-party measurement solutions with features like estimated conversions, which helps provide more granular and timely results in a privacy safe manner and improvements to CAPI, which strengthens Snap's direct advertiser data integration, allowing advertisers to measure conversions from multiple sources. Launched in 2018, CAPI also provides advertisers with more sophisticated incremental measurement solutions such as conversion lift. For example, sports betting company, DraftKings, ran a conversion lift study in the 2 weeks leading up to the Super Bowl across several established sports book states and observed a 10.8% lift in app installs and a 188% lift in first-time deposits for male 21 plus, outpacing their install and deposit goals. As we continue working to drive measurable ROI for advertisers of all sizes, improving the efficiency of our offering and lowering the effort it takes to utilize our platform is a major focus. By lowering the cost and decreasing the time to create personalized ads, we can improve ROI by reducing the investment it takes to achieve a given return. One notable example is our progress with Dynamic Ads. By dynamically building ads for product catalogs, we are able to greatly expand the set of ads that are created. Dynamic Ads can update automatically as new products are entered into the catalog remaining up-to-date and driving ROI. As a result, revenue from Dynamic Ads more than tripled year-over-year. In addition to Dynamic Ads, we are also increasing the automation of our Ad Suite through multi-format ad delivery, which allows our systems to optimize across formats to achieve the best ROI for our advertisers in the most relevant ads for our community. These features reduce setup time, increase delivery efficiency and expand advertiser's addressable audience. We are seeing strong adoption of our automated offerings and we will prioritize these efforts in the year ahead. We continue to add deep domain expertise with our verticalized sales strategy, allowing us to effectively serve advertisers of all types and sizes. Our work with agency and advertising partners over the past year has resulted in upfront commitments for 2022 that are more than 60% higher than the total upfront commitments made in 2021. We view upfront commitments as a signal of strong confidence from agency and advertising partners as we become a part of their always-on performance-oriented advertising strategy. While the majority of our revenue today is generated from video ads, we believe we are still early in terms of realizing the full monetization potential of our content platform. Today, we comprise less than 2% of the $210 billion U.S. digital ad market and less than 1% of the $520 billion global digital ad market, while reaching nearly half of U.S. smartphone users and more than 75% of 13 to 34 year olds in over 20 countries. In addition, mobile advertising is growing faster than desktop advertising, video advertising is growing faster than non-video advertising and self-serve advertising is expected to make up 90% of all digital display ad spend in 2022. These trends are favorable for our strategy and we believe our video advertising business has the potential to deliver robust top line growth. Our unique and innovative AR lenses give our team a huge opportunity to attract advertisers across multiple verticals. In the past, larger brands use augmented reality for brand moments to drive awareness and reach through expensive one-day takeover lenses. Today, both brand and performance-oriented advertisers are utilizing augmented reality to drive significant and measurable business results. We are also adding more tools to help our advertising partners find customers and build their businesses on Snapchat. We launched our first SNAP AR certification on Snap Focus called Augmented Reality Strategies for Advertisers. This five-part learning pathway offers hands-on education and real life examples to help advertisers gain a deeper understanding of how AR is an essential tool for business and marketing objectives. We continue to invest in Arcadia, our global creative studio for branded augmented reality experiences. The team has been hard at work creating, managing and launching several experiences. Most recently, a Verizon 5G connected Snapchat Lens for the big game in our hometown of L.A., letting Snapchatters team up and battle with other groups to take control of a giant virtual airship hovering above the field. Arcadia also created a 5G AR lens in partnership with Verizon and Cirque du Soleil that transports the renowned O performance in Las Vegas to the palm of a Snapchatters hand. We have a notable acceleration in the number of advertisers leveraging our self-service tools for AR with over 70% of AR revenue now delivered via our self-serve ad platform. We recently brought our GBB pixel purchase optimization to AR and we are also investing in additional features for ad manager to make it easier for advertisers to create, manage and deploy their AR experiences. Following the launch of First Commercial in October 2020, we recently launched First Lens, which enables advertisers to reserve the first sponsored lens impression of Snapchatter seasonal lens carousel. First Lens offers more operational ease, because bookings are made through ads manager and it simultaneously improves the Snapchatter experience by surfacing the First Lens based on relevance. A top priority for AR is reducing the barrier to creation and helping brands understand the importance of AR experiences and the value they can drive. While we are still in the early stages of AR advertiser adoption, we are already making solid progress and investing to build the AR ecosystem. For example, Nike recently launched its Nike By You Sneaker customization lens in order to drive increased engagement with its Nike app and generate membership sign-ups. The multi-cell campaign resulted in an increase in sign-ups, especially among 13 to 17 year olds, a key demographic for Nike's program. After the success of the AR campaign in the U.S., Nike has scaled its lens campaign to additional regions internationally. These results are emblematic of a larger shift we're seeing with AR transforming e-commerce by increasing conversion rates. We believe that virtual try-on represents a massive opportunity to improve the way our community shops and experiences new products. Businesses are benefiting from creating their own public profile, which offers a free permanent home on Snapchat, where they can showcase compelling AR experiences and share shoppable products directly within the app. Online retail platform GOAT recently created a profile and uploaded two AR shoe try-on lenses. In the first week alone, they sought over 1 million plays, encouraging GOAT to further invest in their Snapchat presence. We are seeing higher retention for advertisers who have activated their public profile, a promising early indication than an organic presence on Snapchat is meaningful for advertiser return on ad spend. Lastly, when brands use a portfolio approach of combining sponsored AR lenses with Snap Ads, they are able to drive higher ROI and lower cost per outcome. For example, Electronic Arts ran a campaign for its Madden NFL \u201822 video game franchise, which included Commercial, Snap Ads, Lenses, Filters and Story Ads, where each of these products saw a significant lift in higher and lower funnel metrics. For Snapchatters that we're exposed to all three ad products, we saw even higher lift. This is why we are so excited about multi-format delivery, which enables these types of campaigns with greater ease. While the macro operating environment remains challenging and difficult to predict, we continue to invest in product innovation to help advertising partners scale, build strong relationships with advertisers across verticals and improve our targeting and measurement capabilities for businesses. Based on the size of our audience, there are high levels of engagement across our service and our overall opportunity in the growing digital advertising market, we believe we are well positioned to drive business results for advertisers over the long-term. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Derek. Hi, Ross, thank you for the question. So just to be specific around finger printing, for opt-out users, we do not meaningfully identify any user, who's opted out of tracking, and we do not fingerprint. There is no personally identifiable information that is directly linked to the customer. But given the platform changes, we have experienced signal loss, including IDSA and some IP addresses, and we expect that trend to continue. But if we take a step back, there are two different types of users. There is the opt-in ones and the opt-out users as well. For the opt-out users, we have deterministic measurement solutions that allow us to definitively match the conversion that's taken place, and that forms the basis of our measurement. Our privacy preserving measurement solutions, though, are built to adapt to signal loss like this which is a combination of opt-in user data and models estimated conversions to provide advertisers with a fidelity that they need to make decisions to grow their business. These changes, though, are \u2013 they are long. They take time. They put a serious onus on advertisers to adapt and reset their advertising campaigns across not just Snap, but all platforms. We empathize with them. We are working with them through these changes, and we expect to continue to do that with relentless focus on delivering ROI. I can take the second part of the question. So, you have mentioned that we have talked about financial services and streaming being particularly strong categories. We believe that, that is true largely because their success isn't predicated on external factors, like supply chain as much or labor shortages or labor disruptions and these kinds of things. So, let me unpack that a little bit more for you. Globally when we take a look at just entertainment more broadly, you are starting to look at an ecosystem where things are being released in the theater and then also on streaming, creating two separate and distinct marketing budgets, from each of the studios that used to have on either theatrical only or during the pandemic, streaming only. And so that opens up a wide variety of budgets for it globally, as a lot of these movies like we saw with the Batman and the Spider Man films, are coming back to theaters and drove the snapshot generation certainly is interested in them. And then when it comes to the financial services, you mentioned traditional category, that is true with financial services that even more broadly, when you come \u2013 when it comes to things like apps for financial services and these kinds of things. Despite the overall conditions regarding app downloads, when it comes to platform changes in general, those are picking up steam as well. So, we are seeing all of those trends globally, and we think we are going to continue to see those trends globally and are continuing to invest in those categories, and we are really excited about it. Yes. As you heard from Evan earlier in that call, we are extremely excited about the long-term opportunity that AR and AR advertising have for our business. We see AR as a consumer-centric shift to our community in shopping and experiencing new products. When you look at things like virtual trial that are being utilized by our community, people are really wanting to visualize how things look on them, not just on a website or on a model or something like that, and AR provides them that opportunity. In general, we have 250 million people engaging with AR every single day. And when you start to see consumer trends lead like that, it's really just a matter of time until advertising dollars follow, although that will continue to take time and work and effort. So, we believe it's our biggest opportunity for the long-term. We are really excited about it. And as brands are starting to build their always on AR strategies, it's even more important. We continue to invest heavily in building the tools to make that easier for them. Making it easier to create AR, to manage AR, and deploy the AR experiences, and then give them places like Public Profiles for those AR experiences to live evergreen. You start to see businesses, we mentioned last quarter like MAC and Ulta, makeup brands that are already finding incredible success by leveraging our Lens web builder tool. And we know that, that AR as a utility is going to be something that's incredibly important for businesses going forward. We talked about Nike in the prepared remarks as well. We believe that AR represents this shift, as I mentioned, which I think is really important. And then it will help to increase conversion for retailers, which is really important as well. We are getting the products into the proverbial hands of the customers and then converting that into a sale, hopefully reducing returns, impacting a lot of really great metrics from the retailer side. And we believe that this shift towards e-commerce is a long-term secular shift. So, the way that \u2013 any way that we can help improve conversions and/or the shopping experience for the Snapchat community, we are all in and couldn't be more excited about the AR advertising opportunity ahead of us. Yes. Hi Maria, I can take that one. This is Jeremi. Thank you for the question. So, I want to take a step back here and talk about measurement and optimization, which is an ongoing process. As you have probably heard me say in each of the last calls, this has been our relentless focus and our priorities since we launched our performance-driven self-serve ad platform. We have been constantly working to improve ROI for advertisers with new products, new solutions, better targeting, better optimization, and better measurement. And this is something that will continue. The reality is that our work here is truly never done. We are again, relentlessly focused on ensuring that this measurement and optimization continues to deliver the best ROI for advertisers. We know that when we do deliver that ROI, it's the most retentive that we \u2013 behavior that we can do to make sure that we get more advertisers on the platform that we develop a reputation for being a performance platform and, therefore, attract more advertisers. We have more than not only quality, but quantity of advertisements to show to our community. So, they get more relevant ads. It performs better, and so the flywheel continues. We are pleased with the progress that we are making. Prior to the invasion of Ukraine, our direct response business was growing at nearly 50% year-over-year and the full quarter was 43% year-over-year. But when you talk about progress, it's a three-step journey. So first, we need to enable the solution, which makes it possible to use these tools. Then we have to \u2013 then advertisers have to actively utilize them. And then the third step in that journey is to build trust and confidence in those solutions. The first-party solutions have been enabled for advertisers that represent 90% of our VR revenue. And then lastly, I just realized that earlier \u2013 in an earlier answer, I flipped the opt-in and opt-out information. So, I just wanted to clarify one of my earlier answers, which is that we have deterministic solutions for opt-out users. I meant to say opt-in, but hopefully that helps to clarify my earlier remarks, and thank you for the question."

            "name": "Evan Spiegel",
            "content": "Thank you all so much for joining us. The first quarter of 2022 proved more challenging than we had expected and our team was able to make significant progress against our goals despite the increased volatility in the operating environment. Our community grew 18% year-over-year to 332 million daily active users and revenue grew 38% year-over-year to $1.06 billion. This resulted in adjusted EBITDA of $64 million and free cash flow of $106 million, marking our third quarter of positive free cash flow. While we are pleased with our progress, given the macroeconomic environment, we also recognize that we have a significant amount of work to do to realize our long-term opportunity and we believe we are well positioned to invest through the turbulence. A great deal of our focus has been supporting our team members located in Ukraine and helping our Ukrainian colleagues. The war in Ukraine is heartbreaking for all of us, especially because Ukraine is the birthplace of Looksery, a company that laid the foundation for Snap's augmented reality platform. As we look forward to our Snap Partner Summit on April 28, where we will celebrate our partners and launch new products, our thoughts and prayers are with our Ukrainian team members and their families, not only because of these horrible circumstances, but because they have made so many of our innovations possible. We have remained focused on expanding our product offering and deepening engagement with our global community, which grew by 13 million daily active users in the quarter. The future of our business depends on the engagement of our community and we are pleased to see elevated growth rates in the rest of world region, where we added 10 million daily active users in the quarter. This rest of world growth follows our investments in building out the team and operations necessary to accelerate our growth in geographies where our community has demonstrated a clear product market fit with Snapchat as well as our efforts to localize our product offering and improve application performance across a wide range of devices. Our community in North America and Europe continued to grow and these geographies represent our largest monetization opportunities in the near and medium term. We believe that reinventing the camera represents our greatest opportunity to improve the way people live and communicate. What began as an application for visual communication has evolved into a leading augmented reality platform, where creators are building unique and innovative AR experiences in Lens Studio and distributing them on Snapchat and in their own applications using Camera Kit. Over 250 million Snapchatters engage with augmented reality everyday on average across a variety of use cases, including entertainment, fashion and education. Over 250,000 creators have built more than 2.5 million lenses and Snapchatters played with lenses created by our community more than twice as much this quarter when compared to Q1 2021. We recently launched our ASL Alphabet Lens, a first-of-its-kind AR experience that inspires Snapchatters to learn American Sign Language through the Snapchat Camera. The ASL Alphabet Lens uses advanced hand tracking to recognize hand poses and gestures, providing feedback as people practice communicating with sign language. We also launched Custom Landmarkers in Lens Studio, helping creators to build location-based lenses for local places they care about, from statues to storefronts, to tell richer stories about their communities through AR. In partnership with Tukwini Mandela and Black Cultural Archives, we released our Hidden Black Stories' local lens, transforming London's Trafalgar Square into an AR experience that showcases key moments, figures and stories from Black British history. In an effort to educate our community on the power of AR, we announced a new augmented reality creator program in India powered by Lens Studio. The program will include an online developer course and a series of challenges that aim to empower developers and local creators across the country. In celebration of International Women's Day, we launched an AR Lensathon consisting of three workshops across Southeast Asia to encourage the participation of young women in new digital fields like augmented reality. We believe that augmented reality belongs everywhere, not just on Snapchat. We built Camera Kit to enable our partners to leverage our augmented reality platform in their own websites and applications. Through Camera Kit, we can help grow the ecosystem of AR developers and help businesses understand the immense potential of AR. We are excited by the growing demand from businesses, who want to bring Snap's AR capabilities into their own apps and websites. For example, Zoog, a storytelling app for families, integrated Camera Kit to help people bond by sharing stories while using lenses to resemble storybook characters. We continue to make meaningful progress overlaying computing on the world through Spectacles, our augmented reality glasses. Hundreds of creators are developing AR lenses for Spectacles, building new immersive and interactive experiences like reimagining a restaurant menu in three dimensions or enhancing a workout routine. We have continued to make software improvements and offer new capabilities for developers, including a new voice ML template in Lens Studio, which enables creators to build voice-enabled experiences without scripting and Lens Studio streaming mode, which helps creators develop lenses with hand tracking from a first person perspective. With our powerful developer tools in Lens Studio and distribution through Snapchat, Camera Kit and Spectacles, we have created a compelling platform for creators to build and share augmented reality experiences, reaching hundreds of millions of people and exploring the next generation of computing. We continue to provide value for our growing community through our diverse content offerings, which include our two content platforms, Stories and Spotlight. Our Stories platform enables Snapchatters to share snaps with their friends in narrative form via friend stories and watch content from professional publishers and influencers in Discover. Spotlight is our newest content platform for showcasing the most entertaining snaps created by our community. In Q1, overall time spent watching content globally grew on a year-over-year basis driven primarily by growth in time spent with content in Discover and Spotlight. We continue to see growth in viewership of content on Discover, which has become a destination for credible and entertaining content for our community. For example, total daily time spent by Snapchatters 25 and older, engaging with shows and publisher content on Discover, increased by more than 25% year-over-year. We expanded our international content offerings by partnering with News UK, TF1 and Le Monde in France and MBC and Al Arabiya in the Middle East. Snap Originals represent another important element of our strategy to improve the diversity of available content on Discover. Over 10 million viewers have watched Breakwater, our new Snap Original about the dystopian future caused by climate change that featured episodic AR lenses in partnership with Verizon, helping Snapchatters to immerse themselves in the show. Our content partners continue to find success on our platform with 6 Discover partners reaching over 100 million global viewers in Q1. We are also investing in new tools and capabilities to better serve our content partners and to help them reach new audiences on Snapchat. We recently announced Dynamic stories and new Discover format that allows publishers to automatically create stories based on news they publish online to help Snapchatters learn about the world as it happens. Early partners include GQ, Vogue, CNN, ESPN and The Wall Street Journal. We are very excited about the long-term potential of Spotlight. While still early in its growth and evolution, we are pleased with the engagement we are seeing with total time spent growing 230% year-over-year. Over the last several months, we have focused on building the tools and infrastructure to help creators of all kinds thrive on Spotlight and we observed a 3.5x increase in the number of Spotlight submissions using our AR lenses or Creative Tools compared with Q1 2021. Spotlight offers opportunities for creators to improve discoverability and get more reach with their snaps. We continue to focus on the relationship between Stories and Spotlight where creators can use Spotlight to start building an audience and deepen their relationship with that audience through their stories. Today, there are many different ways for creators to grow an audience and build a business on Snapchat. Creators can open shops to sell merchandise, join our creator marketplace, receive virtual gifts from fans and monetize their content via our recently announced mid-roll ads in Stories. We continue to innovate on our map to bring utility and value to our community and partners. As Snapchatters are able to move about the world again, we are seeing upticks in engagement on the Map. While still very early, we are encouraged to see that Snapchatters open places from the Map more than twice as often this quarter when compared to Q1 2021. We also added a new way to help Snapchatters discover live events with the launch of our Ticketmaster layer. Snapchatters can now browse Ticketmaster's upcoming events on the Map based on what is happening nearby. We see incredible potential for innovation across our communications platform, which brings enormous value to our community by connecting people with their close friends and family. In addition to adding several new chat features, including Chat Replies, Bitmoji reactions and poll stickers, it's also where our community can launch Games and Minis, two platforms built to reimagine shared experiences with friends. We were pleased to see returning gaming partners, Funday Factory and Voodoo launch new game titles in Q1. Our gaming partners are finding success growing their businesses with more than one-third of our current gaming partners having made over $1 million in revenue. Minis represent a new platform for social experiences. We have seen recent momentum with Givingli's second Mini Send Gifts where Snapchatters can send gift cards to friends. Discover partner, Wave Sports and Entertainment, launched the Gym Heroes Mini, a social fitness experience on Snapchat that offers original daily fitness challenges and full workouts curated by fitness experts. The Mini is designed for Snapchatters to challenge their friends and collaborating groups toward their workout goals. We are so excited about the growth of our community and the evolution of our service and we can't wait to share more at our Snap Partner Summit next week on April 28. We will meet the challenges of the current operating environment by prioritizing the needs of our community and partners, who are essential to our success and we will continue to invest against our enormous opportunity in augmented reality as we work to accelerate our roadmap and deliver against our long-term plans for computing overlaid on the world. I will now turn it over to Jeremi to discuss more about our business. Hi Rich. Thanks so much for the question. And I always love to talk about the long-term. So, we are really excited about the Map opportunity, especially because our Map represents a totally different way to explore the world. Maps historically have been built for transportation to help people get from A to B. And our map is really designed to see what your friends are up to. To answer the question, where is somebody, when are they going to be home, what are my friends doing and of course, to help people explore the world through near real-time content on our Map around the world and now with places to learn more about all sorts of interesting popular and trending places around them. We are so excited that we just recently rolled out a new Ticketmaster layer that also helps people see upcoming events at venues nearby and even share those with friends and buy tickets. So, the way that our Map is transforming the way that our community is understanding the world around them and connecting with friends is super exciting and a huge opportunity over the long-term. And of course, we love the role that Bitmoji plays in all this and our action mojis on the Map that show when people are flying or driving. So, you can see where your friend is in transit. So, definitely a big and exciting opportunity for us long-term. I think as it pertains to the way that businesses participate on the Map, a lot of our recent focus has been around places. So, bringing businesses onto the Map, allowing chains, for example, to claim their businesses and actually, now we are testing just at the very, very early stages of testing folks running advertising against those places to drive people to locations nearby. So, that will be an interesting experiment. And then of course, our layers are also a way that businesses can interact with the Snap Map, and that will be an exciting place for us to invest going forward. Yes. So, on the user growth side, certainly a ton of opportunity around the world, especially in the rest of world region and in Europe. And what we are really excited about is this value that Snapchat has in connecting close friends and family through visual communication just continues to be really strong. People love sharing what they are up to visually. It's much more expressive. It's obviously much faster than text messaging. And so as we have done a lot of this work to localize our application to improve its performance, we are really unlocking that core product value for our community around the world. So, lots of great progress there. Hard to call out one country, in particular. Certainly, India has been a great success story for us. But that's been a big focus of ours, and we have now really organized our teams in our processes around scaling that growth around the world. Yes. I think what we are most excited about, and of course, I will have to wait for our Partners Summit next week for specifics, but what we are most excited about is really this intersection between augmented reality and commerce. So, what we found as we have been growing our AR business over the years, that people use all sorts of accessories and fashion items to express themselves through augmented reality. And we found that by partnering with retailers and fashion brands, that if we can actually use their real products in augmented reality, it dramatically improves conversion for those businesses, and so it can lead to higher sales. And we have also done some work on fit and size to try and help people find the right size, which we found can really improve the rate of returns for merchants as well. And so we have the strategy really to use augmented reality to both improve the top and bottom line for retailers and, of course, radically improve the customer experience. I mean the idea that you can try on all these different looks and styles without ever changing your clothes is really transformational. I am really hoping it will make an impact in our household for sure. So, that I think has been a really exciting place for us to invest, and you have to wait until next week for the specifics. Hey Mark, thanks so much for the question. Yes, we have definitely begun testing advertising in Spotlight, although that testing is still quite limited. We have rolled out mid-roll ads in stories for creators. And we have actually seen something, a really exciting sort of phenomenon take off on Snapchat, where Creators are using Spotlight and posting videos to Spotlight to try to get more distribution and attract more subscribers to their story, and then they posted their story to build a deeper relationship with their subscribers and share revenue with us on mid-roll advertising inserted within that story. So, I think this is going to be another great way that we can really serve creators and continue to deepen the content experience on Snapchat. And as we mentioned, we are really excited about the momentum and growth of Spotlight and all the incredible original content that's being created by our community. So, we will continue to be investing there and of course, testing advertising on Spotlight, because we think it's going to be a great place for advertisers. Unfortunately, the Spotlight format is full-screen vertical video, which is a format that we pioneered and that advertisers all over the world have adopted. So, it does make it quite seamless to transfer those advertisements over to the Spotlight platform."

Adjusted gross margins expanded 1 percentage point quarter-over-quarter. Adjusted operating expenses declined by 2% year-over-year. And we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $159 million and free cash flow of $111 million in Q4. 2023 was a pivotal year for Snap as we focused relentlessly on adding value to our communities while evolving our business for long-term growth. Last year, we made transformative changes to our business by shifting to a more customer-centric approach, investing heavily in our ML platform to drive improved performance for our advertising partners and better leveraging privacy-safe signals for ranking and optimization. We also transformed our go-to-market efforts with new regional leadership and a renewed focus on customer-oriented advertising solutions. We began 2024 with a focus on 3 initiatives that we believe are essential for Snapchat's long-term success. First, we are continuing to evolve our machine learning models to drive more ad interactions across our platform. Second, we are working to unify the content experience across Spotlight and Stories to improve the user experience and deepen engagement. Lastly, we are shifting more of our focus towards user growth and deepening engagement in our most highly monetizable geographies, including North America and Europe. We believe that focusing on these initiatives will help us to increase daily active usage of Snapchat, deepen content engagement, improve performance for advertisers and ultimately accelerate revenue growth and drive increased free cash flow. In order to best position our business to execute on these priorities and to ensure we have the capacity to invest incrementally to support our growth over time, we have made the difficult decision to restructure our team while continuing our investments in our highest priorities, including improved top line growth. We will reduce layers of management and concentrate our team members in major hub locations to support in-person collaboration, resulting in a reduction in our full-time workforce of approximately 10% in Q1 of 2024. The team members impacted by these changes are kind, smart and creative colleagues, who have been important contributors to our business during this challenging time and we are committed to supporting them in their transition. Thank you. And with that, we will begin our Q&A session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays.\nRoss Sandler: Evan, question on the DR side of the ad business. So growth was comparable at 3% for the fourth quarter, about the same as the third quarter. So I guess, why aren't we seeing more progress in getting that growth rate up to the levels of the broader digital ad industry? Like what's holding us back right now? And then, your guidance for 1Q assumes that the trends accelerate upwards to low double digits to mid-teens, depending on the range. So what kind of acceleration are you seeing in DR thus far in 1Q? And what does that mean for the rest of 2024?\nEvan Spiegel: Thanks, Ross. We're really excited about the progress we're seeing, especially in our lower funnel business and with small- and medium-sized advertisers. Purchase-related conversions grew 90% year-over-year in Q4. And we saw small- and medium-sized -- a number of small and medium-sized advertisers grow 20% year-over-year. We really think this reflects more resilient revenue as well because as we've navigated some of these external challenges over the last couple of years, we found that those lower funnel dollars are just more resilient. I think looking ahead at Q1, the top end of the guidance range reflects a 10-point acceleration. So we are making progress here. Obviously, we wish we were moving faster but we're working as hard as we can and pleased by what we're seeing in the Direct Response business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\nDoug Anmuth: Evan, you've talked a little bit about introducing a universal fee on the platform, perhaps unifying Stories and Spotlight content. Can you just talk about the opportunity here and how you could do this in a privacy- and brand-safe manner? And then, what it would mean for ad inventory and perhaps revenue?\nEvan Spiegel: Yes. When we set out to build Spotlight, we actually built it on a totally separate stack, so meaning the ranking was separate stack, the inventory was separate from our Stories inventory and the user experience itself as well was different. We've really seen a lot of opportunity in bringing some of those improvements to Stories. Our Stories inventory is more constrained than Spotlight, for example. It doesn't leverage some of the ranking improvements and model improvements we've made on Spotlight. And so we think unifying the Stories and Spotlight experience will bring a lot of the benefits we've seen on the Spotlight side in terms of personalization and the user experience to Stories as well. So we're definitely excited about that. A lot of the sort of under-the-hood work is well underway and we have some tests rolling out throughout the year that should get us closer to that unified experience. In terms of brand safety, we just completed a third-party audit on brand safety. I think we're close to 99% of brand-safe content on Spotlight and close to 100% actually in terms of creator content, Snap Stars and the like. So I think one of the really unique things about Snapchat is that advertisers can get a brand-safe experience without paying a premium for it, like they have to do on other platforms, to avoid harmful content. So I do think we'll be able to continue to extend those benefits to advertisers in this unified experience. And our very high levels of brand safety, I think, are a real differentiator for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.\nEric Sheridan: Evan, maybe if I could stick with the big-picture themes that you introduced in your introductory remarks. When you look across the competitive landscape of sort of social media, media consumption and the potential for rising utility around apps like yourself, how do you identify what you see as sort of the opportunity set and the potential challenges you're trying to navigate around to sort of reposition the business for growth in users, engagement and monetization over the long term?\nEvan Spiegel: Yes. Thanks for the question. As we've designed Snapchat and really architected the product, we thought about building it around some of the core ways that people use their smartphones. So things like talking with friends, taking pictures, watching content, these are the things that people do most often and really engage with the most on their phones. And I think, as we look at Snapchat, one of our biggest opportunities is actually the way the relationship between these different services that's been a strategic advantage for us. If you think about growth of our Content business, what we've seen is we can grow the top of funnel as friends share content with each other, that brings more people into our content experience. Or when we launched Spotlight, we leveraged the fact that so many people use our camera every day to create videos that we could generate a lot of inventory for our Spotlight product very, very quickly. So I think this relationship between our camera, our messaging service and of course, our content platform is really a key strategic advantage for us. And as we continue to focus on helping close friends and family stay in touch and communicate visually with one another, I think there's a lot more opportunity for us ahead.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Shmulik with Bernstein.\nMark Shmulik: I noticed in the investor letter that there's -- one of the priorities is to focus on North America and Europe, growing users and deepening engagement. We saw a little bit of softness in North America DAU. Can you just share a little color as to why and perhaps below the surface, kind of some of the changes you're doing as you think about focusing on growing engagement in these markets?\nEvan Spiegel: Yes. Thanks for the question. As we look at North America, in the fourth quarter, that decline was mostly an artifact of rounding. We're not expecting a further decline in North America in Q1. I do think overall, though, there is an opportunity for us to invest more in growth in North America and Europe. Over the past 5 to 7 years, we've really focused on our Android product and growth in emerging markets. That's really about attracting a large volume of new users. I think in places like North America and Europe, we can do a better job on iOS and really on resurrecting people who tried Snapchat or who aren't coming into the service as often or when they come back to receive a message from their friends, helping them onboard to our other different features. So that's going to be an increasing focus for us and we'll be investing more there over the coming years. We're kind of currently just really sizing that opportunity and really understanding it. We obviously reach a very large number, I think, more than 75%, of 13 to 34-year olds in over 20 countries. But I do think there is some headroom to continue to grow our business in Europe and North America in terms of users.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rich Greenfield with LightShed Partners.\nRich Greenfield: Evan, I guess, this all kind of comes down to the investor questions are tied to scale. And the Snap's smaller scale relative to Meta, is that just sort of a fundamental long-term issue? Because I think people are looking at Meta growing 30% at a tremendous underlying scale and certainly spending very, very aggressively on AI and ML. And is that the limiting factor on your growth? I mean 10 to 15, as you noted, is obviously a pretty nice acceleration from where you were this quarter at 5. But backing out subscription years probably, you could, at the bottom end, still grow below 10% ad only. So just as we think about sort of 2024, is Q1 the low point? Meaning, is there a dramatic acceleration that you see possible throughout the whole year, as you lean into DR and the ML investments pay off? Or are you just sort of fundamentally disadvantaged? I think that's what investors, who are obviously seeing what's happened to the stock overnight, are trying to struggle with and understand.\nEvan Spiegel: Yes. Thanks, Rich. I think, as a platform that serves over 800 million people around the world, we're certainly one of the largest Internet services. We aren't as large as some players but I think there's enormous opportunity for us to continue to grow business. I think, as you look at sort of the overall revenue resilience, one of the things we've really focused on in the last couple of years is pivoting to lower funnel objectives for advertising partners and especially small- and medium-sized businesses. We historically had more of a brand-focused advertising business. And it's taken quite a lot of work and investment. We're certainly trying to play catch-up here on the Direct Response side but we are seeing evidence that, that's working. So I think as we look at our 7-0 product, for example, in the way that that's really driving purchases for advertisers, that tells me that as we apply those learnings to other categories like apps, for example, that we'll be able to see more momentum and progress there. So it certainly has been a difficult transition from a more brand-oriented business to Direct Response but we are making a lot of progress. And when I look at the work we've done just on the modeling side and the scale of our models now and our ability to utilize pressure more real-time signals in a privacy-safe way across our platform, I do think we're making significant progress. And we're optimistic that we can continue to accelerate.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Heaney with Jefferies.\nJames Heaney: Derek, can you just give a little bit more detail about what you're seeing so far in Q1, whether that's January or early February? The guide implies a pretty decent acceleration in revenue growth. So just curious, what's specifically giving you that confidence to get back into the mid-teens at the high point?\nDerek Andersen: Hey, it's Derek. Thanks for the question. I think at a very high level, we're off to a good start. It's early in the quarter, we're only about a month in but we're off to a good start. And as Evan said, we've made a lot of progress with the ad platform in the trailing year. And I think what we're really looking for here is sort of four high-level things: One is significant improvement to the ad platform fundamentally, then improvements to our go-to-market, then delivering better rollout to advertisers and then that translating into budgets, moving over and advertisers growing. And then, we made a lot of fundamental improvements to the ad platform and our go-to-market last year. Evan touched on a lot of that and how that started showing up in improved ROAS [ph] in Q4, whether that was the more than 90% growth in purchase-related conversions in Q4 and also early input signs in advertiser growth, with the more than 20% growth in small- and medium-sized customers in Q4. So you're seeing that those fundamental improvements to the platform and our go-to-market efforts starting to translate into results for advertisers and then us seeing that in some of our outputs with a good start here and then reflected in the guide that we've provided. So we're definitely seeing progress there and pleased with the start that we're off to. And that's reflected in the guide. And as you noted at the high end of the guide, we'd be looking at a 10 percentage point acceleration in the year-over-year growth rate which would certainly be good progress in a single quarter and we look to build from there. So with the potential question, hopefully, you're seeing the progress that we are.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Justin Post with Bank of America.\nJustin Post: Great. Maybe one for Evan. Just on the cost side, a pretty big change you made in January or planned in January but made recently. Can you talk about the motivation for that? And then, Derek, maybe explain when the benefit of that will hit, I'm assuming 2Q but maybe you could outline how much cost savings and when we'll see it hit the model?\nEvan Spiegel: Yes. Thanks for the question. It's always painful and difficult to make these sorts of changes with our team. We're really motivated by trying to move faster. Last year, towards the end of the year, we made a rather large change to our product team and restructured the team to just drive a lot more accountability and focus. And in doing so, we removed a number of layers of management. We saw the impact that, that had just in terms of the clarity and focus and the ability for people to collaborate and work together. And I think as well, we're seeing a lot of benefits from getting folks together in the office and the sort of problem solving and creativity that comes out of that. So I think putting a real focus on reducing hierarchy and really an emphasis on bringing people together to solve problems has made a big difference for the business recently. And I think these changes will allow us to do more of that.\nDerek Andersen: On the cost structure side, I think a few things to walk through here, just looking at their cost structure generally. One, we're trying to make sure that we've got a really clear path to be generating meaningful adjusted EBITDA and positive free cash flow. And that's really defining our investment levels and then we're prioritizing within that. As I look forward to Q1, number one, we've seen a big increase in infrastructure costs in 2023, on the order of magnitude of about $100 million of quarterly run rate of higher infrastructure costs and that's led to the rather significant increases in improper DAU [ph]. You saw that start to slow down as we went through the back half of 2023 and into Q4 of 2023 in terms of the sequential increase in the infrastructure for DAU and really look for that to continue to slow down or level off here as we move into Q1. And that's going to give us the opportunity to make progress against our medium- and long-term margin targets, given infrastructure is the biggest element of the cost of revenue side of things. As I look down to the OpEx side, just a couple of things to note. One, we had a really good outcome on Q4 adjusted EBITDA. Part of that was being at the higher end of our internal range we shared with you on revenue but part of that was about better flow-through. And we had lower-than-expected marketing costs, for example, in Q4. And timing-wise, you're going to see some of those marketing costs in Q1 this year with the campaign that we've kicked off. And so you're seeing a little bit of that as a onetime item flowing through the Q1 costs that, of course, are impacting the adjusted EBITDA guide in Q1. From an ongoing cost structure perspective, though, to your question, yes, we made a very difficult decision earlier this week to restructure our team that impacted about 10% of the team. So about 60% or 2/3 of our OpEx is people or people related, so we would expect to see that help us on the OpEx side. But you probably will not expect to see that really fully reflected in the cost structure until Q2 and beyond. In Q2, we'll be going through that transition and we'll actually be incurring between $55 million and $75 million of restructuring costs in -- largely in Q1, that will put downward pressure on net income in the quarter. So a lot of the cost structure benefits that you would expect to see there will show up in Q2 from an adjusted EBITDA perspective. So if you're sort of following through each of those pieces, then you've got a path here to a structure change in how to think about infrastructure and cost of revenue, where the lion's share of the increase in infrastructure costs in 2023 are best thought of as fixed. Therefore, that gives us the ability to flow through at a really good rate as we have incremental revenue growth. You saw that in Q3 and Q4, where we flowed through more than 2/3 of incremental revenue to the adjusted EBITDA line. So that's sort of an indication of how we can scale well on the gross margin line. And then from here, after restructuring on the OpEx side and getting to a good size on our overall fixed cost, cash cost structure, it's about being disciplined from here which we expect to be able to do. And the changes we make give us room to invest to support our growth is if we -- if and when we accelerate revenue. The last thing I'd just touch on here, below the adjusted EBITDA line, SBC has been a real focus for us in trying to get to a sustainable level of SBC. The restructuring changes that we made earlier this week are going to help us significantly with making progress on that. The other is that we've been talking a lot throughout 2023 about SBC being elevated as a result of Refresh grants [ph] to the team and how that flows through gap measurement of SBC. We saw that impact begin to dissipate in Q4 of '23, 24% year-over-year decline or $110 million year-over-year decline in SBC, largely driven by that impact rolling off. We'll see that further dissipate into Q1 and later this year. So really getting the cost structure in a much better place here to carve a path to profitability, sustain free cash flow and sustainable rates of SBC and dilution. So hopefully, that helps. And look, I know it's a long answer to a short question but the last thing I'd add is just on managing the SBC, it's been a real focus to get the share count right. We bought back nearly $1.2 billion of our shares over the last 18 months at prices below $10. That's really helped us here to get through this period of transition with the business. With a level of share count growth, it's more sustainable. Since IPO, we've kept that number at around 3.6% [ph] CAGR. So hopefully, you can see the discipline in the cost structure with the changes we've made and you'll see us level out at a cost structure that scales well to produce profitability and free cash flow. So thanks for the question and bearing with the long answer.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Stephen Ju with UBS.\nStephen Ju: Aside from what sounds like benefit to engagement, I think you've previously talked about how My AI has been helping you gather more intent data. So we're wondering if you can help draw the line from that as a concept to revenue benefit as you continue to underwrite the incremental cost to serve?\nEvan Spiegel: Yes. Thanks for the question. We certainly do think that, that signal can be another input into our models to help deliver more relevant and engaging advertising. We made a lot of progress on the cost-to-serve side in terms of My AI and we've been testing routing queries to different models and whatnot to help reduce cost, depending on the complexity of the query. I'd say, overall, our generative AI efforts have been much more focused on image and video models and helping people edit their Snaps or generate Snaps in new and entertaining ways and really using that as an on-ramp to Snapchat+. We're really excited that we reached more than 7 million Snapchat+ subscribers in Q4. And I do think that Snapchat+ will be a way to monetize some of these more intensive image and video offerings that we're rolling out.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore.\nMark Mahaney: Evan, you talked about unifying the content experience across Stories and Spotlight. Could you talk about the degree of difficulty in doing that? Do you find use cases are such that people just pick one -- users pick 1 or 2 -- one of those and silo off there and it's going to be hard to unify that experience? And if it is hard, how do you plan to do that? Just any more color on how you unify the content experience.\nEvan Spiegel: Yes. I'd say, overall, anytime you're asking people to change their behavior, that can be difficult. That's why we're really trying to be thoughtful about it. I think one of the most frustrating things from a user experience perspective is that the UI and navigation for Spotlight is different than the UI and navigation for Stories. So the initial steps here are really trying to unify the UI and then unify the navigation and make sure there aren't any negative secondary impacts to various parts of our business. But I think overall, as we look at the way that Spotlight has been able to drive some really significant engagement growth and really the opportunity to broaden out our inventory pool and do our ranking models in a holistic way, I think those benefits will outweigh whatever disruptions we have to navigate as we unify that user interface in navigation.\nOperator: This concludes our Q&A session, as well as Snap Incorporated Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.

            "content": "Hi, everyone and thank you all for joining us. In Q4, we continued to make progress on our core priorities of growing our community and improving depth of engagement, driving top line growth and diversifying our revenue sources and carving a path to adjusted EBITDA profitability and positive free cash flow. Monthly active users increased more than 8% year-over-year and surpassed the 800 million milestone in Q4, demonstrating progress towards our goal of 1 billion monthly active users. Daily active users reached 414 million in Q4, an increase of 10% year-over-year and we continue to deepen engagement with our content platform, with the number of viewers and total time spent watching content growing year-over-year. Revenue grew 5% year-over-year in Q4 to reach $1.361 billion as we remain focused on investing in our Direct Response business to deliver increased return on ad spend for our advertising partners. Adjusted gross margins expanded 1 percentage point quarter-over-quarter. Adjusted operating expenses declined by 2% year-over-year. And we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $159 million and free cash flow of $111 million in Q4. 2023 was a pivotal year for Snap as we focused relentlessly on adding value to our communities while evolving our business for long-term growth. Last year, we made transformative changes to our business by shifting to a more customer-centric approach, investing heavily in our ML platform to drive improved performance for our advertising partners and better leveraging privacy-safe signals for ranking and optimization. We also transformed our go-to-market efforts with new regional leadership and a renewed focus on customer-oriented advertising solutions. We began 2024 with a focus on 3 initiatives that we believe are essential for Snapchat's long-term success. First, we are continuing to evolve our machine learning models to drive more ad interactions across our platform. Second, we are working to unify the content experience across Spotlight and Stories to improve the user experience and deepen engagement. Lastly, we are shifting more of our focus towards user growth and deepening engagement in our most highly monetizable geographies, including North America and Europe. We believe that focusing on these initiatives will help us to increase daily active usage of Snapchat, deepen content engagement, improve performance for advertisers and ultimately accelerate revenue growth and drive increased free cash flow. In order to best position our business to execute on these priorities and to ensure we have the capacity to invest incrementally to support our growth over time, we have made the difficult decision to restructure our team while continuing our investments in our highest priorities, including improved top line growth. We will reduce layers of management and concentrate our team members in major hub locations to support in-person collaboration, resulting in a reduction in our full-time workforce of approximately 10% in Q1 of 2024. The team members impacted by these changes are kind, smart and creative colleagues, who have been important contributors to our business during this challenging time and we are committed to supporting them in their transition. Thank you. And with that, we will begin our Q&A session. Thanks, Ross. We're really excited about the progress we're seeing, especially in our lower funnel business and with small- and medium-sized advertisers. Purchase-related conversions grew 90% year-over-year in Q4. And we saw small- and medium-sized -- a number of small and medium-sized advertisers grow 20% year-over-year. We really think this reflects more resilient revenue as well because as we've navigated some of these external challenges over the last couple of years, we found that those lower funnel dollars are just more resilient. I think looking ahead at Q1, the top end of the guidance range reflects a 10-point acceleration. So we are making progress here. Obviously, we wish we were moving faster but we're working as hard as we can and pleased by what we're seeing in the Direct Response business. Yes. When we set out to build Spotlight, we actually built it on a totally separate stack, so meaning the ranking was separate stack, the inventory was separate from our Stories inventory and the user experience itself as well was different. We've really seen a lot of opportunity in bringing some of those improvements to Stories. Our Stories inventory is more constrained than Spotlight, for example. It doesn't leverage some of the ranking improvements and model improvements we've made on Spotlight. And so we think unifying the Stories and Spotlight experience will bring a lot of the benefits we've seen on the Spotlight side in terms of personalization and the user experience to Stories as well. So we're definitely excited about that. A lot of the sort of under-the-hood work is well underway and we have some tests rolling out throughout the year that should get us closer to that unified experience. In terms of brand safety, we just completed a third-party audit on brand safety. I think we're close to 99% of brand-safe content on Spotlight and close to 100% actually in terms of creator content, Snap Stars and the like. So I think one of the really unique things about Snapchat is that advertisers can get a brand-safe experience without paying a premium for it, like they have to do on other platforms, to avoid harmful content. So I do think we'll be able to continue to extend those benefits to advertisers in this unified experience. And our very high levels of brand safety, I think, are a real differentiator for us. Yes. Thanks for the question. As we've designed Snapchat and really architected the product, we thought about building it around some of the core ways that people use their smartphones. So things like talking with friends, taking pictures, watching content, these are the things that people do most often and really engage with the most on their phones. And I think, as we look at Snapchat, one of our biggest opportunities is actually the way the relationship between these different services that's been a strategic advantage for us. If you think about growth of our Content business, what we've seen is we can grow the top of funnel as friends share content with each other, that brings more people into our content experience. Or when we launched Spotlight, we leveraged the fact that so many people use our camera every day to create videos that we could generate a lot of inventory for our Spotlight product very, very quickly. So I think this relationship between our camera, our messaging service and of course, our content platform is really a key strategic advantage for us. And as we continue to focus on helping close friends and family stay in touch and communicate visually with one another, I think there's a lot more opportunity for us ahead. Yes. Thanks for the question. As we look at North America, in the fourth quarter, that decline was mostly an artifact of rounding. We're not expecting a further decline in North America in Q1. I do think overall, though, there is an opportunity for us to invest more in growth in North America and Europe. Over the past 5 to 7 years, we've really focused on our Android product and growth in emerging markets. That's really about attracting a large volume of new users. I think in places like North America and Europe, we can do a better job on iOS and really on resurrecting people who tried Snapchat or who aren't coming into the service as often or when they come back to receive a message from their friends, helping them onboard to our other different features. So that's going to be an increasing focus for us and we'll be investing more there over the coming years. We're kind of currently just really sizing that opportunity and really understanding it. We obviously reach a very large number, I think, more than 75%, of 13 to 34-year olds in over 20 countries. But I do think there is some headroom to continue to grow our business in Europe and North America in terms of users. Yes. Thanks, Rich. I think, as a platform that serves over 800 million people around the world, we're certainly one of the largest Internet services. We aren't as large as some players but I think there's enormous opportunity for us to continue to grow business. I think, as you look at sort of the overall revenue resilience, one of the things we've really focused on in the last couple of years is pivoting to lower funnel objectives for advertising partners and especially small- and medium-sized businesses. We historically had more of a brand-focused advertising business. And it's taken quite a lot of work and investment. We're certainly trying to play catch-up here on the Direct Response side but we are seeing evidence that, that's working. So I think as we look at our 7-0 product, for example, in the way that that's really driving purchases for advertisers, that tells me that as we apply those learnings to other categories like apps, for example, that we'll be able to see more momentum and progress there. So it certainly has been a difficult transition from a more brand-oriented business to Direct Response but we are making a lot of progress. And when I look at the work we've done just on the modeling side and the scale of our models now and our ability to utilize pressure more real-time signals in a privacy-safe way across our platform, I do think we're making significant progress. And we're optimistic that we can continue to accelerate. Yes. Thanks for the question. It's always painful and difficult to make these sorts of changes with our team. We're really motivated by trying to move faster. Last year, towards the end of the year, we made a rather large change to our product team and restructured the team to just drive a lot more accountability and focus. And in doing so, we removed a number of layers of management. We saw the impact that, that had just in terms of the clarity and focus and the ability for people to collaborate and work together. And I think as well, we're seeing a lot of benefits from getting folks together in the office and the sort of problem solving and creativity that comes out of that. So I think putting a real focus on reducing hierarchy and really an emphasis on bringing people together to solve problems has made a big difference for the business recently. And I think these changes will allow us to do more of that. Yes. Thanks for the question. We certainly do think that, that signal can be another input into our models to help deliver more relevant and engaging advertising. We made a lot of progress on the cost-to-serve side in terms of My AI and we've been testing routing queries to different models and whatnot to help reduce cost, depending on the complexity of the query. I'd say, overall, our generative AI efforts have been much more focused on image and video models and helping people edit their Snaps or generate Snaps in new and entertaining ways and really using that as an on-ramp to Snapchat+. We're really excited that we reached more than 7 million Snapchat+ subscribers in Q4. And I do think that Snapchat+ will be a way to monetize some of these more intensive image and video offerings that we're rolling out. Yes. I'd say, overall, anytime you're asking people to change their behavior, that can be difficult. That's why we're really trying to be thoughtful about it. I think one of the most frustrating things from a user experience perspective is that the UI and navigation for Spotlight is different than the UI and navigation for Stories. So the initial steps here are really trying to unify the UI and then unify the navigation and make sure there aren't any negative secondary impacts to various parts of our business. But I think overall, as we look at the way that Spotlight has been able to drive some really significant engagement growth and really the opportunity to broaden out our inventory pool and do our ranking models in a holistic way, I think those benefits will outweigh whatever disruptions we have to navigate as we unify that user interface in navigation."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Evan.\nEvan Spiegel: Hi, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. Our revenue returned to positive growth in Q3, increasing 5% year-over-year and flowing through to positive adjusted EBITDA as our reprioritized cost structure demonstrated the leverage in our business model. We are focused on improving our advertising platform to drive higher return on investment for our advertising partners, and we have evolved our go-to-market efforts to better serve our partners and drive customer success. We also made progress toward diversifying our revenue with Snapchat+ reaching more than 5 million subscribers in the quarter, resulting in Snapchat+ revenue growing more than 250% year-over-year. Our focus on visual communication between friends and family is a strategic advantage that has enabled us to build engaging and retentive products and services across our platform. Our community grew to 406 million daily active users in Q3, and we are working to further deepen content engagement by focusing on three key areas: investing in our ML models to improve content ranking and personalization across all of our content surfaces; growing our creator community and diversity of content by supporting and rewarding creators; and using content to start conversations and build relationships across our service. We continue to leverage AI technology to deliver new products and features to our community. Since launching My AI, more than 200 million people have sent more than 20 billion messages, which we believe makes My AI one of the most used AI chatbots available today. More than 250 million Snapchatters engage with AR experiences on our platform every day on average. On November 9, we will be live streaming our sixth annual Lens Fest. We're thrilled to have the opportunity to bring together the vibrant Snap AR community of developers and creators that are collaborating with us to push boundaries, redefine what's possible with augmented reality, and build businesses along the way. Given the progress we have made with our ad platform, the leadership team we have built, the work we have done to reprioritize our cost structure and the strength of our balance sheet, we believe we are well positioned to continue making progress on our top strategic priorities. As we move forward into Q4 and 2024, we remain focused on investing in our platform to sustain community growth, investing heavily in our direct-response business to deliver measurable return on ad spend, and cultivating new sources of revenue to diversify our top-line growth to build a more resilient business. I want to thank Jerry Hunter, our Chief Operating Officer, for seven years of service at Snap. Jerry has notified us of his intent to retire and will be transitioning his responsibilities by the end of the month. I am deeply grateful to Jerry for the meaningful contributions he has made over his many years at Snap. His work to improve our advertising platform, serve our community, and build a strong team has helped to lay the foundation for our future growth. Thank you. And with that, we will begin our Q&A session.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. Your 4Q revenue guide mostly implies the deceleration versus 3Q, and I think that's coming on much easier comps. I was just hoping you could provide some color on October performance, especially given the war in the Middle East. And we know that 4Q is back-end weighted, and I think the brand comps in particular get easier through the quarter. Just hoping you could talk about what's embedded there. Thank you.\nDerek Andersen: Hi, there. Doug, it's Derek speaking. I'll take that one for you. First and foremost, you're right, we had a quarter in Q3 that we're pretty pleased with on the progress we made on top-line. There's a lot that went into that. We had a number of drivers to that outcome, including the progress we've made on our direct-response ad platform. We continue to make really significant investments in the ad ranking and optimization, incorporating a much broader range of signals into the ad platform and driving much larger models. And we've also instituted a much faster pace of experimentation. All of that's leading to more precise conversion predictions, improved ROI for advertisers. And as we noted in the letter in particular, 7/0 has been a bright spot in the quarter in terms of driving Pixel Purchase behavior and the year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth that we saw in lower funnel. And I also note that part of the strength in Q3 was around brand advertising where we saw really good uptake on our Total Takeover products, including First Story that launched in the period. So, really pleased with the momentum that we saw there. And I think as you look into Q4, I think we talked about a little bit in the letter, but to share some high-level color, we believe we're on the right path for the DR platform. So, we're pleased with the continuous progress we're making there, working with our partners on making their privacy safe integrations with the platform, higher quality and more performance for them and driving performance. We're also pleased with what we're seeing on our scaled solutions for small and medium-sized businesses and what that drove out in terms of quarter-over-quarter growth in Q3 of 11% in aggregate and the DR business returning to year-over-year growth. So, we're really pleased with fundamentally what we're seeing there and what we're executing against into the new quarter. I think on the brand side in particular, coming off of the progress that we saw in Q3 with those new brand products seeing really good uptake, you're right, as we move into Q4, Q4 is a little bit different as a quarter. Historically, we've seen a little bit larger share of the revenue coming from brand products in Q4. And then two, the Q4 business being a little bit more back-end weighted than other quarters historically as well. So, both of those things sort of impacting visibility. And brand having grown at a slower rate in Q3 and being a larger share of the business in Q4 sort of brings a little bit of a mix shift headwind. And then last, the point that you raised very specifically, which is what we've seen since the onset of the war in the Middle East is we have had a number of primarily brand-oriented campaigns pause spending in the early period after the onset of the war there in the Middle East. I will say that we have seen a lot of those campaigns resume spending. And the impact to our daily run rate has reduced significantly as a result of that. But we also have seen a very small amount of incremental campaign pauses triple in more recently. And so, one of the things that we've tried to do here when we're thinking about giving forward-looking information for Q4 is number one, be transparent about what we've seen quarter-to-date on that side. And then, I think when we look back historically, for example, to what we all experienced at the onset of the war in Ukraine and the impact that that had on folks' business and the operating environment, I think we've realized that war is fundamentally unpredictable. And as a result, it would be imprudent to provide a formal guide in that kind of an environment. However, what we did do for the sake of transparency for the investment community to share our internal forecast, and that internal forecast assumes an acceleration at the top end. But we've attempted to incorporate everything that we know as of today about the impact of those pauses into the fullness of the range of revenue so that you can see that. And then, of course, that obviously flows right through to the adjusted EBITDA range as well, because we have a very high rate of flow through on those. So, I think stepping back fundamentally, we're pleased with the progress we're making on the DR business. And we're pleased, we think we're on the right path with that platform. And we're also pleased with the uptake that we saw from those new brand products in Q3 as well. So I think, the progress there is good. We just want to make sure that people are aware of that one headwind we've seen to begin the quarter. And hopefully that gives you a little bit of color on how we frame that. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ross Sandler with Barclays.\nRoss Sandler: Great. Hey, guys. So, Evan, you recently changed the leadership team in North America ad sales. And that seems like the area that's not yet caught up with the rest of the business, which is performing quite well. So, I guess, how do you feel about that change? How confident are we that North America larger accounts are going to step up and commit to more budget with Snap in 2024? And when do you expect that growth rate to kind of converge with the international business, if you can help us there? Thanks a lot.\nEvan Spiegel: Hey, Ross, thanks so much for the question. Yeah, we are making some progress in North America, the fastest growing region quarter-over-quarter, but obviously, a long way from where we'd like it to be. In general, North America has a number of large customers that are simply just more complex to work with. So, while we've made a lot of progress with some of the simpler integrations, our 7/0 optimization and whatnot for smaller advertisers, it's just taken more of a focus and more in the details work to drive customer success with larger advertisers. So, I'm pleased with the progress that we're making. We're fixing stuff every day and getting advertisers closer to hitting their KPIs, or in many cases, above their KPIs, which should translate into improved spend. So making progress there, but definitely more complex customers. And we're excited about Patrick's leadership of the team. He's got a wealth of experience to bring.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Rich Greenfield with LightShed.\nRich Greenfield: Hi, thanks for taking the question. One question and then a housekeeping. In the employee memo that leaked a couple of weeks ago, it stated a goal of 80% of your daily active users interacting with content. Trying to get a handle on how ambitious of a goal that is for 2024 as content engagement would have seemed to be a pretty critical driver of your advertising revenue potential, thinking about where ads are embedded. I don't have any idea really where you are in terms of how many DAUs touch content today and what would be driving the growth to 80% of overall DAU. So, any color you can give us on that goal and where you are today and changes would be great. And then two, just on the -- also in that memo, you mentioned a 20% revenue growth goal for 2024. Evan, is that really hard to do? Like, what's your confidence goal on getting 20% growth next year? Thanks.\nEvan Spiegel: Thanks, Rich. Yeah, that's an internal memo really designed to motivate and inspire the team around what's possible. When it comes to the content penetration, that's really going to be driven by emerging countries where, in some cases, our growth there is earlier in its cycle and so folks are just ramping up with our communications products and have yet to really transition to the content-focused products. So, when we talk about 80% of DAU, in aggregate, what we're really trying to accomplish is breadth of content engagement in some of the emerging countries and then really depth of engagement in the more developed countries where we do have a very high rate of DAUs engaging with content already. So that's really how that strategy -- how we're thinking about the content strategy. The 20% revenue, that's really about making more progress in terms of customer success, especially with the lower funnel. We are excited about the progress that we're seeing. So, we're hoping we can just keep our heads down and keep making more progress there.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Shmulik with Bernstein. You may proceed.\nMark Shmulik: Yes, thanks for taking the question. Evan, I'd love to hear just a little bit more color on My AI, like around usage. Are folks using this daily? What are they really asking their AI companions? And then, is there any real commercial intent that you're seeing there? And kind of like a sub follow-up, any color you could share on how that Microsoft partnership is going there would be fantastic. Thanks.\nEvan Spiegel: Yeah. We're excited about the progress we're seeing with My AI. I don't think it's really a daily use case yet. I think, we hope that it's really a weekly use case for now, because there are some gaps. It doesn't yet have access to real-time information and those sorts of things. So, our primary focus right now is just improving response quality. As you can imagine, it's a little hard to measure because the responses can be unpredictable. So, we think we've built a pretty good way of understanding if the responses people are getting are satisfactory and we're seeing some of the work we're doing to improve those responses lead to higher retention with the product overall. But I would say it's just very, very early with this product and we're going to keep the vast majority of our focus on response quality, which we think can drive more engagement and long-term retention. There's certainly plenty of commercial intent. We are taking steps to integrate that, for example, into our models to help folks see more relevant content and advertising. So, making some progress there as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Justin Post with Bank of America.\nJustin Post: Maybe I'll ask two. Lots of third-party data out here on engagement and time spent, just wondering how you'd characterize engagement on the platform and the drivers from here. And then, I think you gave some DAU guidance, some modest slowdown. What are you seeing as far as DAUs in North America and rest of the world in Q4? Thank you.\nEvan Spiegel: I'll let Derek speak to the guidance question, but overall, healthy engagement trends. We certainly see an opportunity in more developed regions like North America, where we do reach a very large percentage of the smartphone population to drive more daily usage with monthly active users. There are plenty of folks who are monthly active, but maybe not daily active, who have messages that are unread from friends or stories available. And so, we do see an opportunity to drive more frequency of use with monthly active users in regions like North America. Of course, plenty more headroom in the rest of world region in terms of incremental new users. We are also excited about what we're seeing on the content side. So, we saw a year-over-year acceleration in time spent growth globally and some positive trends in the U.S. as well with U.S. content time spent growing quarter-over-quarter. So, I'd say in terms of overall engagement, we're pleased we see opportunity to continue growing it.\nDerek Andersen: And just to pick up the second part of that on the DAU forecast that we shared for Q4, which is 410 million to 412 million, first, just for context, year-over-year growth right there is about 35 million to 37 million DAU year-over-year. So, still seeing really significant year-over-year growth. I think you've got to look at this a little bit market by market. In North America, in particular, as an example, and some of our other more mature markets, we're reaching really high percentages of 13- to 34-year-olds in over 25 countries. And that would include, of course, North America and many Western European countries. So, we're already at a very, very high penetration there. North America, for example, over 100 million DAU. And I think the latest number we shared on that was 150 million. So, the reach there is really, really deep. Our focus and much of the growth in the DAU number in total recently has been coming from the rest of world region. That's been the biggest driver of growth. We had a very good quarter in the prior year as a comp there and so you're seeing that a little bit impacted in the year-over-year rate there. But otherwise, continuing to see substantial year-over-year growth, that internal forecast range again implying 35 million to 37 million additional DAU on a year-over-year basis. So, hopefully that provides a little color.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, a little housekeeping. Derek, can you help us out just a little bit, sort of, with the amount of subscription revenue in 3Q? And then, what are you assuming on subscription revenue contribution in your fourth quarter guide at the midpoint of one of the areas? Then, the second one, it sounds like you're starting to make some progress on the performance strategy. Can you give us a few more tangible examples of categories or verticals where you've made the most progress? And how you think about the next category to really sort of improve the performance for advertisers. Thanks.\nDerek Andersen: Sure. Hey, I'll take the first part of that there. In terms of the breakdown on how we're doing on Snapchat+, I think first, we're really excited about what we're seeing there. That's a product that is not very old since we launched it. We reached more than 5 million subscribers in the period. So, we've had really nice momentum there. I think if you go back to the Investor Day at the beginning of the year, I think we shared then that we were running about close to $100 million annualized run rate then. You've seen the subscription number grow about 60% then. So, it'll give you some sort of a ballpark of where we're trending to in the most recent quarter on progress with that product. So certainly becoming a much more meaningful contributor. And we shared in the letter that it grew at a rate of more than 250% in the most recent quarter. So, I'm really pleased with what we're seeing there in terms of uptake and what that's contributing to the business, both from a top-line and margin perspective. Yeah, we don't have, obviously, we're going to break down our forward look for Q4 between different types of revenue, but we would expect to continue some momentum on the subscription business in the Q4, just as we would on the advertising business as well. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of an idea. I'll talk a little bit about where we're seeing some strength with advertisers, and then if Evan wants to chime in with more detail on where we expect to go from here. Really what we're seeing is we've been focusing very heavily on getting our go-to-market efforts and where we're seeing success in the progress of the ad platform really well aligned. And so making sure that we're selling through the products and the optimizations that are going to work for our advertisers and help them grow their business, that's what led us to see success with a pretty large variety of sectors. But some of the ones that we've talked about recently that I can share with you is we're seeing good traction with CPG, restaurants and traveler categories that have been doing well on the platform and combinations of an e-comm businesses also doing well, and that's going to align well to both -- what I talked about earlier which is the really good progress we've seen on 7/0 Pixel Purchase optimizations and what that's meant for lower-funnel revenue growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. And then also a little bit of the success that we've seen with those new brand takeover products and the traction that we got with those in Q3 that was helpful to the sequential improvement in revenue there. So, hopefully that gives you a little bit of a sense of what we're seeing both on the subscription side and the traction with different verticals of advertisers.\nEvan Spiegel: I could speak just briefly to the progress we've been making on the tech side of things. We're making a lot of headway with our ML platform, being able to run bigger models that have more features. So I think that -- I feel good about our progress there, obviously more to do. I think kind of the atomic unit of our performance business right now is 7/0 purchase optimization. That's working well for a lot of advertisers. And so, really what we've been trying to do is then build on top of that to solve slightly more sophisticated advertiser needs. So, for example, with our app business, we've been beta testing event optimization for app advertisers. So, rather than just optimizing around an install, optimizing around something like completing a level or something like that in a game. And those sorts of optimizations are really important for certain performance advertisers. So, I think taking that sort of fundamental building block that's working with 7.0 and then iterating on top of that to meet more advertiser needs is really important right now. I also think there's more we can do in terms of advertiser cold start for the long tail of advertisers. It takes maybe a little too long and maybe a bit too much spend for these smaller advertisers to get ramped up and to find conversions quickly. So, we've also been iterating a lot there and making progress there. But overall, I feel good about where the various tech pieces are right now. And one of the things we've just been learning as we go deep with these bigger customers is that it's become a lot more about the way that they're using these different pieces of our platform together. So really auditing, signal quality, for example, going deep to make sure advertisers are bidding against the right goals for what they're measuring for. And I think just taking that customer success lens across all of our teams, from product to measurement, PMM, engineering, of course, to debug these more complex setups has yielded a lot of positive momentum as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Lloyd Walmsley with UBS.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thanks, a couple of parts to my question here. On the ads within My AI search, can you talk about how those are performing for you all, for advertisers? Are those all powered by Bing or some of them your own ads? And have you integrated that signal in the targeting across the platform? And I guess, just broadly, while we're on the topic, how do you think about turning to partners like Microsoft Bing or others, just in general, to enhance monetization across the platform more broadly, similar to what we've seen at Pinterest? Is that something you guys think about doing beyond the Bing integration?\nEvan Spiegel: It's still early with the partnership. I think the click-through rates are very healthy when the ads are relevant. So, the big focus has really been on improving relevance, continuing to drive relevance for sponsor links in My AI. So far in terms of signal integration, right now, we're using it to inform interest categories. I think there's a lot more we can do there, but we've sort of taken that initial step again sort of with the test and learn perspective. So, we think about this more as a longer-term investment, especially because the immediate work we're doing on that platform is yielding really meaningful results. So, we'll keep focusing on the product experience and of course, experimenting with the partnership, but there are more important priorities, I think, in terms of the ad platform right now.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. And I just want to get into a nuts and bolts issue on ARPU or a question on ARPU. You had two kind of interesting trends here. European ARPU kind of jumped a lot. And I know this is an output indicator, but could you just maybe explain why that [did end just] (ph) like a 15% year-over-year growth? And then sequentially, North American ARPU jumped a lot. It's kind of the biggest sequential growth we've seen in a while. So, just any color behind those two metrics? And again, I understand that their output metrics, but any color would be appreciated.\nDerek Andersen: Hey, Mark, it's Derek. Thanks for the question. Look, I think part of what you're seeing there is the fundamental improvements that we're making to the ad platform and the ad products in our go-to-market. So, for example, when you're looking at the year-over-year growth in the European region, what we're seeing there is that the fundamental improvements that we've made to the DR ad platform. So, some of the things I talked about earlier in terms of the big investments we've made in infrastructure to drive ad ranking and optimization, the work that we've done to incorporate a broader range of signals and features into those models and then those models themselves becoming much larger. The faster pace of experimentation that we're seeing on the DR ad platform, all of that's driving out much more precise conversion predictions. And that's driving improved ROI for advertisers. And you can see that, as I mentioned earlier, in the improvement in lower funnel year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. And then the other thing is what I also mentioned earlier, which is these new brand products to be launched earlier this year, they got very nice traction in Q3, including First Story and the Total Takeover products, and then, of course, the go-to-market improvements that we've been making. And I think one thing in particular in Europe and to a certain -- and to an extent, in the APAC region is that the new region precedence for those regions came on prior to us making the significant changes to our ad platform in Q1 and prior to launching these products. And so those fundamental improvements to the ad product, the ad platform and the go-to-market, those are not just unique to the European region. For the most part, they're going to be globally applicable, including some of the really good improvements -- we're making the scalable solutions for small and medium-sized businesses. But you can see some of that is impacting North America a little later. And that's why North America, for example, was the fastest region quarter-over-quarter at 14% sequentially in growth, and that's a combination of those fundamental improvements coming to bear on the North America market, as well as the improved go-to-market exercise there. So, I think what you're seeing is the work starting to show up in the output and the fundamental progress we're making with the ad platform, and that's showing up in ARPU, which is great news for the business all around. So, thanks for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session as well as Snap Inc.'s third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Thank you for attending today's session. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Derek Andersen",
            "content": "Hi, there. Doug, it's Derek speaking. I'll take that one for you. First and foremost, you're right, we had a quarter in Q3 that we're pretty pleased with on the progress we made on top-line. There's a lot that went into that. We had a number of drivers to that outcome, including the progress we've made on our direct-response ad platform. We continue to make really significant investments in the ad ranking and optimization, incorporating a much broader range of signals into the ad platform and driving much larger models. And we've also instituted a much faster pace of experimentation. All of that's leading to more precise conversion predictions, improved ROI for advertisers. And as we noted in the letter in particular, 7/0 has been a bright spot in the quarter in terms of driving Pixel Purchase behavior and the year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth that we saw in lower funnel. And I also note that part of the strength in Q3 was around brand advertising where we saw really good uptake on our Total Takeover products, including First Story that launched in the period. So, really pleased with the momentum that we saw there. And I think as you look into Q4, I think we talked about a little bit in the letter, but to share some high-level color, we believe we're on the right path for the DR platform. So, we're pleased with the continuous progress we're making there, working with our partners on making their privacy safe integrations with the platform, higher quality and more performance for them and driving performance. We're also pleased with what we're seeing on our scaled solutions for small and medium-sized businesses and what that drove out in terms of quarter-over-quarter growth in Q3 of 11% in aggregate and the DR business returning to year-over-year growth. So, we're really pleased with fundamentally what we're seeing there and what we're executing against into the new quarter. I think on the brand side in particular, coming off of the progress that we saw in Q3 with those new brand products seeing really good uptake, you're right, as we move into Q4, Q4 is a little bit different as a quarter. Historically, we've seen a little bit larger share of the revenue coming from brand products in Q4. And then two, the Q4 business being a little bit more back-end weighted than other quarters historically as well. So, both of those things sort of impacting visibility. And brand having grown at a slower rate in Q3 and being a larger share of the business in Q4 sort of brings a little bit of a mix shift headwind. And then last, the point that you raised very specifically, which is what we've seen since the onset of the war in the Middle East is we have had a number of primarily brand-oriented campaigns pause spending in the early period after the onset of the war there in the Middle East. I will say that we have seen a lot of those campaigns resume spending. And the impact to our daily run rate has reduced significantly as a result of that. But we also have seen a very small amount of incremental campaign pauses triple in more recently. And so, one of the things that we've tried to do here when we're thinking about giving forward-looking information for Q4 is number one, be transparent about what we've seen quarter-to-date on that side. And then, I think when we look back historically, for example, to what we all experienced at the onset of the war in Ukraine and the impact that that had on folks' business and the operating environment, I think we've realized that war is fundamentally unpredictable. And as a result, it would be imprudent to provide a formal guide in that kind of an environment. However, what we did do for the sake of transparency for the investment community to share our internal forecast, and that internal forecast assumes an acceleration at the top end. But we've attempted to incorporate everything that we know as of today about the impact of those pauses into the fullness of the range of revenue so that you can see that. And then, of course, that obviously flows right through to the adjusted EBITDA range as well, because we have a very high rate of flow through on those. So, I think stepping back fundamentally, we're pleased with the progress we're making on the DR business. And we're pleased, we think we're on the right path with that platform. And we're also pleased with the uptake that we saw from those new brand products in Q3 as well. So I think, the progress there is good. We just want to make sure that people are aware of that one headwind we've seen to begin the quarter. And hopefully that gives you a little bit of color on how we frame that. Thank you. And just to pick up the second part of that on the DAU forecast that we shared for Q4, which is 410 million to 412 million, first, just for context, year-over-year growth right there is about 35 million to 37 million DAU year-over-year. So, still seeing really significant year-over-year growth. I think you've got to look at this a little bit market by market. In North America, in particular, as an example, and some of our other more mature markets, we're reaching really high percentages of 13- to 34-year-olds in over 25 countries. And that would include, of course, North America and many Western European countries. So, we're already at a very, very high penetration there. North America, for example, over 100 million DAU. And I think the latest number we shared on that was 150 million. So, the reach there is really, really deep. Our focus and much of the growth in the DAU number in total recently has been coming from the rest of world region. That's been the biggest driver of growth. We had a very good quarter in the prior year as a comp there and so you're seeing that a little bit impacted in the year-over-year rate there. But otherwise, continuing to see substantial year-over-year growth, that internal forecast range again implying 35 million to 37 million additional DAU on a year-over-year basis. So, hopefully that provides a little color. Sure. Hey, I'll take the first part of that there. In terms of the breakdown on how we're doing on Snapchat+, I think first, we're really excited about what we're seeing there. That's a product that is not very old since we launched it. We reached more than 5 million subscribers in the period. So, we've had really nice momentum there. I think if you go back to the Investor Day at the beginning of the year, I think we shared then that we were running about close to $100 million annualized run rate then. You've seen the subscription number grow about 60% then. So, it'll give you some sort of a ballpark of where we're trending to in the most recent quarter on progress with that product. So certainly becoming a much more meaningful contributor. And we shared in the letter that it grew at a rate of more than 250% in the most recent quarter. So, I'm really pleased with what we're seeing there in terms of uptake and what that's contributing to the business, both from a top-line and margin perspective. Yeah, we don't have, obviously, we're going to break down our forward look for Q4 between different types of revenue, but we would expect to continue some momentum on the subscription business in the Q4, just as we would on the advertising business as well. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of an idea. I'll talk a little bit about where we're seeing some strength with advertisers, and then if Evan wants to chime in with more detail on where we expect to go from here. Really what we're seeing is we've been focusing very heavily on getting our go-to-market efforts and where we're seeing success in the progress of the ad platform really well aligned. And so making sure that we're selling through the products and the optimizations that are going to work for our advertisers and help them grow their business, that's what led us to see success with a pretty large variety of sectors. But some of the ones that we've talked about recently that I can share with you is we're seeing good traction with CPG, restaurants and traveler categories that have been doing well on the platform and combinations of an e-comm businesses also doing well, and that's going to align well to both -- what I talked about earlier which is the really good progress we've seen on 7/0 Pixel Purchase optimizations and what that's meant for lower-funnel revenue growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. And then also a little bit of the success that we've seen with those new brand takeover products and the traction that we got with those in Q3 that was helpful to the sequential improvement in revenue there. So, hopefully that gives you a little bit of a sense of what we're seeing both on the subscription side and the traction with different verticals of advertisers. Hey, Mark, it's Derek. Thanks for the question. Look, I think part of what you're seeing there is the fundamental improvements that we're making to the ad platform and the ad products in our go-to-market. So, for example, when you're looking at the year-over-year growth in the European region, what we're seeing there is that the fundamental improvements that we've made to the DR ad platform. So, some of the things I talked about earlier in terms of the big investments we've made in infrastructure to drive ad ranking and optimization, the work that we've done to incorporate a broader range of signals and features into those models and then those models themselves becoming much larger. The faster pace of experimentation that we're seeing on the DR ad platform, all of that's driving out much more precise conversion predictions. And that's driving improved ROI for advertisers. And you can see that, as I mentioned earlier, in the improvement in lower funnel year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. And then the other thing is what I also mentioned earlier, which is these new brand products to be launched earlier this year, they got very nice traction in Q3, including First Story and the Total Takeover products, and then, of course, the go-to-market improvements that we've been making. And I think one thing in particular in Europe and to a certain -- and to an extent, in the APAC region is that the new region precedence for those regions came on prior to us making the significant changes to our ad platform in Q1 and prior to launching these products. And so those fundamental improvements to the ad product, the ad platform and the go-to-market, those are not just unique to the European region. For the most part, they're going to be globally applicable, including some of the really good improvements -- we're making the scalable solutions for small and medium-sized businesses. But you can see some of that is impacting North America a little later. And that's why North America, for example, was the fastest region quarter-over-quarter at 14% sequentially in growth, and that's a combination of those fundamental improvements coming to bear on the North America market, as well as the improved go-to-market exercise there. So, I think what you're seeing is the work starting to show up in the output and the fundamental progress we're making with the ad platform, and that's showing up in ARPU, which is great news for the business all around. So, thanks for the question."

            "name": "Evan Spiegel",
            "content": "Hi, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. Our revenue returned to positive growth in Q3, increasing 5% year-over-year and flowing through to positive adjusted EBITDA as our reprioritized cost structure demonstrated the leverage in our business model. We are focused on improving our advertising platform to drive higher return on investment for our advertising partners, and we have evolved our go-to-market efforts to better serve our partners and drive customer success. We also made progress toward diversifying our revenue with Snapchat+ reaching more than 5 million subscribers in the quarter, resulting in Snapchat+ revenue growing more than 250% year-over-year. Our focus on visual communication between friends and family is a strategic advantage that has enabled us to build engaging and retentive products and services across our platform. Our community grew to 406 million daily active users in Q3, and we are working to further deepen content engagement by focusing on three key areas: investing in our ML models to improve content ranking and personalization across all of our content surfaces; growing our creator community and diversity of content by supporting and rewarding creators; and using content to start conversations and build relationships across our service. We continue to leverage AI technology to deliver new products and features to our community. Since launching My AI, more than 200 million people have sent more than 20 billion messages, which we believe makes My AI one of the most used AI chatbots available today. More than 250 million Snapchatters engage with AR experiences on our platform every day on average. On November 9, we will be live streaming our sixth annual Lens Fest. We're thrilled to have the opportunity to bring together the vibrant Snap AR community of developers and creators that are collaborating with us to push boundaries, redefine what's possible with augmented reality, and build businesses along the way. Given the progress we have made with our ad platform, the leadership team we have built, the work we have done to reprioritize our cost structure and the strength of our balance sheet, we believe we are well positioned to continue making progress on our top strategic priorities. As we move forward into Q4 and 2024, we remain focused on investing in our platform to sustain community growth, investing heavily in our direct-response business to deliver measurable return on ad spend, and cultivating new sources of revenue to diversify our top-line growth to build a more resilient business. I want to thank Jerry Hunter, our Chief Operating Officer, for seven years of service at Snap. Jerry has notified us of his intent to retire and will be transitioning his responsibilities by the end of the month. I am deeply grateful to Jerry for the meaningful contributions he has made over his many years at Snap. His work to improve our advertising platform, serve our community, and build a strong team has helped to lay the foundation for our future growth. Thank you. And with that, we will begin our Q&A session. Hey, Ross, thanks so much for the question. Yeah, we are making some progress in North America, the fastest growing region quarter-over-quarter, but obviously, a long way from where we'd like it to be. In general, North America has a number of large customers that are simply just more complex to work with. So, while we've made a lot of progress with some of the simpler integrations, our 7/0 optimization and whatnot for smaller advertisers, it's just taken more of a focus and more in the details work to drive customer success with larger advertisers. So, I'm pleased with the progress that we're making. We're fixing stuff every day and getting advertisers closer to hitting their KPIs, or in many cases, above their KPIs, which should translate into improved spend. So making progress there, but definitely more complex customers. And we're excited about Patrick's leadership of the team. He's got a wealth of experience to bring. Thanks, Rich. Yeah, that's an internal memo really designed to motivate and inspire the team around what's possible. When it comes to the content penetration, that's really going to be driven by emerging countries where, in some cases, our growth there is earlier in its cycle and so folks are just ramping up with our communications products and have yet to really transition to the content-focused products. So, when we talk about 80% of DAU, in aggregate, what we're really trying to accomplish is breadth of content engagement in some of the emerging countries and then really depth of engagement in the more developed countries where we do have a very high rate of DAUs engaging with content already. So that's really how that strategy -- how we're thinking about the content strategy. The 20% revenue, that's really about making more progress in terms of customer success, especially with the lower funnel. We are excited about the progress that we're seeing. So, we're hoping we can just keep our heads down and keep making more progress there. Yeah. We're excited about the progress we're seeing with My AI. I don't think it's really a daily use case yet. I think, we hope that it's really a weekly use case for now, because there are some gaps. It doesn't yet have access to real-time information and those sorts of things. So, our primary focus right now is just improving response quality. As you can imagine, it's a little hard to measure because the responses can be unpredictable. So, we think we've built a pretty good way of understanding if the responses people are getting are satisfactory and we're seeing some of the work we're doing to improve those responses lead to higher retention with the product overall. But I would say it's just very, very early with this product and we're going to keep the vast majority of our focus on response quality, which we think can drive more engagement and long-term retention. There's certainly plenty of commercial intent. We are taking steps to integrate that, for example, into our models to help folks see more relevant content and advertising. So, making some progress there as well. I'll let Derek speak to the guidance question, but overall, healthy engagement trends. We certainly see an opportunity in more developed regions like North America, where we do reach a very large percentage of the smartphone population to drive more daily usage with monthly active users. There are plenty of folks who are monthly active, but maybe not daily active, who have messages that are unread from friends or stories available. And so, we do see an opportunity to drive more frequency of use with monthly active users in regions like North America. Of course, plenty more headroom in the rest of world region in terms of incremental new users. We are also excited about what we're seeing on the content side. So, we saw a year-over-year acceleration in time spent growth globally and some positive trends in the U.S. as well with U.S. content time spent growing quarter-over-quarter. So, I'd say in terms of overall engagement, we're pleased we see opportunity to continue growing it. I could speak just briefly to the progress we've been making on the tech side of things. We're making a lot of headway with our ML platform, being able to run bigger models that have more features. So I think that -- I feel good about our progress there, obviously more to do. I think kind of the atomic unit of our performance business right now is 7/0 purchase optimization. That's working well for a lot of advertisers. And so, really what we've been trying to do is then build on top of that to solve slightly more sophisticated advertiser needs. So, for example, with our app business, we've been beta testing event optimization for app advertisers. So, rather than just optimizing around an install, optimizing around something like completing a level or something like that in a game. And those sorts of optimizations are really important for certain performance advertisers. So, I think taking that sort of fundamental building block that's working with 7.0 and then iterating on top of that to meet more advertiser needs is really important right now. I also think there's more we can do in terms of advertiser cold start for the long tail of advertisers. It takes maybe a little too long and maybe a bit too much spend for these smaller advertisers to get ramped up and to find conversions quickly. So, we've also been iterating a lot there and making progress there. But overall, I feel good about where the various tech pieces are right now. And one of the things we've just been learning as we go deep with these bigger customers is that it's become a lot more about the way that they're using these different pieces of our platform together. So really auditing, signal quality, for example, going deep to make sure advertisers are bidding against the right goals for what they're measuring for. And I think just taking that customer success lens across all of our teams, from product to measurement, PMM, engineering, of course, to debug these more complex setups has yielded a lot of positive momentum as well. It's still early with the partnership. I think the click-through rates are very healthy when the ads are relevant. So, the big focus has really been on improving relevance, continuing to drive relevance for sponsor links in My AI. So far in terms of signal integration, right now, we're using it to inform interest categories. I think there's a lot more we can do there, but we've sort of taken that initial step again sort of with the test and learn perspective. So, we think about this more as a longer-term investment, especially because the immediate work we're doing on that platform is yielding really meaningful results. So, we'll keep focusing on the product experience and of course, experimenting with the partnership, but there are more important priorities, I think, in terms of the ad platform right now."

I would now like to turn the call over to David Ometer, Head of Investor Relations.\nDavid Ometer: Thank you and good afternoon everyone.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Evan.\nEvan Spiegel: Hi everyone and thank you all for joining us. We began the second quarter of 2023 with a strong focus on growing our community, accelerating our revenue growth, and leading in augmented reality. Our community grew to 397 million daily active users in Q2, and we are working to deepen engagement with our content platform, with the number of content viewers and total time spent watching content increasing globally year-over-year. Our focus on visual communication between friends and family is a strategic advantage that has enabled us to build engaging and retentive products and services across our platform. To achieve a higher rate of revenue growth, we are focused on three key priorities. First, investing in our products to sustain community growth and deepen engagement. Second, investing heavily in our direct response business to deliver measurable return on spend for our advertising partners. Third, cultivating new sources of revenue to diversify our topline growth to build a more resilient business. We generated revenue of $1,068 million in Q2, a decrease of 4% year-over-year and an increase of 8% quarter-over-quarter. In Q1 of this year, we made changes to our ad platform to unify the ad experience across our service and retrained our models to drive more in-session click-through conversions. In Q2, we made progress toward improving results for advertisers through machine learning model updates and infrastructure improvements, new ways of measuring and optimizing advertising spend, and new leadership for our go-to-market efforts. We are encouraged to see that this progress is beginning to translate into improved results with record active advertisers in Q2, up more than 20% year-over-year, and through improved advertiser retention compared to the same time period last year. We made progress diversifying our revenue through Snapchat+, our subscription service that offers exclusive, experimental, and pre-release features, which now has more than 4 million subscribers. We are excited about the early progress we are making with AR Enterprise Services, our first SaaS offering, which helps retailers use our augmented reality platform to drive sales and reduce returns on their own applications and websites. We also rolled out My AI globally, and we recently began early testing of sponsored links in conversations with My AI. Diversifying our revenue growth is an important strategic initiative and we believe our leadership in messaging and AR technology provides a strong foundation to help connect businesses to our large and engaged community. We are calibrating our investment levels to build a path to free cash flow break-even or better, even with reduced rates of revenue growth. We will continue to invest with a long-term perspective, especially in areas that are critical to realizing the long-term opportunity of augmented reality. While our strategic investments in cloud-based ML infrastructure have put downward pressure on margins in the short-term, there are early signs that the improvements to ranking and personalization of our content and ad platforms are leading to deeper engagement with content by our community and stronger returns on investment for our advertising partners. We have further scrutinized our operating costs in order to invest incrementally only where it is necessary to achieve our strategic priorities and in particular to drive top line revenue acceleration. Last year we reorganized our team, reprioritized our business initiatives, and laid out our strategy to reaccelerate revenue growth by investing in community growth and engagement, improving our direct response advertising business, and diversifying the sources of our revenue. While we are still far from achieving the revenue growth to which we aspire, we believe that the momentum we have established in community growth and content engagement, the significant improvements we are seeing in return on investment for direct response advertisers, and the early growth of Snapchat+ to more than 4 million subscribers, demonstrate progress and further validate our strategic focus. Thank you, and with that we will begin our Q&A session.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Mark Shmulik with Bernstein. You may proceed.\nMark Shmulik: Yes, thanks for taking the questions. So Derek, on the guide, this is the first time you've guided in a while, but I guess I imagine investors were hoping for a bit more sequential improvement. Can you share just what's giving you the confidence to guide more formally now? And just how to think about some of these puts and takes that get into that guide? And then I guess as a follow-up, a bit more longer-term focused for Jerry, in the investor letter, you talked a lot about adding a lot of ad impressions, active advertisers up a lot, still rebuilding the ad server, launching new ad products. It sounds like many of your historic major advisers are still not back to kind of where they were. What's the easiest way to think about getting back to double-digit growth, if you were to stack rank? Is it getting these new ad buyers to increase your wallet or really focusing on your kind of major accounts and getting the back? Thanks.\nDerek Andersen: Hey, it's Derek speaking. Thanks for the question. And you're right. I'd note that we've not provided formal guidance since the very beginning of 2022. So it is a big shift for us to begin providing formal guidance again. And I think that does reflect an increased confidence in the trajectory of our business. We've historically, I think when we've approached thinking about guidance, one of the things that we've tried to do is make sure that we're reasonably including at the top end, the attainable upside that we see in the business. And then on the downside, making sure that we're including the reasonably visible and quantifiable downside on that side. So, as we enter Q3, the business is in a period of rapid transition as we invest to drive improved performance on our ad platform. You'll note that we've ramped investment in infrastructure really rapidly to support monetization as well as the depth of content engagement and my AI, each of which is or will be a key input to monetization over time. And given the progress we're seeing there, we're pretty excited and encouraged. We've seen active advertisers up 20% year-over-year, higher active advertiser retention year-over-year and a more than 30% lift in purchase-related conversions. So, we're increasingly confident that these investments are a key input to sustain revenue growth over time. That said, how the continued ramp in these investments will impact the ad platform performance, advertiser demand and topline growth in the immediate weeks and months ahead is more difficult to predict with precision. In addition, forward visibility of advertising demand remains somewhat limited. We've seen continued strength with verticals such as CPG and restaurants and travel. Well, we've got some other sectors that continue to face challenges that are unique to their sector or the macro environment and therefore, make forward visibility on advertising demand, a little bit more difficult or challenging to calibrate, especially in a quarter is typically somewhat back-end weighted. So, for Q3, the guidance range calls for a range of between negative 5% and flat on a year-over-year growth basis. And we think this reasonably includes the attainable upside and all of these risk we see that could possibly drive us towards the low end. So, I hope that is a good set of context for how we think about guidance generally, given we haven't done it for a while and how we arrived at it specifically for this quarter. Thanks for the question. I'll turn it over for the other one.\nJerry Hunter: Hey Mark, this is Jerry. Thanks for the question. Let me just kind of give you a little bit of history on what's going on here. We had a small number of customers who were adversely impacted by those changes that we made. They were mostly concentrated in North America, and that's why you'll see the disruptive impact of those changes are most pronounced in North America. But one of the things to note is that the advertisers who were impacted over half of them have recovered their spend to prior levels in previous years. And so we've made a lot of progress with that. We're learning about what it takes to make these advertisers successful and we're working with those remaining advertisers to get them back to that level as well. I do feel pretty confident or comfortable about the direction we're taking. As Derek mentioned, we are seeing more active advertisers and it's a diverse set of advertisers, the number of active advertisers is up 20% year-over-year. And we are -- most importantly, I think we're seeing more spending year-over-year in advertiser spending on lower funnel optimization, which is where we've been spending a lot of our time. Let me also just kind of give you a sense about what we're doing to increase share of wallet and grow the space, grow demand. A year ago when we restructured the team and reprioritized this business, we've got in this very experienced leadership team to drive more operational focus, and I'm pretty excited about the work that's happening here. First leader that joined was Ronan Harris, and we're seeing some very good progress in EMEA. Ajit Mohan joined shortly after that, and you'll see that we're seeing progress in APAC. We've got a couple of hires that I'm pretty excited about. We've started working in their space as Rob Wilk joined recently in the Americas and Patrick Harris is overseeing our global partnership space, and they're starting to take action in their teams. So, as we look into the second half, the core focus is accelerating revenue. And what we're starting to see, let's see, we've improved processes for bringing in new clients or prospecting processes, and we know that our ad platform updates are giving major new opportunities for these new clients in addition to these -- our top clients of old. We launched several go-to-market process improvements, which are showing positive results, both in increased share of wallet with existing customers and growth relative to market verticals that we're operating in. A couple of other things we're doing. We're systematically improving the implementation of our ad products. That means a systematic and scale program for understanding advertiser objectives, ensuring that they've got the right implementation on the signals we need for their campaigns, making sure that their campaigns are set up successfully and then just working with them, iterating with them, which is, again, where we've seen success with the existing customers that are back to previous spend. We're also working on automating those steps so we can make sure these are easier for advertisers going forward. So this is just a few of the things that we're doing to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the go-to-market space that I think is going to bring more customers and more demand to the space. Thanks for that question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Rich Greenfield with Lightshed Partners. You may proceed.\nRich Greenfield: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, Evan, I guess the thing that everyone is thinking about is like there's -- it feels like there's this disconnect between the overall headcount of the company because I think in the release, you sort of talked about reprioritizing where the employee base is. And I think the question is, how many of the employees are near-term or even medium-term revenue focused versus longer term projects. We've seen and not that we always love them, but you've seen people like Elon and even Bob Iger made some very hard decisions on reprioritizing initiatives, making big headcount cuts, you still have like 5,300 employees working? Are there still a lot of employees that are working on like five-plus year projects that are not generating revenue? Like I think is there some way you could frame how many people today work in AR versus spectacles versus advertising? You just mentioned some important recent hires versus the content side of it, which is what I think are like spotlight and how much spotlight can offer you in terms of growth? Like how have you changed the balance? What does that look like today? Are you done optimizing? And like do you have to still make hard decisions on headcount going forward? Because 5,300 people with revenues declining still seems problematic for a lot of investors given how your stocks reacting after ours?\nEvan Spiegel: Hey Rich, thanks so much for the question. We've always been clear that we're building Snap for the long-term. And that means that we really have to strike the right balance between growing and optimizing the business we have today and also planting seeds for future growth. And that's really core to how we've evolved from being a simple messenger to a diversified platform with engagement across our map, augmented reality and, of course, content and stories and spotlight. As you know, engagement is a fundamental input to monetization on Snapchat, which is why we're focused on innovation. It's really the only way we've been able to compete with companies that are far bigger than we are, the way we've been able to grow to more than 750 million people using our service around the world. And sometimes these new products are monetizable immediately, but oftentimes, as we grow engagement, they become monetizable in the future. And this was definitely the case for our content business and, of course, for our AR platform as well. So when we confronted the rapidly changing economic environment a year ago, we made the difficult decision to sunset up some products that hadn't yet reached scale and we reduced the size of our team by approximately at 20%. And as I mentioned, we support a community of more than 75 0 million people as well as our advertising partners and content partners, and we do that with a team of about 5,000 people. So on a revenue per headcount basis, I think you could make the case that we should actually invest more, especially given the size of our long-term opportunity, but we wanted to really thoughtfully manage our cash flow and dilution because financing costs have increased and our share price has trended lower. So things like spectacles or AR enterprise services, for example, build on core investments that we're making today in our AR platform. That's driving revenue and engagement on Snapchat right now. And that really represents a focused way to build on our core strengths by investing in longer-term initiatives that are technically complex and more difficult to replicate. So by building on those core strengths in AR, we're able to make long-term focused investments more efficiently because these efforts represent an extension of our core platform rather than totally new bets. So of course, from a headcount perspective, while I wish we could invest more in some of our more long-term initiatives. I think we have the right balance for where we're at today. And we really need to accelerate near-term revenue growth will simultaneously setting up the business to sustain that revenue growth over the longer term. So fortunately, we've got a balance sheet to navigate this challenging period. So we don't have to sigabite our longer-term opportunity as we tackle some of the shorter-term headwinds.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Katie [ph] on for Doug. Thanks for taking the question. First, I just wanted to dive deeper into the infrastructure cost. It feels like you're stepping up again materially get into the third quarter. So just curious if you could walk us through again what these are calling towards. I mean it feels like it's even higher now than how you were thinking about things a couple of months ago? So is there a change there in terms of that level of investments? And how can we measure that these investments are paying off? Thanks.\nDerek Andersen: Hi, it's Derek. Thanks for that question. So first noted, the investments we're making in the near-term here in infrastructure are substantial. We've been making investments into a number of areas. And so I'll break that down for you a little bit. First, into our ad platform in order to make the advertising platform more performance and then second, into driving ML for content in order to drive deeper depth of engagement with our content platform, and then a lesser portion of the investment into products like My AI, which are intended to support that product and other innovative products on the platform. But as I mentioned, a substantial portion of the investment going into things more directly related to a media monetization like the ad platform and depth of content engagement. I think importantly, as we made a very big ramp in the investment over the past quarter, we shared last quarter that we wanted to see results from that investment in order for us to sustain that forward. And so I mentioned a little bit of this earlier, but across each of those areas where we're putting investment in, we're really encouraged with the early results we're seeing from those investments. So whether that's the 20% rise in active advertisers, higher retention and importantly, the 30% increase in purchase-related conversions that we saw in Q2, these are all really important signs of the investments that we're making into the DR ad platform are beginning to pay-off and makes us happy with the investment we've made there. Similarly, on the content side, and we started ramping investments in ML to support depth of content engagement sooner. And so that's been ramping over a longer period of time. And you can see, as a proof point there, for example, that timespan was spotlight more than tripled year-over-year in the most recent quarter. So again, really pleased with the progress of the investments that we're putting in there. It's early for My AI, and as I mentioned, it's a smaller portion of the investment. But I -- we have shared some data points in our investor letter and recently that we are seeing really high volumes of conversations with My AI to provide clear intent signals about products and services that our community is interested in. And of course, that has obvious ramifications for our ad platform and monetization over time. So given the results we're seeing today, we do expect to make a further step-up in investment here in Q3 to accelerate the progress on what we're seeing here, and in particular, to accelerate the progress we're seeing on things related that are very directly related to monetization. So, if you look at Q2, the step-up in Q2 was about $0.11 to $0.70 on per DAU we've shared that our guide for Q3 is for a range of between $0.79 and $0.84. So, at the midpoint of that range, it would be a similar step-up in Q3 that we saw in Q2. As we move forward, we're going to continue to calibrate these investments incredibly carefully to ensure that they're both productive and affordable over a reasonable time horizon. Importantly, I wouldn't simply assume that the sequential increases in infrastructure per DAU that we've observed in Q2 and guided for Q3 will lead to similar increases in Q4 or future periods. We're going to measure the returns on these investments carefully. And whether they are sustained forward at current levels, shrink, or grow from here will depend entirely on the results we see from the spend and then in particular, the acceleration we experienced in our topline. The last sort of note I'll make here is we remain committed to charting accords towards adjusted EBITDA profitability and positive free cash flow even at reduced growth rates and into the medium term and longer term margin targets that we shared at our Investor Day. Today, I think we've been able to balance those investments carefully even through a period of incredible transition on our ad platform. Today, we've been able to deliver on that with free cash flow over the trailing 12 months at positive $81 million and trailing 12-month operating cash flow at about $250 million. So, we've been very careful to make that balance over a reasonable time horizon, and we'll continue to do that going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Tom Champion with Piper Sandler. You may proceed.\nTom Champion: Hi, good afternoon. Can you talk a little bit about the progress with DR tools? Where are you today relative to your plan and what you hope to implement? And I'm wondering if you could just speak briefly on Scan 4.0 adoption and whether that might be helping you recapture some lost cohorts over the last year, I'm thinking of verticals like gaming or app downloads? Any comments there would be helpful. Thank you.\nEvan Spiegel: Hey Tom, thanks so much for the question. We're really excited about the progress we're making on our DR tools. Obviously, over the last year, a huge priority for us has been signal restoration. So, creating solutions like conversions, API that advertisers can integrate to pass back signals in a privacy safe way. I'd tell you, our focus right now is really more on the go-to-market side because what we're finding is when advertisers have integrated our solutions and configure them correctly, they're really able to drive strong results. And this is especially the case with e-commerce and pixel purchase where we're seeing some strong momentum. So, what we've been trying to do is scaled out with our go-to-market efforts. So, for example, we released a new dashboard for our team to be able to make sure that advertisers are sharing signals correctly in a privacy safe way. That's helping us find these configuration errors that if we can correct can lead to much stronger results for advertising partners, and we're definitely taking a more consultative approach with clients as well. So, I think for e-commerce advertisers and purchase-related conversions, we're seeing a lot of progress there. On the app side, there's still some work to do, and that will be a big focus for us in the back half of the year. Scan will be a piece of that, but there are tools like value optimization, for example, where app advertisers want to be able to optimize against users, they think we'll spend a lot of money in their app, for example. And we don't offer that level of fine grain optimization today. So app will be a priority for us. But I think the good news is we're seeing some real momentum on the e-commerce side and the work we've done to update our models and focus on click-through conversions is really -- is delivering strong results for advertisers. So think of it as go-to market is key for our e-commerce focused advertisers. And then on the app side, there's a little more work to do, but we've got a clear path to getting there by the end of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Justin Post with Bank of America. You may proceed.\nJustin Post: Great. Thank you. And I apologize if these have already been asked. A couple of questions. First on the gross margin pressure, is there a level of cost per user or a gross margin level where you think that can level off? How should we think about gross margins kind of a year or two years from now? And then really interesting usage stats on Spotlight. I'm wondering if that is more than offsetting the stories pressure at this point, or if you're seeing overall trends flipping positive as far as usage per user related to Spotlight. How much of that moving the needle for the entire ecosystem? Thank you.\nDerek Andersen: Hey there, it's Derek speaking. I think on the gross margin pressure, I would say, on the medium and long-term, we articulated what we expected margins to look like on the gross margin side, at our recent Investor Day. And while we've had a really substantial step-up in infrastructure investment in Q2, and we expect to make another substantial step-up in infrastructure investment in Q3, I don't view that as changing what we expect for medium and long-term gross margins. Importantly, the gross margin story for Snap is going to be about reaccelerating the top line growth and how our business scales in a growth scenario. What we're seeing right now is a significant opportunity and need to invest in infrastructure to support the performance of our direct response advertising business and a significant opportunity to invest in infrastructure to drive depth of engagement, which will contribute to our advertising opportunity over time, as well as in other innovative products like my AI where we see a direct input to understanding intent and interest, which also contributes directly to the top line engagement. So what you're seeing here is a really significant step-up in this immediate period of time in order to support the transition in our business and our top line in order to reaccelerate. I would though still expect that our business will show phenomenal unit economics as we're able to reaccelerate the top line. And I won't reiterate it here because I've already talked at length about the early progress we're seeing from those infrastructure investments. But we certainly -- I think the double down on the infrastructure investment in Q3 is a sign in addition to the metrics I've already shared that we're incredibly confident about how those infrastructure investments are contributing to the reacceleration of the top line and towards sustained longer-term growth. So anyway, hopefully, that gives you a better understanding on margins. I realize it's choppy in the very near-term, but we think this is critical to reaccelerating the top line. And I'll turn it over to Evan to take the second question you had there on Spotlight.\nEvan Spiegel: Thanks so much for the question about Spotlight and our content business. We're really excited about the trends that we're seeing. Obviously, globally, content viewers and content time spend continue to grow meaningfully, and Spotlight has been a big driver of that, reaching 400 million monthly active users in the quarter with time spent up 3x year-over-year. So we're definitely excited by that momentum. In the US specifically, the trends we've seen are essentially friend stories, viewership is trending better than we had forecast. So the rate at which the viewership decline is happening has slowed. And at the same time, we're seeing some real momentum with Spotlight. So I'm not sure in aggregate, if we flip positive yet, I think we're getting closer which is really exciting and the trends are moving in the right direction. So globally, a lot of momentum in content in the US as well, a combination of friend stories performing better than we had expected and then Spotlight and crater stories driving a lot of momentum for us.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ross Sandler with Barclays. You may proceed.\nRoss Sandler: Hey, guys. I just had two questions. The first is a follow-up on the hot topic of infrastructure cost per user. So there's a lot going on here with like the rebuilding of the ad model, the content ranking model, some of the generative AI products that you're building for lens creation, et cetera. And then there's my AI, which just took off like crazy for the last 10 weeks or so. So is the uptick based on the first bucket, which is all these kind of discrete projects that are going on or the second bucket, meaning inference costs for my AI is going up, and so that's just a reflection of like future usage? And then how do you expect those two buckets to play out as we think about that hosting cost per user. And then the second question is you guys have three new regional heads of sales, I think they've been to see for now a little over a quarter. Just how do you feel about that team? And is the success in bringing back some of those large advertisers who have cut back a function of just time and getting more confidence around the attribution or do you expect these new sales organizations to really start to move the needle on revenue? Any thoughts on that?\nDerek Andersen: Hey, it's Derek speaking. I'll take the first bit on infrastructure. And speaking specifically about the drivers we've tried to speak to the sort of an order of magnitude. But definitely, the focus here is in both Q2 and as we look forward to Q3 in the incremental investments that we're making to drive the advertising platform, specifically in depth of content engagement. Certainly, there are other investments that we're making in infrastructure to drive other products. And you mentioned my AI, which is specifically one of them. The investment there is much smaller. And then there's other investments we're making in things like lenses and so on that you mentioned again. The big focus here of the investment is on the investments necessary to drive the improvement in the ad platform as well as the investment opportunity to drive depth of engagement, which contributes directly to the ability to drive up inventory and grow revenue over the longer term. In terms of how my AI scales over time, I think it's been manageable so far, as I mentioned, a smaller component of the overall ramp in the spend. And we're continuing to watch it carefully, but we've been pleased with unit economics so far and the relationship between how we think that can contribute to intent and personalization and monetization relative to the unit cost. So we'll monitor that carefully over time. But so far, we're comfortable with what we're seeing there. And it's not the focus of the ramp that we're experiencing in general. Hopefully, that context is helpful there and understanding what's going on. I'll turn it over for the second part of the question.\nEvan Spiegel: Yes. I guess, I can chat a little bit about our regional presidents. So Jerry doesn't have to pick a favorite. Ronan has been in the role of the longest started about nine months ago overseeing EMEA. He's made a lot of progress and really identified much better ways for us to go to market there. We've been taking those learnings, actually and applying them around the world. Jeet is now leading our business in APAC. He's been here not quite as long as Ronan but been here for a bit. And Rob just started in the Americas in Q2. So I think we've got a bit of work to do in the Americas. Rob has been making changes to quickly building out vertical plans to really understand where the opportunity is. And of course, spending time with a couple of the advertisers who've not yet returned to prior levels of spend. I think the reasons are pretty varied as we kind of dig into that bucket. And in some cases, there are advertisers with competitors who have who are actually ramping their spend considerably and seeing much better performance than they ever saw before. So we've really been trying to debug on a case-by-case basis and make sure advertisers have adopted our solutions correctly. But I think more importantly, as we look forward, building a more diversified base of advertisers because we're focusing on these lower funnel goals is going to be really important for our business. And I know Rob is thinking a lot about how to build out the torso of our advertisers because we do -- we have seen a lot of success with this more focused strategy in the Americas, but it's clear we also need to diversify our advertiser base. So I know that will be a real priority for the team. But I think just taking a step back, it's been really exciting to get this regional focus on our business more broadly, not just in terms of revenue, but also in terms of user growth and partnership and of course, everything we're doing on the content side. So seeing that focus translated into results has been really gratifying in EMEA and APAC, and we'll be excited to hopefully return to growth in North America soon.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question is from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks for taking the question. I'll just squeeze one in. A lot's already been asked. But maybe just broadly, your view of the competitive landscape for user growth, engagement, sort of rising utility in your app vis-\u00e0-vis other potential competitive companies. How are you thinking about the mixture of what you see as the competitive landscape, where do your strengths fit today to invest behind and lean into? And we've talked a little bit about it on the call, but elements of continuing to capture rising utility on the consumer side that can produce sort of signal and measurement and advertising or monetization opportunities as you look out over the medium to long term? Thanks so much.\nEvan Spiegel: Yes. Thanks so much for the question. We're really excited about this unique role we play in the market, connecting friends and family with visual communication. And we use our strength in that very frequent visual communication to build other businesses around it. So you can think about all of our different platforms like our content platform or AR platform, has different ways to, of course, increase engagement, but also monetize this core communications use case that we provide. And we actually think providing this place for friends and family to communicate, it's only become more important as more and more platforms focus on public social media style features where people feel like they have to compete for popularity, compete for likes and comments. It's never been more important to actually build deeper relationships with your friends and family. And that's really the key utility that Snapchat provides. So anywhere that we can play to that strength, we can really build momentum. So, for example, with Spotlight, one of the ways we've been able to drive more viewership and time spend is through enabling better sharing of content between friends. People love to share videos with their friends and laugh about them or share a video that makes them think of somebody that they care about. And we've been able to use that to drive more spotlight engagement over time. I think similarly with MyAI, we saw a real opportunity to play to our strength in communication to provide more utility with an AI chatbot, but also improve business performance by using those intent signals, which historically we'd have to infer, we'd have to guess what people were interested in based on the content they are watching or ads they were engaging with. And with MyAI we can use very clear intent signal to better rank and optimize content across our platform, AR experiences and, of course, advertising as well. So I think we continue to occupy a really special place for supporting relationships between friends and family, and we've really built our business around that over time.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session as well as Snap Inc.'s second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Thank you for attending today's session. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Derek Andersen",
            "content": "Hey, it's Derek speaking. Thanks for the question. And you're right. I'd note that we've not provided formal guidance since the very beginning of 2022. So it is a big shift for us to begin providing formal guidance again. And I think that does reflect an increased confidence in the trajectory of our business. We've historically, I think when we've approached thinking about guidance, one of the things that we've tried to do is make sure that we're reasonably including at the top end, the attainable upside that we see in the business. And then on the downside, making sure that we're including the reasonably visible and quantifiable downside on that side. So, as we enter Q3, the business is in a period of rapid transition as we invest to drive improved performance on our ad platform. You'll note that we've ramped investment in infrastructure really rapidly to support monetization as well as the depth of content engagement and my AI, each of which is or will be a key input to monetization over time. And given the progress we're seeing there, we're pretty excited and encouraged. We've seen active advertisers up 20% year-over-year, higher active advertiser retention year-over-year and a more than 30% lift in purchase-related conversions. So, we're increasingly confident that these investments are a key input to sustain revenue growth over time. That said, how the continued ramp in these investments will impact the ad platform performance, advertiser demand and topline growth in the immediate weeks and months ahead is more difficult to predict with precision. In addition, forward visibility of advertising demand remains somewhat limited. We've seen continued strength with verticals such as CPG and restaurants and travel. Well, we've got some other sectors that continue to face challenges that are unique to their sector or the macro environment and therefore, make forward visibility on advertising demand, a little bit more difficult or challenging to calibrate, especially in a quarter is typically somewhat back-end weighted. So, for Q3, the guidance range calls for a range of between negative 5% and flat on a year-over-year growth basis. And we think this reasonably includes the attainable upside and all of these risk we see that could possibly drive us towards the low end. So, I hope that is a good set of context for how we think about guidance generally, given we haven't done it for a while and how we arrived at it specifically for this quarter. Thanks for the question. I'll turn it over for the other one. Hi, it's Derek. Thanks for that question. So first noted, the investments we're making in the near-term here in infrastructure are substantial. We've been making investments into a number of areas. And so I'll break that down for you a little bit.

            "name": "Jerry Hunter",
            "content": "Hey Mark, this is Jerry. Thanks for the question. Let me just kind of give you a little bit of history on what's going on here. We had a small number of customers who were adversely impacted by those changes that we made. They were mostly concentrated in North America, and that's why you'll see the disruptive impact of those changes are most pronounced in North America. But one of the things to note is that the advertisers who were impacted over half of them have recovered their spend to prior levels in previous years. And so we've made a lot of progress with that. We're learning about what it takes to make these advertisers successful and we're working with those remaining advertisers to get them back to that level as well. I do feel pretty confident or comfortable about the direction we're taking. As Derek mentioned, we are seeing more active advertisers and it's a diverse set of advertisers, the number of active advertisers is up 20% year-over-year. And we are -- most importantly, I think we're seeing more spending year-over-year in advertiser spending on lower funnel optimization, which is where we've been spending a lot of our time. Let me also just kind of give you a sense about what we're doing to increase share of wallet and grow the space, grow demand. A year ago when we restructured the team and reprioritized this business, we've got in this very experienced leadership team to drive more operational focus, and I'm pretty excited about the work that's happening here. First leader that joined was Ronan Harris, and we're seeing some very good progress in EMEA. Ajit Mohan joined shortly after that, and you'll see that we're seeing progress in APAC. We've got a couple of hires that I'm pretty excited about. We've started working in their space as Rob Wilk joined recently in the Americas and Patrick Harris is overseeing our global partnership space, and they're starting to take action in their teams. So, as we look into the second half, the core focus is accelerating revenue. And what we're starting to see, let's see, we've improved processes for bringing in new clients or prospecting processes, and we know that our ad platform updates are giving major new opportunities for these new clients in addition to these -- our top clients of old. We launched several go-to-market process improvements, which are showing positive results, both in increased share of wallet with existing customers and growth relative to market verticals that we're operating in. A couple of other things we're doing. We're systematically improving the implementation of our ad products. That means a systematic and scale program for understanding advertiser objectives, ensuring that they've got the right implementation on the signals we need for their campaigns, making sure that their campaigns are set up successfully and then just working with them, iterating with them, which is, again, where we've seen success with the existing customers that are back to previous spend. We're also working on automating those steps so we can make sure these are easier for advertisers going forward. So this is just a few of the things that we're doing to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the go-to-market space that I think is going to bring more customers and more demand to the space. Thanks for that question."

            "name": "Evan Spiegel",
            "content": "Hi everyone and thank you all for joining us. We began the second quarter of 2023 with a strong focus on growing our community, accelerating our revenue growth, and leading in augmented reality. Our community grew to 397 million daily active users in Q2, and we are working to deepen engagement with our content platform, with the number of content viewers and total time spent watching content increasing globally year-over-year. Our focus on visual communication between friends and family is a strategic advantage that has enabled us to build engaging and retentive products and services across our platform. To achieve a higher rate of revenue growth, we are focused on three key priorities. First, investing in our products to sustain community growth and deepen engagement. Second, investing heavily in our direct response business to deliver measurable return on spend for our advertising partners. Third, cultivating new sources of revenue to diversify our topline growth to build a more resilient business. We generated revenue of $1,068 million in Q2, a decrease of 4% year-over-year and an increase of 8% quarter-over-quarter. In Q1 of this year, we made changes to our ad platform to unify the ad experience across our service and retrained our models to drive more in-session click-through conversions. In Q2, we made progress toward improving results for advertisers through machine learning model updates and infrastructure improvements, new ways of measuring and optimizing advertising spend, and new leadership for our go-to-market efforts. We are encouraged to see that this progress is beginning to translate into improved results with record active advertisers in Q2, up more than 20% year-over-year, and through improved advertiser retention compared to the same time period last year. We made progress diversifying our revenue through Snapchat+, our subscription service that offers exclusive, experimental, and pre-release features, which now has more than 4 million subscribers. We are excited about the early progress we are making with AR Enterprise Services, our first SaaS offering, which helps retailers use our augmented reality platform to drive sales and reduce returns on their own applications and websites. We also rolled out My AI globally, and we recently began early testing of sponsored links in conversations with My AI. Diversifying our revenue growth is an important strategic initiative and we believe our leadership in messaging and AR technology provides a strong foundation to help connect businesses to our large and engaged community. We are calibrating our investment levels to build a path to free cash flow break-even or better, even with reduced rates of revenue growth. We will continue to invest with a long-term perspective, especially in areas that are critical to realizing the long-term opportunity of augmented reality. While our strategic investments in cloud-based ML infrastructure have put downward pressure on margins in the short-term, there are early signs that the improvements to ranking and personalization of our content and ad platforms are leading to deeper engagement with content by our community and stronger returns on investment for our advertising partners. We have further scrutinized our operating costs in order to invest incrementally only where it is necessary to achieve our strategic priorities and in particular to drive top line revenue acceleration. Last year we reorganized our team, reprioritized our business initiatives, and laid out our strategy to reaccelerate revenue growth by investing in community growth and engagement, improving our direct response advertising business, and diversifying the sources of our revenue. While we are still far from achieving the revenue growth to which we aspire, we believe that the momentum we have established in community growth and content engagement, the significant improvements we are seeing in return on investment for direct response advertisers, and the early growth of Snapchat+ to more than 4 million subscribers, demonstrate progress and further validate our strategic focus. Thank you, and with that we will begin our Q&A session. Hey Rich, thanks so much for the question. We've always been clear that we're building Snap for the long-term. And that means that we really have to strike the right balance between growing and optimizing the business we have today and also planting seeds for future growth. And that's really core to how we've evolved from being a simple messenger to a diversified platform with engagement across our map, augmented reality and, of course, content and stories and spotlight. As you know, engagement is a fundamental input to monetization on Snapchat, which is why we're focused on innovation. It's really the only way we've been able to compete with companies that are far bigger than we are, the way we've been able to grow to more than 750 million people using our service around the world. And sometimes these new products are monetizable immediately, but oftentimes, as we grow engagement, they become monetizable in the future. And this was definitely the case for our content business and, of course, for our AR platform as well. So when we confronted the rapidly changing economic environment a year ago, we made the difficult decision to sunset up some products that hadn't yet reached scale and we reduced the size of our team by approximately at 20%. And as I mentioned, we support a community of more than 75 0 million people as well as our advertising partners and content partners, and we do that with a team of about 5,000 people. So on a revenue per headcount basis, I think you could make the case that we should actually invest more, especially given the size of our long-term opportunity, but we wanted to really thoughtfully manage our cash flow and dilution because financing costs have increased and our share price has trended lower. So things like spectacles or AR enterprise services, for example, build on core investments that we're making today in our AR platform. That's driving revenue and engagement on Snapchat right now. And that really represents a focused way to build on our core strengths by investing in longer-term initiatives that are technically complex and more difficult to replicate. So by building on those core strengths in AR, we're able to make long-term focused investments more efficiently because these efforts represent an extension of our core platform rather than totally new bets. So of course, from a headcount perspective, while I wish we could invest more in some of our more long-term initiatives. I think we have the right balance for where we're at today. And we really need to accelerate near-term revenue growth will simultaneously setting up the business to sustain that revenue growth over the longer term. So fortunately, we've got a balance sheet to navigate this challenging period. So we don't have to sigabite our longer-term opportunity as we tackle some of the shorter-term headwinds. Hey Tom, thanks so much for the question. We're really excited about the progress we're making on our DR tools. Obviously, over the last year, a huge priority for us has been signal restoration. So, creating solutions like conversions, API that advertisers can integrate to pass back signals in a privacy safe way. I'd tell you, our focus right now is really more on the go-to-market side because what we're finding is when advertisers have integrated our solutions and configure them correctly, they're really able to drive strong results. And this is especially the case with e-commerce and pixel purchase where we're seeing some strong momentum. So, what we've been trying to do is scaled out with our go-to-market efforts. So, for example, we released a new dashboard for our team to be able to make sure that advertisers are sharing signals correctly in a privacy safe way. That's helping us find these configuration errors that if we can correct can lead to much stronger results for advertising partners, and we're definitely taking a more consultative approach with clients as well. So, I think for e-commerce advertisers and purchase-related conversions, we're seeing a lot of progress there. On the app side, there's still some work to do, and that will be a big focus for us in the back half of the year. Scan will be a piece of that, but there are tools like value optimization, for example, where app advertisers want to be able to optimize against users, they think we'll spend a lot of money in their app, for example. And we don't offer that level of fine grain optimization today. So app will be a priority for us. But I think the good news is we're seeing some real momentum on the e-commerce side and the work we've done to update our models and focus on click-through conversions is really -- is delivering strong results for advertisers. So think of it as go-to market is key for our e-commerce focused advertisers. And then on the app side, there's a little more work to do, but we've got a clear path to getting there by the end of the year. Thanks so much for the question about Spotlight and our content business. We're really excited about the trends that we're seeing. Obviously, globally, content viewers and content time spend continue to grow meaningfully, and Spotlight has been a big driver of that, reaching 400 million monthly active users in the quarter with time spent up 3x year-over-year. So we're definitely excited by that momentum. In the US specifically, the trends we've seen are essentially friend stories, viewership is trending better than we had forecast. So the rate at which the viewership decline is happening has slowed. And at the same time, we're seeing some real momentum with Spotlight. So I'm not sure in aggregate, if we flip positive yet, I think we're getting closer which is really exciting and the trends are moving in the right direction. So globally, a lot of momentum in content in the US as well, a combination of friend stories performing better than we had expected and then Spotlight and crater stories driving a lot of momentum for us. Yes. I guess, I can chat a little bit about our regional presidents. So Jerry doesn't have to pick a favorite. Ronan has been in the role of the longest started about nine months ago overseeing EMEA. He's made a lot of progress and really identified much better ways for us to go to market there. We've been taking those learnings, actually and applying them around the world. Jeet is now leading our business in APAC. He's been here not quite as long as Ronan but been here for a bit. And Rob just started in the Americas in Q2. So I think we've got a bit of work to do in the Americas. Rob has been making changes to quickly building out vertical plans to really understand where the opportunity is. And of course, spending time with a couple of the advertisers who've not yet returned to prior levels of spend. I think the reasons are pretty varied as we kind of dig into that bucket. And in some cases, there are advertisers with competitors who have who are actually ramping their spend considerably and seeing much better performance than they ever saw before. So we've really been trying to debug on a case-by-case basis and make sure advertisers have adopted our solutions correctly. But I think more importantly, as we look forward, building a more diversified base of advertisers because we're focusing on these lower funnel goals is going to be really important for our business. And I know Rob is thinking a lot about how to build out the torso of our advertisers because we do -- we have seen a lot of success with this more focused strategy in the Americas, but it's clear we also need to diversify our advertiser base. So I know that will be a real priority for the team. But I think just taking a step back, it's been really exciting to get this regional focus on our business more broadly, not just in terms of revenue, but also in terms of user growth and partnership and of course, everything we're doing on the content side. So seeing that focus translated into results has been really gratifying in EMEA and APAC, and we'll be excited to hopefully return to growth in North America soon. Yes. Thanks so much for the question. We're really excited about this unique role we play in the market, connecting friends and family with visual communication. And we use our strength in that very frequent visual communication to build other businesses around it. So you can think about all of our different platforms like our content platform or AR platform, has different ways to, of course, increase engagement, but also monetize this core communications use case that we provide. And we actually think providing this place for friends and family to communicate, it's only become more important as more and more platforms focus on public social media style features where people feel like they have to compete for popularity, compete for likes and comments. It's never been more important to actually build deeper relationships with your friends and family. And that's really the key utility that Snapchat provides. So anywhere that we can play to that strength, we can really build momentum. So, for example, with Spotlight, one of the ways we've been able to drive more viewership and time spend is through enabling better sharing of content between friends. People love to share videos with their friends and laugh about them or share a video that makes them think of somebody that they care about. And we've been able to use that to drive more spotlight engagement over time. I think similarly with MyAI, we saw a real opportunity to play to our strength in communication to provide more utility with an AI chatbot, but also improve business performance by using those intent signals, which historically we'd have to infer, we'd have to guess what people were interested in based on the content they are watching or ads they were engaging with. And with MyAI we can use very clear intent signal to better rank and optimize content across our platform, AR experiences and, of course, advertising as well. So I think we continue to occupy a really special place for supporting relationships between friends and family, and we've really built our business around that over time."

With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Evan.\nEvan Spiegel: Hi, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. We began the year with an intense focus on growing our community, accelerating our revenue growth and leading in augmented reality. Our community continues to grow, reaching 383 million daily active users in Q1 and we are working to deepen engagement with our content platform while building innovative new features and services. Our focus on visual communication between friends and family has distinguished our platform from other Internet platforms. And in Q1, we built on this core offering with the introduction of My AI, our new AI-powered chat box. At our Annual Snap Partner Summit, we made My AI available to Snapchatters around the world and launched a range of new features, including the ability to add My AI to a conversation with friends, offer place recommendations from the Snap Map and suggest more relevant AR lenses. We are excited about the opportunities we see for more innovation, especially as we look across our application at how AI can further enhance the Snapchatter experience. We are working to accelerate our revenue growth, and we are using this opportunity to make significant improvements to our advertising platform to help drive increased return on investment for our advertising partners. We generated revenue of $989 million in Q1, an increase of 7% year-over-year, which was within the forecast range we shared entering the quarter. As expected, demand in Q1 was disrupted by the changes we made to our ad platform to drive more click-through conversions. While these changes are disruptive in the short-term, we are optimistic that our ad platform improvements are laying the foundation for future growth. We believe that delivering stronger return on ad spend for our advertising partners will enable us to increase our share of wallet over time in this highly competitive environment. We made progress diversifying our revenue through Snapchat+, our subscription service that offers exclusive experimental and pre-release features, which now has more than 3 million subscribers. We are excited about the launch of AR Enterprise Services with our first SaaS offering called Shopping Suite, which helps retailers use our augmented reality platform to drive sales and reduce returns on their own applications and websites. Diversifying our revenue growth is an important strategic initiative, and we believe our leadership in AR technology provides a strong foundation to build Enterprise Services and deliver a more holistic solution for businesses who are already using our AR technology for advertising. Despite the challenging operating environment this quarter, we continue to make progress on our path to sustainable profitability by achieving adjusted EBITDA of $1 million and generating $103 million of free cash flow in Q1. As we enter Q2, we reflect on the progress we have made in transforming our business to succeed in an operating environment that has been shaped by platform policy changes and more challenging macroeconomic environment and an intensely competitive landscape. We began this transition with the reprioritization of our business last summer to focus on growing our community and deepening engagement, diversifying and accelerating our revenue growth and leading an augmented reality. As a part of the reprioritization, we took decisive actions to reduce our cost structure, and we are pleased to share that we achieved the cost reduction targets we set in Q3 of last year. With our new COO structure, which unified our engineering, sales and product teams, we have brought in three regional presidents across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC. With Ronan Harris leading EMEA; Ajit Mohan leading APAC; and our newest hire, Rob Wilk, leading the Americas. We have also brought in several new engineering and product leaders to accelerate progress with our advertising platform. As this structure has improved coordination and prioritization across each of these teams, we have identified clear opportunities to further invest in our business. For example, we've uncovered opportunities to make targeted investments in ML infrastructure to improve our recommendation systems for content and ads, and we have identified areas for incremental go-to-market investments that we believe will help us to accelerate revenue growth. Given the progress we have made with our ad platform, the experienced leadership team we have built, the work we have done to reprioritize our cost structure, and the strength of our balance sheet, we believe that we are now well-positioned to responsibly invest in the acceleration of our topline revenue. While there is still a lot of work to be done, we believe that our large and growing community, track record of innovation and the changes we have made to drive focus will enable us to make the right investments for our business and realize the long-term growth opportunity we see ahead. Thank you. And with that, we will begin our Q&A session.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] The first question is from the line of Mark Shmulik with Bernstein. You may proceed.\nJenny Liang: Hi, this is Jenny on behalf of Mark Shmulik. Two questions, if we may. Firstly, the investment you've made to build out DR was always going to hurt revenue in the short run. How confident are you that the benefit is still there? And when do you expect to see it? And what markers should we be looking out for? And then secondly, we've heard from appear just how much short-form video lifted time spent overall. Any color that you could share on how spotlight and creator stories is contributing to total time spend? Thank you.\nEvan Spiegel: Yes. Just taking a step back, we've done a lot of work over the last nine months to improve our advertising business, of course, starting with the organizational changes we made appointing Jerry as our Chief Operating Officer and hiring three new leaders across each of our regions. We've also hired a ton of strong leaders across monetization engineering and revenue product as well. And so it's been really great to bring that experience into the organization. And obviously, bringing all these leaders together, reporting to Jerry has really helped everyone get aligned on our strategy. So, we've been making a lot of progress improving the platform. A lot of the early work was really focused on signal recovery using privacy safe integrations like Cappy, for example, which we've discussed at length previously. We've also done a lot of work to improve the Post click experience with ads, which is made easier for Snapchatters to convert on platform and really help close the gap between the first-party and third-party metrics reporting, which is really important for advertiser trust. And then in the quarter, we also rolled out a new 70 pixel purchase offering for advertisers who want to bid against that objective. But the biggest change overall that we made in the quarter that was the most disruptive was really the transition to click-based ad interactions across our different advertising formats and then the retraining of our models against those clicks. So prior to these changes, ad interactions across the different content formats, like Spotlight and stories were different, which made a lot more confusing for our community to interact with ads on Snapchat. So, for example, in stories, people use a horizontal swipe to move to the next story and then a vertical swipe to open the ad. But on Spotlight, people use a vertical swipe to navigate to the next piece of content and then a tap to open the ad. And so now with these changes across stories and Spotlight, we have quick-based interactions with ads, which has moved us a lot closer to unifying our overall content experience. And then, of course, we have been retraining our models against these new ad interactions. So there are some early green shoots like the growing number of active advertisers, which leads to more advertiser diversity and higher retention of advertisers, which is an important input to long-term growth. But I think maybe more importantly, all of these changes have laid the groundwork for us to invest more in running bigger models, with more data and of course, accelerating the rate of experimentation on our ad platform, which is super important and why we're ramping up our investment in cloud infrastructure to improve our ranking system. So I think your second question was on Spotlight time spent. We're super excited about the progress we're making with Spotlight, we're now reaching 350 million monthly active users on Spotlight. Time spend is up 170% year-over-year. So that's a really exciting growth area for our business.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rich Greenfield with LightShed Partners.\nRich Greenfield: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I got a couple. I guess, given the infrastructure and creator investments that feel pretty vital to reversing the pressure you've seen on engagement in advertising, I guess the question is sort of why aren't you scaling back your AR investments? You talked about off-site partnerships, and I saw last week, things like AR Coke machines or vending machines, like why not scale back AR investments until you're in a better financial position? Obviously, it feels like meta has got the luxury of sort of walking and chewing gum, when I look at like their metaverse investment. I'm not sure you have that luxury. So how do you think about -- how do you balance sort of what you need to reaccelerate your core business versus sort of investing in the future. And then two, I guess, just sort of high \u2013 a big picture question, Evan of just -- obviously, you've got but now is going to be another quarter of revenue declines at least based on your internal forecast in Q2. What gives you confidence that you can return to robust growth? Because I think, obviously, the big challenge here is investor confidence in you and the team.\nDerek Andersen: Hey, Rich, it's Derek speaking. I'm going to start here, and then I'm going to kick it to Evan at the end to expand a little bit. I think you step back on the cost structure, as we discussed at our recent Investor Day, we remain committed to balancing our investments and our growth over time and to the generation of adjusted EBITDA profitability and free cash flow over time as well. As part of that commitment, we took a significant action in Q3 of last year and over the course of the last two quarters to reprioritize our cost structure significantly, and we set a goal to remove $500 million from our cash cost structure in order to create a path to adjusted EBITDA profitability and positive free cash flow, even at reduced rates of growth. And as we noted in our letter, we actually exceeded the $500 million goal. In Q1 of this year, we realized $533 million in cash cost structure reductions. And that effort cleared the path for us to deliver adjusted EBITDA profitability and more than $100 million in free cash flow in Q1 despite the 7% decline in revenue year-over-year. So while we're pleased to achieve those outcomes that made such a difficult quarter for our top line, we believe that the best path to delivering sustained profitability and free cash flow generation over time lies in accelerating our top line growth and better capturing our ARPU opportunity. So, for example, the investments we're making in ML infrastructure to support our ad platform, the ML investments to deepen monetizable content engagement and the investments to develop my AI as a new input to understanding user interest and intent are all laser-focused on helping accelerate the top line. Similarly, the investments we're making in the Creator stories program, which you noted, were much smaller in scale are deepening monetizable engagement, and we've been pleased to see this drive really significant growth in impression inventory over the last two quarters. So you're correct, these investments are collectively expected to put downward pressure on gross margins and adjusted EBITDA profitability in the near term. But we believe these investments will be substantially accretive over time and a critical input to sustain free cash flow generation and growth from there over time. In other words, our internal forecast for Q2 is not intended to mark a shift in our financial discipline and instead is part of what we see as the path to resuming growth and generation of sustained free cash flow. And then in terms of prioritizing our investments to manage our cost structure, I think, we really are fortunate that we made significant reductions already over the last six months. And then the work that we've done over a longer period of time to build a strong balance sheet such that we can make these investments in the very near term to drive growth in a responsible way. I think the last thing if turn it over to Evan is just simply that we're going to measure the performance of these investments carefully and they're only going to persist in our cost structure to the extent that they're productive over any reasonable time frame.\nEvan Spiegel: Thanks so much for the question. I think as we look at our longer-term opportunity, the thing that really energizes us is just the strength of our community and their engagement. We now reach over 750 million monthly active users. And then we continue to innovate at a really rapid pace, I think, most recently with My AI, which is, I think, a really compelling extension to the messaging experience that people have on Snapchat. I think more tactically speaking, if you look at the influx of really strong leaders that we now have on the ad side and the ad platform improvements that we're making, that gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to accelerate revenue growth and -- and it's why we have the confidence to make the investments that Derek mentioned, which I think are going to be really important to moving quickly here. So I think just looking more broadly at the community and their engagement, we've never been more excited about our opportunity to really serve our community and, of course, realize the long-term potential of our business.\nOperator: The next question is from Michael Morris with Guggenheim. Please proceed.\nMichael Morris: Thanks. Appreciate it. A couple of questions on AI. I guess, first, I'd be interested if you can share any early takes from the My AI distribution. I realize it's only been a week or so since it was a little out more broadly, but would be curious what you've seen from your user base as it pertains to the engagement with the product. And then second, just maybe to expand on what was asked previously, but the broader question of the role of AI and the different functions of the company driving engagement, helping advertisers with creative. Can you share more details on kind of the time frame to having that kind of functionality available and maybe, how you view competition with some of the larger players in the space that are clearly working very hard on this to keep engagement on their own platforms? Thank you.\nEvan Spiegel: Yes, of course. So maybe I'll just talk a little bit about the way that we use AI across several core pieces of our business. So I think the three sort of major areas are, of course, messaging, augmented reality and then content/ads. And so for a very long time, we've used AI in our ranking system for content and ads. It's really been the core driver of engagement growth for us. And we're going to continue to invest there, including with new and bigger models. And of course, I think we have a lot of the inputs we need to succeed there in terms of spotlight submissions, for example, and of course, the audience and the growth we have in time spent and Spotlight, which allows us to explore a lot more content for ranking. So I think, we're going to continue our momentum on the content and ad side. In augmented reality, we've seen AI play a really important role in new lens experiences, for example, our ML-driven lenses have driven a lot of engagement for SAP. And then, as we look at the longer-term future of augmented reality, we think that the intersection of AR and AI is going to really provide a much more compelling user interface for things like spectacles into the future. So that's a big research area for us. And then on the messaging side, we're really excited about conversational AI, because it really plays to our strength as a messaging platform. And we're finding that in addition to talking to friends and family all day long on Snapchat, people really enjoy communicating with My AI. So don't have any specific stats to share with you just yet, but we've been managing the rollout really carefully to make sure that the experience is fast despite some of the capacity constraints we're bumping up against. But we're being thoughtful and deliberate with the rollout. We're really excited to get it out to our entire community and we're really pleased with the engagement so far.\nOperator: Next question is from Lloyd Walmsley with UBS.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thanks. Two, if I can. First, just like, what inning are you guys in kind of rolling out the DR shift to last click in terms of just educating advertisers, training the models and kind of how do you rank the importance of getting that right to drive the faster growth? And then second one, I wanted to follow up on that last question on My AI, like how much do you see this providing you guys with more signal for advertising versus simply driving more engagement? Like, is that a meaningful opportunity for you guys? Anything you can share on early data from that and how you can kind of leverage that for monetization? Thanks.\nJerry Hunter: Hi Lloyd. Thanks for that question. This is Jerry and I'll take that first question, and I'll hand it over to Evan for the second. For where we are on the DR changes, I mean, we went through a pretty major evolution on the platform. And as we mentioned in the letter, we're making progress across the three areas, investing in observability and measurement, improving the engagement and the quality of the conversions and increasing that volume pipe quality engagements and conversions. We think that the big model and UI changes that we made are behind us, but we're still working through some impacts and making some steady progress. We're also going to always be shipping improvements to the platform, but we expect that these future changes are going to be more incremental and less disruptive. On the importance of educating advertisers versus training the models is really both. What we've learned from these larger advertisers that we've worked with through this transition is a manager actually finding success now. We work with them to get to a place where they were finding positive ROI and then there's a few that we're still working with to get through the change to get them to positive ROI.\nEvan Spiegel : In terms of My AI, our primary focus right now is really on the community experience and trying to drive a lot of value for folks who are using My AI. Of course, the intent signal we get can be used to improve relevance of content or AR experiences, and that's definitely something we're working hard on. My AI can recommend places now and of course, recommend lenses. We're really excited to see folks engagement there. We are doing some early experimentation around monetization, including things like sponsored links, and I think the team will have more to share at our upcoming new funds presentation.\nOperator: The next question is from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\nUnidentified Analyst : Hey. This is Katie on for Doug. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to dive deeper into some of the monthly revenue feeding. I believe you called out that March was up 21% month-over-month. So I'm just curious if you're seeing real uptick in demand for the course of the quarter, or is that more a function of easier comps with lapping potentially Russia and Ukraine a year ago. And then just curious if you're seeing any of that improvement continue into April so far. Thanks.\nDerek Andersen: Hey, Derek speaking. I'll take that one. And I think maybe it makes sense to step back and just talk about the journey for Q1 and then what we're seeing into our internal forecast for Q2. On the macro side, well, the macro environment appears to have stabilized. It's stabilized at a much weaker level compared to where we were, for example, a year ago. We continue to be impacted by the platform policy changes and the tough competitive environment as well. In Q1 specifically, as we shared in our letter, the changes we made to our ad platform were disruptive. And while some advertisers have already recovered to prior levels, and while some new advertisers are finding success under these changes. There are a small number of our top advertisers that have not recovered, and this continues to be a headwind to demand as we start making our way into Q2. So while we're pleased with the progress we're seeing from many of our advertisers, there are, in many cases, growing off a smaller base, and it will take time for this more diverse base of smaller advertisers to drive the overall top line. In addition, we are concerned as we enter Q2 that there are some advertisers who rely on Lift studies that are provide measurement signals on a delayed basis. And then this could cause disruption in their spending in Q2 as they experience the initial impact of the changes we made in Q1 on a more delayed basis. Our internal forecast for Q2, therefore, reflects these challenges as well as the investments we're making to accelerate our progress towards improving our ad platform. Importantly, we are seeing sequential progress in the business. As we noted in the letter, month-over-month growth in March, for example, was 21%. And this was roughly in line with the seasonality month-over-month that we saw in 2021 and was well ahead of what we observed in 2022, although I know 2022 was impacted by the onset of the war in Ukraine. In addition, our internal forecast calls for at the midpoint 5% quarter-over-quarter growth, which is further demonstration of our expectation that we'll see more sequential progress for the business as we navigate the changes. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of an understanding of the topography of what we saw in Q1 and how we expect that to transition into the new quarter.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks. Thank you, Derek. One is you've done a really nice job driving gross margin in the past few years. As you laid out in the letter, there's a couple of factors may make a tough this year. Can you give me a sense of where you think gross margins bottom out in the near term is to dimension it for us. And then you just mentioned that last answer about some small number of advertisers who have not yet returned to prior spending levels, what's causing that issue? And what alleviates that headwind to improve that situation? Thanks.\nEvan Spiegel: Sure. So starting on the gross margins. I think one of the things that\u2019s challenging here, obviously, is that especially over any long period of time, gross margins are going to be impacted significantly by the top line revenue growth rate and in particular, top line revenue growth rate relative to our investments in infrastructure and so on. So I would say it starts with expectations around revenue on the top line. What we tried to do here though is, give you an understanding of where we are investing on the cost of revenue side and some magnitude to help you model out and sensitize where gross margins might have. So, specifically, one really big component, the largest component of cost of revenue is infrastructure cost per DAU. We shared in the letter that we expected sequentially that's likely to rise $0.08 to $0.12 off of the $0.59 base that we saw in the current. And that's really reflective of the significant investments we're looking at for ML infrastructure. The largest portion of that is designed specifically to drive optimization and performance of the ad platform. A smaller minority share of that, but still significant, is investments in ML to drive depth of engagement on the content platform. And of course, that drives directly into monetizable content and top line as well. And then a smaller minority portion is the investment in My AI, which again is directly attributable to contributing to the top line in the form of better understanding of user interest and intent. So, I think, in terms of other aspects of what's happening in cost of revenue and gross margins, over the last two quarters, we've taken an annualized $84 million out of fixed content cost, that's a little over $20 million a quarter. And we saw that benefit come on over the course of Q4 and then into Q1. And so, that's been offsetting the cost of the creator rev share program over the last couple of quarters. As we start to lap those fixed cost investments reduction, sorry, in the back half of this year and hopefully continue to see great success with that creator story program, that will put a little bit of new pressure on those margins in the back half of the year, assuming continued success there. But importantly, that program is rev share based and therefore, scales with monetization. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of a sense of what's happening with gross margins and an ability to sort of think about how that will move with revenue over time. And then I think in terms of what we're seeing on top advertisers over the quarter, you've got advertisers who performed exceptionally well under the prior paradigm. As Jerry laid out earlier, we made a number of changes to the ad platform and folks who are particularly sophisticated prior to those are going to take time to recover and become equally sophisticated under the new ad unit, design and interaction design, as well as tweaking their models to perform in a new environment, and that's not something that's going to happen quickly. But we're working hard with those partners to help them with signal and modeling and development and performance and all of the investments that we're pouring into our ML infrastructure again are intended to contribute to that recovery. So, hopefully, that gives you a sense for how that's evolving.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Tom Champion with Piper Sandler.\nTom Champion: Hi, good afternoon. Derek, curious if you could just talk about your advertising verticals and the pockets of strength and where it's weaker and how you're working with clients to build kind of relevant tools by vertical? Thank you.\nDerek Andersen: Sure. I think actually, I might ask Jerry to step in on that one. I mean we've seen a continuation of strength in some of the same verticals we've been talking about for a few quarters, but you can probably talk a little bit more about some of the work that we're doing to support specific verticals under the new ad changes?\nA \u2013 Jerry Hunter: I mean, yeah, largely, we're working with advertisers on Cappy and making sure that we're collecting information and signals. We're also orienting both the sales force as well as our product team that actually works with customers to work directly with these customers and build tooling that helps them find the performance that they're looking for. And so we're doing these customer by customer, and we've seen some positive -- some very positive signals from some of these customers, where we've gotten that to get to a stronger ROAS post changes. We also have a bunch of other customers we're working with directly to improve their ROAS.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session as well as Snap Inc.'s First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for attending today's session. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Hey, Rich, it's Derek speaking. I'm going to start here, and then I'm going to kick it to Evan at the end to expand a little bit. I think you step back on the cost structure, as we discussed at our recent Investor Day, we remain committed to balancing our investments and our growth over time and to the generation of adjusted EBITDA profitability and free cash flow over time as well. As part of that commitment, we took a significant action in Q3 of last year and over the course of the last two quarters to reprioritize our cost structure significantly, and we set a goal to remove $500 million from our cash cost structure in order to create a path to adjusted EBITDA profitability and positive free cash flow, even at reduced rates of growth. And as we noted in our letter, we actually exceeded the $500 million goal. In Q1 of this year, we realized $533 million in cash cost structure reductions. And that effort cleared the path for us to deliver adjusted EBITDA profitability and more than $100 million in free cash flow in Q1 despite the 7% decline in revenue year-over-year. So while we're pleased to achieve those outcomes that made such a difficult quarter for our top line, we believe that the best path to delivering sustained profitability and free cash flow generation over time lies in accelerating our top line growth and better capturing our ARPU opportunity. So, for example, the investments we're making in ML infrastructure to support our ad platform, the ML investments to deepen monetizable content engagement and the investments to develop my AI as a new input to understanding user interest and intent are all laser-focused on helping accelerate the top line. Similarly, the investments we're making in the Creator stories program, which you noted, were much smaller in scale are deepening monetizable engagement, and we've been pleased to see this drive really significant growth in impression inventory over the last two quarters. So you're correct, these investments are collectively expected to put downward pressure on gross margins and adjusted EBITDA profitability in the near term. But we believe these investments will be substantially accretive over time and a critical input to sustain free cash flow generation and growth from there over time. In other words, our internal forecast for Q2 is not intended to mark a shift in our financial discipline and instead is part of what we see as the path to resuming growth and generation of sustained free cash flow. And then in terms of prioritizing our investments to manage our cost structure, I think, we really are fortunate that we made significant reductions already over the last six months. And then the work that we've done over a longer period of time to build a strong balance sheet such that we can make these investments in the very near term to drive growth in a responsible way. I think the last thing if turn it over to Evan is just simply that we're going to measure the performance of these investments carefully and they're only going to persist in our cost structure to the extent that they're productive over any reasonable time frame. Hey, Derek speaking. I'll take that one. And I think maybe it makes sense to step back and just talk about the journey for Q1 and then what we're seeing into our internal forecast for Q2. On the macro side, well, the macro environment appears to have stabilized. It's stabilized at a much weaker level compared to where we were, for example, a year ago.

            "content": "Hi Lloyd. Thanks for that question. This is Jerry and I'll take that first question, and I'll hand it over to Evan for the second. For where we are on the DR changes, I mean, we went through a pretty major evolution on the platform. And as we mentioned in the letter, we're making progress across the three areas, investing in observability and measurement, improving the engagement and the quality of the conversions and increasing that volume pipe quality engagements and conversions. We think that the big model and UI changes that we made are behind us, but we're still working through some impacts and making some steady progress. We're also going to always be shipping improvements to the platform, but we expect that these future changes are going to be more incremental and less disruptive. On the importance of educating advertisers versus training the models is really both. What we've learned from these larger advertisers that we've worked with through this transition is a manager actually finding success now. We work with them to get to a place where they were finding positive ROI and then there's a few that we're still working with to get through the change to get them to positive ROI."

            "name": "Evan Spiegel",
            "content": "Hi, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. We began the year with an intense focus on growing our community, accelerating our revenue growth and leading in augmented reality. Our community continues to grow, reaching 383 million daily active users in Q1 and we are working to deepen engagement with our content platform while building innovative new features and services. Our focus on visual communication between friends and family has distinguished our platform from other Internet platforms. And in Q1, we built on this core offering with the introduction of My AI, our new AI-powered chat box. At our Annual Snap Partner Summit, we made My AI available to Snapchatters around the world and launched a range of new features, including the ability to add My AI to a conversation with friends, offer place recommendations from the Snap Map and suggest more relevant AR lenses. We are excited about the opportunities we see for more innovation, especially as we look across our application at how AI can further enhance the Snapchatter experience. We are working to accelerate our revenue growth, and we are using this opportunity to make significant improvements to our advertising platform to help drive increased return on investment for our advertising partners. We generated revenue of $989 million in Q1, an increase of 7% year-over-year, which was within the forecast range we shared entering the quarter. As expected, demand in Q1 was disrupted by the changes we made to our ad platform to drive more click-through conversions. While these changes are disruptive in the short-term, we are optimistic that our ad platform improvements are laying the foundation for future growth. We believe that delivering stronger return on ad spend for our advertising partners will enable us to increase our share of wallet over time in this highly competitive environment. We made progress diversifying our revenue through Snapchat+, our subscription service that offers exclusive experimental and pre-release features, which now has more than 3 million subscribers. We are excited about the launch of AR Enterprise Services with our first SaaS offering called Shopping Suite, which helps retailers use our augmented reality platform to drive sales and reduce returns on their own applications and websites. Diversifying our revenue growth is an important strategic initiative, and we believe our leadership in AR technology provides a strong foundation to build Enterprise Services and deliver a more holistic solution for businesses who are already using our AR technology for advertising. Despite the challenging operating environment this quarter, we continue to make progress on our path to sustainable profitability by achieving adjusted EBITDA of $1 million and generating $103 million of free cash flow in Q1. As we enter Q2, we reflect on the progress we have made in transforming our business to succeed in an operating environment that has been shaped by platform policy changes and more challenging macroeconomic environment and an intensely competitive landscape. We began this transition with the reprioritization of our business last summer to focus on growing our community and deepening engagement, diversifying and accelerating our revenue growth and leading an augmented reality. As a part of the reprioritization, we took decisive actions to reduce our cost structure, and we are pleased to share that we achieved the cost reduction targets we set in Q3 of last year. With our new COO structure, which unified our engineering, sales and product teams, we have brought in three regional presidents across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC. With Ronan Harris leading EMEA; Ajit Mohan leading APAC; and our newest hire, Rob Wilk, leading the Americas. We have also brought in several new engineering and product leaders to accelerate progress with our advertising platform. As this structure has improved coordination and prioritization across each of these teams, we have identified clear opportunities to further invest in our business. For example, we've uncovered opportunities to make targeted investments in ML infrastructure to improve our recommendation systems for content and ads, and we have identified areas for incremental go-to-market investments that we believe will help us to accelerate revenue growth. Given the progress we have made with our ad platform, the experienced leadership team we have built, the work we have done to reprioritize our cost structure, and the strength of our balance sheet, we believe that we are now well-positioned to responsibly invest in the acceleration of our topline revenue. While there is still a lot of work to be done, we believe that our large and growing community, track record of innovation and the changes we have made to drive focus will enable us to make the right investments for our business and realize the long-term growth opportunity we see ahead. Thank you. And with that, we will begin our Q&A session. Yes. Just taking a step back, we've done a lot of work over the last nine months to improve our advertising business, of course, starting with the organizational changes we made appointing Jerry as our Chief Operating Officer and hiring three new leaders across each of our regions. We've also hired a ton of strong leaders across monetization engineering and revenue product as well. And so it's been really great to bring that experience into the organization. And obviously, bringing all these leaders together, reporting to Jerry has really helped everyone get aligned on our strategy. So, we've been making a lot of progress improving the platform. A lot of the early work was really focused on signal recovery using privacy safe integrations like Cappy, for example, which we've discussed at length previously. We've also done a lot of work to improve the Post click experience with ads, which is made easier for Snapchatters to convert on platform and really help close the gap between the first-party and third-party metrics reporting, which is really important for advertiser trust. And then in the quarter, we also rolled out a new 70 pixel purchase offering for advertisers who want to bid against that objective. But the biggest change overall that we made in the quarter that was the most disruptive was really the transition to click-based ad interactions across our different advertising formats and then the retraining of our models against those clicks. So prior to these changes, ad interactions across the different content formats, like Spotlight and stories were different, which made a lot more confusing for our community to interact with ads on Snapchat. So, for example, in stories, people use a horizontal swipe to move to the next story and then a vertical swipe to open the ad. But on Spotlight, people use a vertical swipe to navigate to the next piece of content and then a tap to open the ad. And so now with these changes across stories and Spotlight, we have quick-based interactions with ads, which has moved us a lot closer to unifying our overall content experience. And then, of course, we have been retraining our models against these new ad interactions. So there are some early green shoots like the growing number of active advertisers, which leads to more advertiser diversity and higher retention of advertisers, which is an important input to long-term growth. But I think maybe more importantly, all of these changes have laid the groundwork for us to invest more in running bigger models, with more data and of course, accelerating the rate of experimentation on our ad platform, which is super important and why we're ramping up our investment in cloud infrastructure to improve our ranking system. So I think your second question was on Spotlight time spent. We're super excited about the progress we're making with Spotlight, we're now reaching 350 million monthly active users on Spotlight. Time spend is up 170% year-over-year. So that's a really exciting growth area for our business. Thanks so much for the question. I think as we look at our longer-term opportunity, the thing that really energizes us is just the strength of our community and their engagement. We now reach over 750 million monthly active users. And then we continue to innovate at a really rapid pace, I think, most recently with My AI, which is, I think, a really compelling extension to the messaging experience that people have on Snapchat. I think more tactically speaking, if you look at the influx of really strong leaders that we now have on the ad side and the ad platform improvements that we're making, that gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to accelerate revenue growth and -- and it's why we have the confidence to make the investments that Derek mentioned, which I think are going to be really important to moving quickly here. So I think just looking more broadly at the community and their engagement, we've never been more excited about our opportunity to really serve our community and, of course, realize the long-term potential of our business. Yes, of course. So maybe I'll just talk a little bit about the way that we use AI across several core pieces of our business. So I think the three sort of major areas are, of course, messaging, augmented reality and then content/ads. And so for a very long time, we've used AI in our ranking system for content and ads. It's really been the core driver of engagement growth for us. And we're going to continue to invest there, including with new and bigger models. And of course, I think we have a lot of the inputs we need to succeed there in terms of spotlight submissions, for example, and of course, the audience and the growth we have in time spent and Spotlight, which allows us to explore a lot more content for ranking. So I think, we're going to continue our momentum on the content and ad side. In augmented reality, we've seen AI play a really important role in new lens experiences, for example, our ML-driven lenses have driven a lot of engagement for SAP. And then, as we look at the longer-term future of augmented reality, we think that the intersection of AR and AI is going to really provide a much more compelling user interface for things like spectacles into the future. So that's a big research area for us. And then on the messaging side, we're really excited about conversational AI, because it really plays to our strength as a messaging platform. And we're finding that in addition to talking to friends and family all day long on Snapchat, people really enjoy communicating with My AI. So don't have any specific stats to share with you just yet, but we've been managing the rollout really carefully to make sure that the experience is fast despite some of the capacity constraints we're bumping up against. But we're being thoughtful and deliberate with the rollout. We're really excited to get it out to our entire community and we're really pleased with the engagement so far. In terms of My AI, our primary focus right now is really on the community experience and trying to drive a lot of value for folks who are using My AI. Of course, the intent signal we get can be used to improve relevance of content or AR experiences, and that's definitely something we're working hard on. My AI can recommend places now and of course, recommend lenses. We're really excited to see folks engagement there. We are doing some early experimentation around monetization, including things like sponsored links, and I think the team will have more to share at our upcoming new funds presentation. Sure. So starting on the gross margins. I think one of the things that's challenging here, obviously, is that especially over any long period of time, gross margins are going to be impacted significantly by the top line revenue growth rate and in particular, top line revenue growth rate relative to our investments in infrastructure and so on. So I would say it starts with expectations around revenue on the top line.

Please refer to our filings with the SEC to understand how we calculate any of the metrics discussed on today's call. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Evan.\nEvan Spiegel: Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. In Q3, we continued to make progress on our core priorities of growing our community and improving depth of engagement, driving top-line revenue growth and diversifying our revenue sources and building toward our long-term vision for augmented reality. Daily active users reached 443 million in Q3, an increase of 37 million year-over-year. We continue to deepen engagement with our content platform with a number of content viewers and total time spent watching content growing year-over-year. The progress we have made with our direct response advertising business and the growth of our Snapchat+ subscription business contributed to total revenue increasing 15% year-over-year to $1.37 billion. We continue to make meaningful progress with our lower-funnel DR business as total active advertisers more than doubled year-over-year in Q3. In an effort to grow our lower-funnel DR business faster, we are innovating on our advertising products, investing in machine learning and evolving the way we go to market to better serve our advertising partners. We hosted our Annual Snap Partner Summit in Q3, bringing together partners, creators and lens developers to introduce a number of new initiatives. We announced a new and simplified version of Snapchat that we believe will further our initiative to grow our community and deepen engagement. We also announced two new ad placements, Sponsored Snaps and Promoted Places, that will provide incremental reach to our advertising partners as they engage with Snapchatters across our service. To further our vision for augmented reality computing, we launched the fifth generation of Spectacles, our AR glasses powered by Snap OS, and introduced a series of generative AI innovations for our AR developer platform. Developers are already building amazing lenses, and we can't wait to see the new experiences they create for our community. We believe the rapid pace of innovation set by our team demonstrates the impact of a leaner organizational structure that is more focused on our core strategic priorities. The benefits of our more focused set of priorities is also evident in our financial results, where we have cleared a path to generate meaningful adjusted EBITDA profitability and positive free cash flow, both of which are critical stepping stones to future GAAP profitability. In Q3 specifically, the combination of top-line progress and expense discipline translated to $132 million of adjusted EBITDA and $72 million of free cash flow. Moving forward, we will continue to calibrate our investments carefully to build on our top-line momentum, while realizing the operating leverage necessary to drive improved financial performance. In Q3, we introduced a new and simplified version of Snapchat, organized into three core experiences focused on communicating with friends, using the camera and watching entertaining content. For Snapchatters, this updated layout offers a more personal, relevant and easy-to-use interface. For Creators, Simple Snapchat unlocks greater discovery and enhances the ability for content to reach new audiences. Currently, there are approximately 10 million Snapchatters using Simple Snapchat across dozens of countries. Broadly speaking, Simple Snapchat is driving the greatest content engagement games among more casual users, which is an important input to community growth and advertising inventory. We are seeing particularly positive impacts on Android devices, including increased time spent with content, increased story views and more replies to friends' stories, which is an important conversation starter that helps foster close relationships. We are also seeing an increase in content active days on iOS, but the impacts to other top engagement metrics are not yet as broadly positive as on Android, due in part to the differences in engagement across these platforms. We are encouraged by this early progress as it reinforces our conviction that this user experience will further our goals of inspiring creation, enhancing communication and delivering a more engaging content experience. We recognize that any significant change in user experience brings risk of disruption to our community and advertising business. Further, the impact on engagement may vary as we expand our testing to new cohorts. As a result, we will be intently focused on testing and iterating in the months ahead to optimize the experience for our community and our business. We continue to make meaningful progress in growing our global community, reaching 443 million daily active users in Q3, an increase of 11 million quarter-over-quarter. Daily active users in North America were 100 million, approximately flat year-over-year, but up quarter-over-quarter as our initiatives to increase user engagement begin to show early signs of progress. Daily active users in Europe was 99 million compared to 97 million in the prior quarter and 95 million in the prior year. DAU in Rest of World was 244 million compared to 235 million in the prior quarter and 211 million in the prior year. Snapping with friends and family is the core of our service and the primary driver of the continued growth and long-term retention of our global community. In Q3, we introduced new AI-enabled features to inspire creation, spark conversations and help our communities strengthen their relationships through Snapping. For example, we introduced AI in Snapchat Memories, which enables Snapchatters to share AI-generated collages and video mash-ups with friends. In addition, we announced an expanded strategic partnership with Google Cloud to leverage the multimodal capabilities of Gemini on Vertex AI to power Snapping with My AI, our AI-powered chatbot. In Q3, the number of Snaps sent to My AI in the US more than tripled quarter-over-quarter. Our content platform continues to strengthen relationships on Snapchat with a number of people sharing Spotlight content with friends up more than 60% year-over-year in Q3. To further deepen content engagement, we are investing in our ML models to improve ranking and personalization. In Q3, we enhanced our Spotlight recommendation system to better represent each Snapchatter's interests and references based on historical signals, launched models optimized for new Snapchatters and deployed multimodal ML models to improve recognition of video, text and audio and content submitted by creators. To expand our content supply, we are focused on growing our creator community by supporting them with content creation tools and monetization opportunities. In Q3, we began testing a new AI video generation tool that enables creators to generate engaging videos with a simple text or image prompt. Our efforts to support creators have contributed to the number of creators posting content growing approximately 50% year-over-year in Q3. The combined impact of these initiatives have helped to drive improvements in global time spent watching content, which increased 25% year-over-year and 6% quarter-over-quarter in Q3. In North America, time spent watching content was relatively stable, down 1% year-over-year, while increasing 2% quarter-over-quarter. The relatively higher rate of growth outside North America is due in part to the greater mix of content viewing being driven by Spotlight in these regions, as Spotlight reach and depth of engagement continues to grow rapidly across all regions. Augmented reality continues to inspire creation and drive engagement on Snapchat. More than 375,000 AR creators, developers, and teams from nearly every country in the world have built over 4 million Lenses. For example, our Past and Future Me AI Lens, which enables Snapchatters to transform into their younger and older self, was viewed over 650 million times in Q3. To build on this momentum, we created a number of generative AI capabilities in Lens Studio, including Easy Lens, a new GenAI tool that makes it possible to create an AR experience within minutes. We are also rolling out a slate of new GenAI Suite features in Lens Studio, including new animation tools that automatically blend different animations together to easily generate full 3D characters. The response to our new tools in Lens Studio has been inspiring and reinforces our belief that long-term success in AR requires a vibrant developer and creator ecosystem. We believe our efforts to build a global AR ecosystem are critical to enabling new experiences brought to life through Spectacles. In Q3, we introduced the fifth generation of Spectacles, our see-through, standalone AR glasses that enable developers to use AR Lenses and experience the world together with friends in new ways. Spectacles are powered by Snap OS, our new operating system designed to reflect how people naturally interact, with their hands and voice. Spectacles enable developers to create immersive AR experiences, interact with My AI, browse the internet, or lay out multiple screens to get work done anywhere. AR developers and partners are already creating AR experiences for Spectacles, including BRICKTACULAR BY The LEGO Group, and Peridot, a friendly and unique AR pet from Niantic. We aspire to be the most developer-friendly platform in the world, and we are excited to offer our new generation of Spectacles to developers as an invitation and inspiration to create new experiences. Looking ahead, we are focused on innovating and enhancing our core product experience while continuing to invest in the future of augmented reality. We believe continued progress on these initiatives is a critical input to serving our community and expanding our long-term monetization opportunity. We continued to make progress on three foundational advertising platform initiatives, including better and larger ML models, improved privacy-safe signals, and more performant ad formats in order to deliver improved campaign performance for our advertising partners. The expansion of 7-0 optimization to app install and app purchase is driving better performance for advertisers with early results showing cost-per-install decreasing 24% and cost-per-purchase decreasing 27% compared to 28-1 optimization. For example, Nexters, an international game development company and creator of hit title \"Hero Wars\u201d, leveraged 7-0 optimization for app install and app purchase and saw a 19% increase in installs with an 18% lower cost-per-install and 56% increase in purchases at a 36% lower cost-per-purchase. Recently, we introduced our new Landing Page View optimization goal to help advertisers drive high-quality traffic to their websites. Through improvements in our ML models that optimize for this specific objective, we observed lower cost for some advertisers versus traditional click engagement models. For example, with the guidance of their digital agency Tinuiti, Wrangler leveraged Landing Page View optimization and saw a 34% increase in CPM efficiency and a 380% increase in conversions, leading to a 212% higher ROAS compared to previous benchmarks. The combination of more performant DR products, go-to-market operations optimized for SMB customers, and easier onboarding and integration tools are helping to rapidly expand our SMB customer base. As a result of these efforts, total active advertisers more than doubled year-over-year in Q3. Today, with our Snap Promote offering, SMBs and creators alike can promote their services, content or products, reach new audiences, and measure ad performance, all within Snapchat on their mobile devices. We also continue to enhance the advertiser onboarding experience by personalizing and automating the buying process from end-to-end so that SMBs can optimize their campaigns faster and enhance performance. Recently, we launched automated in-flight campaign recommendations, adaptive templates for campaign set-up, and scaled creative editing to further improve our go-to-market strategy for SMBs. For example, US-based cookie franchise Crumbl leveraged our new 7-0 optimization for app install and app purchase and completed their CAPI integration, resulting in a 32% quarter-over-quarter increase in ROAS and a 242% quarter-over-quarter increase in purchases. We are also focused on reaccelerating upper-funnel Brand revenue growth by delivering innovative and performant advertising products, while supporting Brands and Agencies with resources and unique insights. In Q3, we launched First Lens Unlimited, which offers advertisers the first impression of the day in the first slot of their AR Lens Carousel, allowing them to reach our community at greater scale. During testing, First Lens Unlimited drove an average increase of over 35% in incremental impressions for advertising partners. We also launched State-specific First Story, which allows US advertisers to target First Story takeover campaigns to individual states or to reach the entire country with different creative for each state. We are also experimenting with two new ad placements: Sponsored Snaps and Promoted Places. Importantly, both of these placements are designed to leverage our existing full-screen vertical video Snap Ad format so that advertisers can automate placement across our service without having to develop bespoke creatives. Sponsored Snaps will empower advertisers to communicate visually with the Snapchat community, making the core functionality of Snapchat accessible to advertisers. Promoted Places enables businesses to use the Snap Map to suggest sponsored places of interest to Snapchatters. Sponsored Snaps and Promoted Places will help businesses reach Snapchatters in engaging ways across our differentiated service and we believe these new ad placements will contribute meaningful incremental advertising inventory over time. We are on track to launch Sponsored Snaps and Promoted Places in certain geographies in Q4. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Derek to discuss our financial results.\nDerek Andersen: Thanks, Evan. In Q3, total revenue was $1.37 billion, up 15% year-over-year and 11% quarter-over-quarter. Advertising revenue was $1.25 billion, up 10% year-over-year, driven primarily by growth from DR advertising revenue, which increased 16% year-over-year. DR ad revenue growth was driven by continued strong demand for our 7-0 pixel purchase optimization that was up more than 160% year-over-year, as well as a growing contribution from App Purchase optimization. Brand-oriented advertising revenue was down 1% year-over-year as we continued to see weak demand from certain consumer discretionary verticals, including technology, entertainment and retail. We continue to make progress toward diversifying our revenue sources with other revenue more than doubling year-over-year to reach $123 million in Q3. Other revenue includes all non-advertising revenue, the majority of which is Snapchat+ subscription revenue, and Snapchat+ subscribers more than doubled year-over-year to exceed 12 million in Q3. In Q3, North America revenue grew 9% year-over-year, with the relatively lower rate of growth in this region due to the impact of weaker Brand-oriented demand being relatively concentrated in North America. Europe revenue grew 24% year-over-year, as continued progress on our DR ad platform fully offset the impact of more challenging prior year comparisons. Rest of World revenue grew 32% year-over-year, driven by the continued progress with our DR ad platform. Global impression volume grew approximately 19% year-over-year, driven in large part by expanded advertising delivery within Spotlight and Creator Stories. Total eCPMs were down approximately 7% year-over-year as inventory growth exceeded advertising demand growth in Q3. Adjusted cost of revenue was $637 million in Q3, up 16% year-over-year. Infrastructure costs were the largest driver of the year-over-year increase, due in large part to the ramp in ML and AI investments over the past year. Infrastructure cost per DAU was $0.84 in Q3, which is up from $0.81 in the prior quarter, and within our expected range of $0.83 to $0.85. The remaining components of adjusted cost of revenue were $263 million in Q3, or 19% of revenue, which is in line with the prior quarter and at the lower end of our full year cost structure guidance range of 19% to 21%. Adjusted gross margin was relatively stable at 54% in Q3, up from 53% in the prior quarter, but in line with 54% in the prior year. Adjusted operating expenses were $604 million in Q3, up 1% year-over-year. Personnel costs decreased 9% year-over-year, driven by an 11% year-over-year decline in full-time headcount. This was partially offset by higher marketing costs related to our ongoing More Snapchat campaign, as well as the impact of our Snap Partner Summit, which occurred in Q3 this year compared to Q2 in the prior year. Increases in legal related costs year-over-year, including the impact of complying with an increasingly complex global regulatory environment, were also a key factor in offsetting lower personnel costs in Q3. Adjusted EBITDA was $132 million in Q3, up from $40 million in Q3 of the prior year, reflecting higher revenue and operating expense discipline. Adjusted EBITDA flow-through, or the share of incremental year-over-year revenue that flowed through to adjusted EBITDA, was 50% in Q3, as we continue to carefully prioritize our investments to drive top-line growth and deliver improved financial performance. Net loss was $153 million in Q3, compared to a net loss of $368 million in Q3 of the prior year. The $215 million or 58% improvement in net loss year-over-year largely reflects the flow-through of a $92 million improvement in adjusted EBITDA, a $94 million or 26% reduction in stock-based compensation and related expenses, and the impact of $19 million of restructuring costs in the prior year. The reduction in SBC, to $266 million in the current quarter, reflects reduced headcount and the diminished impact of refresh equity grants relative to the prior year. Free cash flow was $72 million in Q3 while operating cash flow was $116 million. Over the trailing 12 months, free cash flow was $147 million and operating cash flow was $347 million, as we continue to balance investments with top-line growth to deliver sustained positive cash flow. Dilution, or the year-over-year growth in our share count, was 0.6% in Q3, down from 1.9% in the prior quarter. We ended Q3 with $3.2 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand and no debt maturing in the current year, which reflects our ongoing commitment to maintaining a conservative balance sheet with ample liquidity for our operations. As we enter Q4, we anticipate continued growth of our global community and our Q4 guidance is built on the assumption that DAU will be approximately 451 million in Q4. We are excited about the potential for Simple Snapchat, Sponsored Snaps, and Promoted Places to contribute to top-line growth over time. In particular, we are encouraged by early testing results that show content engagement gains among less frequently engaged users of Snapchat as we believe this can be an important input to impression growth and incremental reach for advertisers. While we believe growth in content engagement and demand for the new ad placements may build over time, many of the changes associated with Simple Snapchat occur immediately as Snapchatters transition to the new user experience, which presents the risk of near-term disruption. While we do not currently anticipate a broad roll-out of Simple Snapchat in our most highly monetized markets until Q1 at the earliest, we have now begun limited testing in these markets and may further expand this testing as we move through Q4. In addition, upper-funnel advertising from large enterprise clients has historically been an important component of demand in Q4, and this portion of the business has been underperforming our overall ads business in recent quarters. Given these factors, our Q4 guidance range for revenue is $1.51 billion to $1.56 billion, implying year-over-year revenue growth of 11% to 15%. From a cost structure perspective, we are tracking well against our full year cost structure guidance. For infrastructure, our guidance was for quarterly costs of $0.83 to $0.85 per DAU. We hit the mid-point of this range in Q3, and with growing ML and AI capacity utilization being partially offset by the benefit of recent pricing improvements, we anticipate being nearer the top end of this range in Q4. For all other cost of revenue, our guidance range was 19% to 21% of revenue. We came in at the low end of this range in Q3, and anticipate being within the range again in Q4. For adjusted operating expenses, we provided full year guidance of $2.425 billion to $2.525 billion. In Q3, our annualized run rate was consistent with the low end of this range, and with modest sequential growth forecasted for Q4, we expect to be near the low end of the range for the full year. For SBC and related expenses, we guided for a range of $1.13 billion to $1.2 billion for the full year. In Q3, the annualized run rate of our SBC expense was below the low end of this range. We anticipate modest sequential growth in SBC expense in Q4 and, therefore, anticipate we will come in 4% to 5% below the low end of our guidance range for the full year. Given the revenue range above and the progress we have made to optimize our cost structure, we estimate that adjusted EBITDA will be between $210 million and $260 million in Q4. Given the strength of our balance sheet, our progress towards sustained free cash flow generation, and our desire to opportunistically manage our share count for the benefit of our long-term shareholders, we have authorized a new share repurchase program in the amount of $500 million. As we move forward, we will remain focused on prioritizing our investments carefully to drive top-line growth alongside improved financial performance. Thank you for joining our call today, and we will now take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Dan Salmon with New Street Research. Your line is now open.\nDan Salmon: Okay. Great. Good afternoon, everyone. Evan, you highlighted the potential risk of Simple Snapchat transition in your comments. Derek walked through the sort of timing of testing. Both mentioned over a dozen markets and mentioned that you're being cautious on how you move testing into higher monetizing markets. So, the high level makes a lot of sense. Could you maybe take us a layer deeper on how you and the team are monitoring and managing that risk on a regular basis, including how you're ensuring you don't see a monetization headwind from the changes? Thanks.\nEvan Spiegel: Thanks, Dan. We're definitely excited about the long-term opportunity for Simple Snapchat. And that's especially with new and less engaged users where we've seen some of the biggest increases in content engagement, but we definitely have a lot of work to do to iterate and test before we begin a broader rollout. So that will include things like better understanding the shifts in inventory and potential impacts to monetization. For example, we'll be working to move more of the story ad delivery into interstitial placements rather than tile-based ads in the current Discover feed. So, certainly changes of scale have the potential to be disruptive, which is why we're taking this test-and-learn approach. And ultimately, we really want our community and our partners to benefit from these changes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rich Greenfield with LightShed Partners. Your line is now open. Rich, your line is now open.\nRich Greenfield: Sorry about that. Just want to follow-up on Simple Snapchat. When you said you started to roll it out in some major markets this quarter, have you done that in the US, UK, France, Germany, like some of your big ad markets? The reason I ask is, obviously, the product looks great. It's driving engagement, but I think what we're all trying to understand is, are you willing to take some near-term disruption revenue wise next year to rollout the superior product, or will you wait until it's a revenue-neutral shift to wait to roll it out? Like, we're just trying to understand what will happen to make you roll it out more broadly if that makes sense?\nEvan Spiegel: Thanks, Rich. Yeah, we're still early in the journey on understanding the monetization dynamics and some of those inventory shifts and how that could impact revenue. We certainly want to take the time to work through those sorts of changes and make sure advertisers and our partners, for example, are prepared for those sorts of changes. So, all that to say I think it's pretty early right now. And while we are excited about some of the engagement shifts we've seen with new and less engaged users, we're going to take our time to really understand the monetization dynamics and work through some of those changes. So, our goal is really to take our community and our partners along for that journey and so we're going to keep testing and learning here and potentially even explore something like a phased rollout, for example, over an extended period of time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nJustin Post: Great. Thank you. Just wanted to ask about Sponsored Snaps and Promoted Places. I know you mentioned you're pretty excited about the long-term opportunity. Can you help us just understand the usage those services get and how you're thinking about inserting ads and how that could look for you in the very long term? Thank you.\nEvan Spiegel: Thanks, Justin. Yeah, we're really excited about these two new ad placements that will really be leveraging the foundation we built for performance advertising over the past couple of years with really the vision that Snap Ads can be fungible across many different placements across Snapchat that leverage the unique and differentiated ways that our community engages across our platform. I think in the case of Promoted Places, we've gotten some great early feedback. We've run some initial tests, although I think it's a bit too early to share the data there. But in general, we're just seeing a lot of businesses really focused on driving more people in-store into their retail locations to try and strengthen that customer relationship. I think many brands are feeling like they've been disintermediated with their digital relationship with customers. And so, being able to bring people into their retail establishments and really strengthen that relationship with their customers is something that's important to them. So, the feedback there has been great. And we have some Sponsored Snap tests forthcoming in the quarter. So, once we have some more data back there, we'll be eager to share that as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nKen Gawrelski: Thank you. Appreciate it. Want to ask, when you think about the key objectives for the simplified app launch, when you think about the opportunities and engagement versus monetization, if you could kind of weigh the two and if there's one that kind of is more important than the other? And the second one is, how do you think of -- what will it take to get advertisers to spend more broadly, not only always on, which is more of a direct response or SME behavior, but also spend kind of give you a budget and allow you to allocate across the different products and services on Snap, which we've seen to be very successful at both Google and Meta? Thank you.\nEvan Spiegel: Yeah. Thanks, Ken. I think, as we look at the evolution with Simple Snapchat, our North Star has always been creating the best possible product experience for our community, and a product experience that they really love. I think there are some challenges today, as we've innovated over the years and created all these new ways to engage, with Snapchat, the app has become quite complex. And even basic things like watching Stories or watching Spotlight, that's something that people have to do in two different screens right now. And so, being able to unify the content experience I think is something that's going to be a really important step in the right direction for us. Same goes for content discovery, for example. I think today the tile-based content discovery is just not as effective as full-screen content discovery. And so, I think that's a big opportunity that will not only benefit folks using Snapchat, but also creators who are working really hard to reach our audience with really compelling content. So I think, in general, this North Star of our community and, of course, our partners like creators is really important to us. And then, what we found is that, that over the over the long term, tends to create more opportunity for advertising partners as well, as they're able to reach our audience through these different parts of our service. So, I think, the North Star is going to be the community engagement and then thinking about how we can best manage this transition so that our advertising partners and our content partners can benefit from it as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Shmulik with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. I'm [Louisa] (ph) speaking on behalf of Mark Shmulik. So, I have a question -- we have a question on Spotlight engagement. Is Spotlight viewership behavior outside of North America different? Can you provide some more color on that?\nEvan Spiegel: We've seen really strong growth in Spotlight engagement globally. I think North America, as we shared in the letter, we've essentially been offsetting some declines with the Stories content engagement, while we've seen growth in Spotlight. So, I think you're just seeing a bit of a mix shift there. But overall, the growth of Spotlight and the depth of engagement has been a big driver of content view time growth for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Heaney with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nJames Heaney: Great. Thank you for taking the question. Can you talk about the results that you're seeing from the new app install product? And what needs to happen for app install clients to become a more meaningful driver of your top-line results? And then, just curious if you can comment on the revenue growth that you're seeing so far in Q4 that helped inform your 11% to 15% guide. Thank you.\nDerek Andersen: Hey there, James. It's Derek speaking. Thanks for the question. On the app side, I think one of the things that we've seen as an ongoing trend is that we sort of walked new optimizations and products through the process of testing with initial existing clients on a limited basis, getting to a point where we can see really good results for those customers, and then expanding that and go to market, evangelizing those results and driving broader adoption, which tends to then lead to general availability and then eventually a bigger contribution to the actual revenue growth over time. So, if I look in particular over this year, in Q3, we saw app purchase optimization start to become a growing contributor to the top-line growth. So that's something that we launched much earlier in the year. It went through that testing phase and expansion in go to market and now is becoming a contributor, which is wonderful to see. If we think about app install and app purchase, those are things that we extended our 7-0 optimization framework to, and we've seen clear performance improvements for advertisers. We've shared some case studies there. But from a metrics point of view, for example, we've seen cost per install is down 24%, and cost per purchase is down 27%. So, those are really exciting results to see for our customers and then give us results that we can evangelize to others. So, I think the key here is to keep rolling out the adoption of those, expand the testing, evangelize those results in case studies to the customer verticals where we have really good product market fit and continue to drive that through the elevation, the execution in the go to market. If we look back further, the first optimization on the rebuild of the DR business that we rolled out well more than a year ago was the 7-0 Pixel Purchase optimization. And that's really one that's gone through the entire evolution of the launch, test, evangelize, and grow, and we saw that up a 160% year-over-year in the most recent quarter. So, hoping to drive continued results there and build on the momentum that we have with the overall DR business. Thanks for the question. Hopefully, that helps. When we're thinking about the -- your other question around the guide into Q4 and what's informing that, obviously, Q4 has historically been a pretty back-end weighted quarter, and so, limited -- to read through to the back half is always challenging. I think one of the things we're focused on is the momentum that we're seeing in different parts of the business. So, I just talked a lot about the DR business. We're focused on continued execution there, continued [healthy] (ph) adoption, continued rollout of the app optimizations and client performance. On the Brand side, we're not expecting any significant recovery there. We've been down 1% year-over-year in each of the last two quarters, not anticipating a major shift there as we go into Q4. And obviously, that's an important component of revenue in the final quarter of the year. Our product execution is the key that we're focused on there in terms of igniting growth long term. So, you did see us rollout some product optimizations the most recent quarter, including First Lens Unlimited, which allows our advertisers to reach folks with the first impression of the day and the first slot in the Lens Carousel. That's seeing some really nice early results, drove 30% -- 35% actually, increase in incremental impressions. And we also launched the State-specific First Story, which is a product that allows advertisers to, target individual creative to specific states or to target the entire country with different creative for different states. So there's a lot of product innovation going in there, and that's the key to improving that growth over the longer term, but not expecting a big improvement on the Brand side in particular in Q4. So those are some of the dynamics we're seeing that alongside the very limited testing of Simple Snapshot that are informing the range there. And hopefully, that gives you a little color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shweta Khajuria with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nShweta Khajuria: Thank you so much for taking my question. I guess, regarding top-line growth, so when you think about the trajectory of your revenue growth and excluding, I guess, Snapchat+ subscription, just the advertising growth, what gives you most confidence in your ability to deliver faster than overall digital ad market growth? I mean, you have a lot of product initiatives going on from CAPI integrations ongoing with app optimizations and then the announcements that you had during your Partner Summit, and that includes Simple Snapchat and Sponsored Snaps and Promoted Places, even if that takes a little bit longer, in your mind for monetization. So, could you help us think through how -- what gives you confidence as you think about maybe near to midterm in terms of ad revenue growth? Thank you.\nDerek Andersen: Hey, there, it's Derek speaking. I think the answer here is multilayered. To start, I think over the long term, we are most focused on the execution of the direct response business and specifically the lower-funnel DR business in terms of rolling our product optimizations. And then, and on top of that, we're very focused on growing the small- and medium-sized customer segment and making sure that we build on the momentum there. So, if I talk through each one of those, I'd say there's a multilayered approach here, where we're executing against a number of different initiatives to be able to drive that sustained and higher rate of growth on that -- those components of the business. So specifically, first is the continued ongoing buildout of the ML and AI architecture at the company that feeds into our ability to have better personalization and recommendation of ads, getting the right ad in front of the right person. We continue to make progress on having more signals coming into the platform and harvesting more of the privacy safe signals that exist on the platform, getting more of that harnessed into much larger models and our ability to refresh those more frequently. Then, you can see the steady drumbeat of us delivering, rolling out, and then optimizing new goals for advertisers. We talked earlier about the really strong growth we're seeing with 7-0 Pixel Purchase, how we rolled that out and extended that framework to some of the app objectives and how that's starting to deliver growth. And then, go to market efforts, on all client sizes, to basically deliver those optimizations to folks where we have great product market fit. One of the muscles that we're really learning to build here is go to market on SMC, and there's a lot of learnings there and a lot of work to do. So, for example, we've -- number one, been able to roll out Snap Promote as a great way for advertisers to get started with just a couple of clicks right in the app. So, the lowest friction way to get started. We've also, for folks using Ad Manager, made it a lot easier for them to very quickly onboard there, get started with automated recommendations, for campaign setup and optimization. And then, we're getting very good at integration partners there that are helping us not only drive direct, where we've made it much easier to do direct integrations with CAPI, but then we've got a long and extending list of integration partners that are making it much easier for small- and medium-sized customers to adopt CAPI and get started with that, feeding their performance with better signals and feedback loops. So, there's a lot of work to be done here. And I think the sort of simplest answer to your question is, the roadmap here is very clear. We have a lot of work to do and a lot of things to execute against. We have a very clear idea of what we need to do, and the team's pace of execution has been very solid. And so, the focus now is just to continue to execute that roadmap, deliver for our customers, and drive the results. Hopefully, that helps a little bit there.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nRoss Sandler: Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. Evan, a question on the Spectacle. So, the demo was pretty insane at the Partner Summit compared to once some of us have tried out prior versions of that product. So, I guess the question is, what level of investment and what pace or timing of when that could be a consumer product are you expecting? And then, related to that, now that we've seen what Meta is doing with Orion, how does that impact like both the investment level and the pace by which you're going to get that market to the consumer -- get the product to the consumer perhaps quicker than before or not? Just your thoughts on that would be great.\nEvan Spiegel: Thanks, Ross. Yeah, we're really excited about the progress we're making with Spectacles and it's been really exciting to share the fifth generation with so many of our partners and developers. I think right now we're just really focused on helping people build amazing lenses for Spectacles. I think one of the challenges that any new computing platform sort of faces is this chicken and egg problem of people really needing, in our case, new lens experiences to use when they first buy AR glasses. And so, by focusing on really seeding and supporting that developer ecosystem and making sure there are amazing lenses for people to use when they buy the consumer product, I think we're really focused on the key problem we need to solve in advance of widespread consumer adoption. So, we're going to stay focused there for now. It's been so exciting to see the amazing lenses people have already built in the weeks since launch. And we think there's just a huge opportunity to transform the way people use computing, grounded in the real world and together with their friends and leveraging natural interactions. And this is a vision we've been working towards for over a decade now. And so, we have some very unique assets to leverage like Lens Studio, which helps people build these really complex AR experiences and then run them in a really performant way on Lens Core that powers not just the Snapchat application, but also our Spectacles glasses. So, that alongside all of our investments in hardware and the progress we've made, just makes me really excited about where we are now and, of course, the potential to get this into customers' hands. So, we're going to stay focused on our strategy and keep executing. We're really excited to share, more with you soon.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session as well as Snap Inc.'s third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Thank you for attending today's session. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Evan. In Q3, total revenue was $1.37 billion, up 15% year-over-year and 11% quarter-over-quarter. Advertising revenue was $1.25 billion, up 10% year-over-year, driven primarily by growth from DR advertising revenue, which increased 16% year-over-year. DR ad revenue growth was driven by continued strong demand for our 7-0 pixel purchase optimization that was up more than 160% year-over-year, as well as a growing contribution from App Purchase optimization. Brand-oriented advertising revenue was down 1% year-over-year as we continued to see weak demand from certain consumer discretionary verticals, including technology, entertainment and retail. We continue to make progress toward diversifying our revenue sources with other revenue more than doubling year-over-year to reach $123 million in Q3. Other revenue includes all non-advertising revenue, the majority of which is Snapchat+ subscription revenue, and Snapchat+ subscribers more than doubled year-over-year to exceed 12 million in Q3. In Q3, North America revenue grew 9% year-over-year, with the relatively lower rate of growth in this region due to the impact of weaker Brand-oriented demand being relatively concentrated in North America. Europe revenue grew 24% year-over-year, as continued progress on our DR ad platform fully offset the impact of more challenging prior year comparisons. Rest of World revenue grew 32% year-over-year, driven by the continued progress with our DR ad platform. Global impression volume grew approximately 19% year-over-year, driven in large part by expanded advertising delivery within Spotlight and Creator Stories. Total eCPMs were down approximately 7% year-over-year as inventory growth exceeded advertising demand growth in Q3. Adjusted cost of revenue was $637 million in Q3, up 16% year-over-year. Infrastructure costs were the largest driver of the year-over-year increase, due in large part to the ramp in ML and AI investments over the past year. Infrastructure cost per DAU was $0.84 in Q3, which is up from $0.81 in the prior quarter, and within our expected range of $0.83 to $0.85. The remaining components of adjusted cost of revenue were $263 million in Q3, or 19% of revenue, which is in line with the prior quarter and at the lower end of our full year cost structure guidance range of 19% to 21%. Adjusted gross margin was relatively stable at 54% in Q3, up from 53% in the prior quarter, but in line with 54% in the prior year. Adjusted operating expenses were $604 million in Q3, up 1% year-over-year. Personnel costs decreased 9% year-over-year, driven by an 11% year-over-year decline in full-time headcount. This was partially offset by higher marketing costs related to our ongoing More Snapchat campaign, as well as the impact of our Snap Partner Summit, which occurred in Q3 this year compared to Q2 in the prior year. Increases in legal related costs year-over-year, including the impact of complying with an increasingly complex global regulatory environment, were also a key factor in offsetting lower personnel costs in Q3. Adjusted EBITDA was $132 million in Q3, up from $40 million in Q3 of the prior year, reflecting higher revenue and operating expense discipline. Adjusted EBITDA flow-through, or the share of incremental year-over-year revenue that flowed through to adjusted EBITDA, was 50% in Q3, as we continue to carefully prioritize our investments to drive top-line growth and deliver improved financial performance. Net loss was $153 million in Q3, compared to a net loss of $368 million in Q3 of the prior year. The $215 million or 58% improvement in net loss year-over-year largely reflects the flow-through of a $92 million improvement in adjusted EBITDA, a $94 million or 26% reduction in stock-based compensation and related expenses, and the impact of $19 million of restructuring costs in the prior year. The reduction in SBC, to $266 million in the current quarter, reflects reduced headcount and the diminished impact of refresh equity grants relative to the prior year. Free cash flow was $72 million in Q3 while operating cash flow was $116 million. Over the trailing 12 months, free cash flow was $147 million and operating cash flow was $347 million, as we continue to balance investments with top-line growth to deliver sustained positive cash flow. Dilution, or the year-over-year growth in our share count, was 0.6% in Q3, down from 1.9% in the prior quarter. We ended Q3 with $3.2 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand and no debt maturing in the current year, which reflects our ongoing commitment to maintaining a conservative balance sheet with ample liquidity for our operations. As we enter Q4, we anticipate continued growth of our global community and our Q4 guidance is built on the assumption that DAU will be approximately 451 million in Q4. We are excited about the potential for Simple Snapchat, Sponsored Snaps, and Promoted Places to contribute to top-line growth over time. In particular, we are encouraged by early testing results that show content engagement gains among less frequently engaged users of Snapchat as we believe this can be an important input to impression growth and incremental reach for advertisers. While we believe growth in content engagement and demand for the new ad placements may build over time, many of the changes associated with Simple Snapchat occur immediately as Snapchatters transition to the new user experience, which presents the risk of near-term disruption. While we do not currently anticipate a broad roll-out of Simple Snapchat in our most highly monetized markets until Q1 at the earliest, we have now begun limited testing in these markets and may further expand this testing as we move through Q4. In addition, upper-funnel advertising from large enterprise clients has historically been an important component of demand in Q4, and this portion of the business has been underperforming our overall ads business in recent quarters. Given these factors, our Q4 guidance range for revenue is $1.51 billion to $1.56 billion, implying year-over-year revenue growth of 11% to 15%. From a cost structure perspective, we are tracking well against our full year cost structure guidance. For infrastructure, our guidance was for quarterly costs of $0.83 to $0.85 per DAU. We hit the mid-point of this range in Q3, and with growing ML and AI capacity utilization being partially offset by the benefit of recent pricing improvements, we anticipate being nearer the top end of this range in Q4. For all other cost of revenue, our guidance range was 19% to 21% of revenue. We came in at the low end of this range in Q3, and anticipate being within the range again in Q4. For adjusted operating expenses, we provided full year guidance of $2.425 billion to $2.525 billion. In Q3, our annualized run rate was consistent with the low end of this range, and with modest sequential growth forecasted for Q4, we expect to be near the low end of the range for the full year. For SBC and related expenses, we guided for a range of $1.13 billion to $1.2 billion for the full year. In Q3, the annualized run rate of our SBC expense was below the low end of this range. We anticipate modest sequential growth in SBC expense in Q4 and, therefore, anticipate we will come in 4% to 5% below the low end of our guidance range for the full year. Given the revenue range above and the progress we have made to optimize our cost structure, we estimate that adjusted EBITDA will be between $210 million and $260 million in Q4. Given the strength of our balance sheet, our progress towards sustained free cash flow generation, and our desire to opportunistically manage our share count for the benefit of our long-term shareholders, we have authorized a new share repurchase program in the amount of $500 million. As we move forward, we will remain focused on prioritizing our investments carefully to drive top-line growth alongside improved financial performance. Thank you for joining our call today, and we will now take your questions. Hey there, James. It's Derek speaking. Thanks for the question. On the app side, I think one of the things that we've seen as an ongoing trend is that we sort of walked new optimizations and products through the process of testing with initial existing clients on a limited basis, getting to a point where we can see really good results for those customers, and then expanding that and go to market, evangelizing those results and driving broader adoption, which tends to then lead to general availability and then eventually a bigger contribution to the actual revenue growth over time. So, if I look in particular over this year, in Q3, we saw app purchase optimization start to become a growing contributor to the top-line growth. So that's something that we launched much earlier in the year. It went through that testing phase and expansion in go to market and now is becoming a contributor, which is wonderful to see. If we think about app install and app purchase, those are things that we extended our 7-0 optimization framework to, and we've seen clear performance improvements for advertisers. We've shared some case studies there. But from a metrics point of view, for example, we've seen cost per install is down 24%, and cost per purchase is down 27%. So, those are really exciting results to see for our customers and then give us results that we can evangelize to others. So, I think the key here is to keep rolling out the adoption of those, expand the testing, evangelize those results in case studies to the customer verticals where we have really good product market fit and continue to drive that through the elevation, the execution in the go to market. If we look back further, the first optimization on the rebuild of the DR business that we rolled out well more than a year ago was the 7-0 Pixel Purchase optimization. And that's really one that's gone through the entire evolution of the launch, test, evangelize, and grow, and we saw that up a 160% year-over-year in the most recent quarter. So, hoping to drive continued results there and build on the momentum that we have with the overall DR business. Thanks for the question. Hopefully, that helps. When we're thinking about the -- your other question around the guide into Q4 and what's informing that, obviously, Q4 has historically been a pretty back-end weighted quarter, and so, limited -- to read through to the back half is always challenging. I think one of the things we're focused on is the momentum that we're seeing in different parts of the business. So, I just talked a lot about the DR business. We're focused on continued execution there, continued [healthy] (ph) adoption, continued rollout of the app optimizations and client performance. On the Brand side, we're not expecting any significant recovery there. We've been down 1% year-over-year in each of the last two quarters, not anticipating a major shift there as we go into Q4. And obviously, that's an important component of revenue in the final quarter of the year. Our product execution is the key that we're focused on there in terms of igniting growth long term. So, you did see us rollout some product optimizations the most recent quarter, including First Lens Unlimited, which allows our advertisers to reach folks with the first impression of the day and the first slot in the Lens Carousel. That's seeing some really nice early results, drove 30% -- 35% actually, increase in incremental impressions. And we also launched the State-specific First Story, which is a product that allows advertisers to, target individual creative to specific states or to target the entire country with different creative for different states. So there's a lot of product innovation going in there, and that's the key to improving that growth over the longer term, but not expecting a big improvement on the Brand side in particular in Q4. So those are some of the dynamics we're seeing that alongside the very limited testing of Simple Snapshot that are informing the range there. And hopefully, that gives you a little color. Hey, there, it's Derek speaking. I think the answer here is multilayered. To start, I think over the long term, we are most focused on the execution of the direct response business and specifically the lower-funnel DR business in terms of rolling our product optimizations. And then, and on top of that, we're very focused on growing the small- and medium-sized customer segment and making sure that we build on the momentum there. So, if I talk through each one of those, I'd say there's a multilayered approach here, where we're executing against a number of different initiatives to be able to drive that sustained and higher rate of growth on that -- those components of the business. So specifically, first is the continued ongoing buildout of the ML and AI architecture at the company that feeds into our ability to have better personalization and recommendation of ads, getting the right ad in front of the right person. We continue to make progress on having more signals coming into the platform and harvesting more of the privacy safe signals that exist on the platform, getting more of that harnessed into much larger models and our ability to refresh those more frequently. Then, you can see the steady drumbeat of us delivering, rolling out, and then optimizing new goals for advertisers. We talked earlier about the really strong growth we're seeing with 7-0 Pixel Purchase, how we rolled that out and extended that framework to some of the app objectives and how that's starting to deliver growth. And then, go to market efforts, on all client sizes, to basically deliver those optimizations to folks where we have great product market fit. One of the muscles that we're really learning to build here is go to market on SMC, and there's a lot of learnings there and a lot of work to do. So, for example, we've -- number one, been able to roll out Snap Promote as a great way for advertisers to get started with just a couple of clicks right in the app. So, the lowest friction way to get started. We've also, for folks using Ad Manager, made it a lot easier for them to very quickly onboard there, get started with automated recommendations, for campaign setup and optimization. And then, we're getting very good at integration partners there that are helping us not only drive direct, where we've made it much easier to do direct integrations with CAPI, but then we've got a long and extending list of integration partners that are making it much easier for small- and medium-sized customers to adopt CAPI and get started with that, feeding their performance with better signals and feedback loops. So, there's a lot of work to be done here. And I think the sort of simplest answer to your question is, the roadmap here is very clear. We have a lot of work to do and a lot of things to execute against. We have a very clear idea of what we need to do, and the team's pace of execution has been very solid. And so, the focus now is just to continue to execute that roadmap, deliver for our customers, and drive the results. Hopefully, that helps a little bit there."

            "content": "Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. In Q3, we continued to make progress on our core priorities of growing our community and improving depth of engagement, driving top-line revenue growth and diversifying our revenue sources and building toward our long-term vision for augmented reality. Daily active users reached 443 million in Q3, an increase of 37 million year-over-year. We continue to deepen engagement with our content platform with a number of content viewers and total time spent watching content growing year-over-year. The progress we have made with our direct response advertising business and the growth of our Snapchat+ subscription business contributed to total revenue increasing 15% year-over-year to $1.37 billion. We continue to make meaningful progress with our lower-funnel DR business as total active advertisers more than doubled year-over-year in Q3. In an effort to grow our lower-funnel DR business faster, we are innovating on our advertising products, investing in machine learning and evolving the way we go to market to better serve our advertising partners. We hosted our Annual Snap Partner Summit in Q3, bringing together partners, creators and lens developers to introduce a number of new initiatives. We announced a new and simplified version of Snapchat that we believe will further our initiative to grow our community and deepen engagement. We also announced two new ad placements, Sponsored Snaps and Promoted Places, that will provide incremental reach to our advertising partners as they engage with Snapchatters across our service. To further our vision for augmented reality computing, we launched the fifth generation of Spectacles, our AR glasses powered by Snap OS, and introduced a series of generative AI innovations for our AR developer platform. Developers are already building amazing lenses, and we can't wait to see the new experiences they create for our community. We believe the rapid pace of innovation set by our team demonstrates the impact of a leaner organizational structure that is more focused on our core strategic priorities. The benefits of our more focused set of priorities is also evident in our financial results, where we have cleared a path to generate meaningful adjusted EBITDA profitability and positive free cash flow, both of which are critical stepping stones to future GAAP profitability. In Q3 specifically, the combination of top-line progress and expense discipline translated to $132 million of adjusted EBITDA and $72 million of free cash flow. Moving forward, we will continue to calibrate our investments carefully to build on our top-line momentum, while realizing the operating leverage necessary to drive improved financial performance. In Q3, we introduced a new and simplified version of Snapchat, organized into three core experiences focused on communicating with friends, using the camera and watching entertaining content. For Snapchatters, this updated layout offers a more personal, relevant and easy-to-use interface. For Creators, Simple Snapchat unlocks greater discovery and enhances the ability for content to reach new audiences. Currently, there are approximately 10 million Snapchatters using Simple Snapchat across dozens of countries. Broadly speaking, Simple Snapchat is driving the greatest content engagement games among more casual users, which is an important input to community growth and advertising inventory. We are seeing particularly positive impacts on Android devices, including increased time spent with content, increased story views and more replies to friends' stories, which is an important conversation starter that helps foster close relationships. We are also seeing an increase in content active days on iOS, but the impacts to other top engagement metrics are not yet as broadly positive as on Android, due in part to the differences in engagement across these platforms. We are encouraged by this early progress as it reinforces our conviction that this user experience will further our goals of inspiring creation, enhancing communication and delivering a more engaging content experience. We recognize that any significant change in user experience brings risk of disruption to our community and advertising business. Further, the impact on engagement may vary as we expand our testing to new cohorts. As a result, we will be intently focused on testing and iterating in the months ahead to optimize the experience for our community and our business. We continue to make meaningful progress in growing our global community, reaching 443 million daily active users in Q3, an increase of 11 million quarter-over-quarter. Daily active users in North America were 100 million, approximately flat year-over-year, but up quarter-over-quarter as our initiatives to increase user engagement begin to show early signs of progress. Daily active users in Europe was 99 million compared to 97 million in the prior quarter and 95 million in the prior year. DAU in Rest of World was 244 million compared to 235 million in the prior quarter and 211 million in the prior year. Snapping with friends and family is the core of our service and the primary driver of the continued growth and long-term retention of our global community. In Q3, we introduced new AI-enabled features to inspire creation, spark conversations and help our communities strengthen their relationships through Snapping. For example, we introduced AI in Snapchat Memories, which enables Snapchatters to share AI-generated collages and video mash-ups with friends. In addition, we announced an expanded strategic partnership with Google Cloud to leverage the multimodal capabilities of Gemini on Vertex AI to power Snapping with My AI, our AI-powered chatbot. In Q3, the number of Snaps sent to My AI in the US more than tripled quarter-over-quarter. Our content platform continues to strengthen relationships on Snapchat with a number of people sharing Spotlight content with friends up more than 60% year-over-year in Q3. To further deepen content engagement, we are investing in our ML models to improve ranking and personalization. In Q3, we enhanced our Spotlight recommendation system to better represent each Snapchatter's interests and references based on historical signals, launched models optimized for new Snapchatters and deployed multimodal ML models to improve recognition of video, text and audio and content submitted by creators. To expand our content supply, we are focused on growing our creator community by supporting them with content creation tools and monetization opportunities. In Q3, we began testing a new AI video generation tool that enables creators to generate engaging videos with a simple text or image prompt. Our efforts to support creators have contributed to the number of creators posting content growing approximately 50% year-over-year in Q3. The combined impact of these initiatives have helped to drive improvements in global time spent watching content, which increased 25% year-over-year and 6% quarter-over-quarter in Q3. In North America, time spent watching content was relatively stable, down 1% year-over-year, while increasing 2% quarter-over-quarter. The relatively higher rate of growth outside North America is due in part to the greater mix of content viewing being driven by Spotlight in these regions, as Spotlight reach and depth of engagement continues to grow rapidly across all regions. Augmented reality continues to inspire creation and drive engagement on Snapchat. More than 375,000 AR creators, developers, and teams from nearly every country in the world have built over 4 million Lenses. For example, our Past and Future Me AI Lens, which enables Snapchatters to transform into their younger and older self, was viewed over 650 million times in Q3. To build on this momentum, we created a number of generative AI capabilities in Lens Studio, including Easy Lens, a new GenAI tool that makes it possible to create an AR experience within minutes. We are also rolling out a slate of new GenAI Suite features in Lens Studio, including new animation tools that automatically blend different animations together to easily generate full 3D characters. The response to our new tools in Lens Studio has been inspiring and reinforces our belief that long-term success in AR requires a vibrant developer and creator ecosystem. We believe our efforts to build a global AR ecosystem are critical to enabling new experiences brought to life through Spectacles. In Q3, we introduced the fifth generation of Spectacles, our see-through, standalone AR glasses that enable developers to use AR Lenses and experience the world together with friends in new ways. Spectacles are powered by Snap OS, our new operating system designed to reflect how people naturally interact, with their hands and voice. Spectacles enable developers to create immersive AR experiences, interact with My AI, browse the internet, or lay out multiple screens to get work done anywhere. AR developers and partners are already creating AR experiences for Spectacles, including BRICKTACULAR BY The LEGO Group, and Peridot, a friendly and unique AR pet from Niantic. We aspire to be the most developer-friendly platform in the world, and we are excited to offer our new generation of Spectacles to developers as an invitation and inspiration to create new experiences. Looking ahead, we are focused on innovating and enhancing our core product experience while continuing to invest in the future of augmented reality. We believe continued progress on these initiatives is a critical input to serving our community and expanding our long-term monetization opportunity. We continued to make progress on three foundational advertising platform initiatives, including better and larger ML models, improved privacy-safe signals, and more performant ad formats in order to deliver improved campaign performance for our advertising partners. The expansion of 7-0 optimization to app install and app purchase is driving better performance for advertisers with early results showing cost-per-install decreasing 24% and cost-per-purchase decreasing 27% compared to 28-1 optimization. For example, Nexters, an international game development company and creator of hit title \"Hero Wars\u201d, leveraged 7-0 optimization for app install and app purchase and saw a 19% increase in installs with an 18% lower cost-per-install and 56% increase in purchases at a 36% lower cost-per-purchase. Recently, we introduced our new Landing Page View optimization goal to help advertisers drive high-quality traffic to their websites. Through improvements in our ML models that optimize for this specific objective, we observed lower cost for some advertisers versus traditional click engagement models. For example, with the guidance of their digital agency Tinuiti, Wrangler leveraged Landing Page View optimization and saw a 34% increase in CPM efficiency and a 380% increase in conversions, leading to a 212% higher ROAS compared to previous benchmarks. The combination of more performant DR products, go-to-market operations optimized for SMB customers, and easier onboarding and integration tools are helping to rapidly expand our SMB customer base. As a result of these efforts, total active advertisers more than doubled year-over-year in Q3. Today, with our Snap Promote offering, SMBs and creators alike can promote their services, content or products, reach new audiences, and measure ad performance, all within Snapchat on their mobile devices. We also continue to enhance the advertiser onboarding experience by personalizing and automating the buying process from end-to-end so that SMBs can optimize their campaigns faster and enhance performance. Recently, we launched automated in-flight campaign recommendations, adaptive templates for campaign set-up, and scaled creative editing to further improve our go-to-market strategy for SMBs. For example, US-based cookie franchise Crumbl leveraged our new 7-0 optimization for app install and app purchase and completed their CAPI integration, resulting in a 32% quarter-over-quarter increase in ROAS and a 242% quarter-over-quarter increase in purchases. We are also focused on reaccelerating upper-funnel Brand revenue growth by delivering innovative and performant advertising products, while supporting Brands and Agencies with resources and unique insights. In Q3, we launched First Lens Unlimited, which offers advertisers the first impression of the day in the first slot of their AR Lens Carousel, allowing them to reach our community at greater scale. During testing, First Lens Unlimited drove an average increase of over 35% in incremental impressions for advertising partners. We also launched State-specific First Story, which allows US advertisers to target First Story takeover campaigns to individual states or to reach the entire country with different creative for each state. We are also experimenting with two new ad placements: Sponsored Snaps and Promoted Places. Importantly, both of these placements are designed to leverage our existing full-screen vertical video Snap Ad format so that advertisers can automate placement across our service without having to develop bespoke creatives. Sponsored Snaps will empower advertisers to communicate visually with the Snapchat community, making the core functionality of Snapchat accessible to advertisers. Promoted Places enables businesses to use the Snap Map to suggest sponsored places of interest to Snapchatters. Sponsored Snaps and Promoted Places will help businesses reach Snapchatters in engaging ways across our differentiated service and we believe these new ad placements will contribute meaningful incremental advertising inventory over time. We are on track to launch Sponsored Snaps and Promoted Places in certain geographies in Q4. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Derek to discuss our financial results. Thanks, Dan. We're definitely excited about the long-term opportunity for Simple Snapchat. And that's especially with new and less engaged users where we've seen some of the biggest increases in content engagement, but we definitely have a lot of work to do to iterate and test before we begin a broader rollout. So that will include things like better understanding the shifts in inventory and potential impacts to monetization. For example, we'll be working to move more of the story ad delivery into interstitial placements rather than tile-based ads in the current Discover feed. So, certainly changes of scale have the potential to be disruptive, which is why we're taking this test-and-learn approach. And ultimately, we really want our community and our partners to benefit from these changes. Thanks, Rich. Yeah, we're still early in the journey on understanding the monetization dynamics and some of those inventory shifts and how that could impact revenue. We certainly want to take the time to work through those sorts of changes and make sure advertisers and our partners, for example, are prepared for those sorts of changes. So, all that to say I think it's pretty early right now. And while we are excited about some of the engagement shifts we've seen with new and less engaged users, we're going to take our time to really understand the monetization dynamics and work through some of those changes. So, our goal is really to take our community and our partners along for that journey and so we're going to keep testing and learning here and potentially even explore something like a phased rollout, for example, over an extended period of time. Thanks, Justin. Yeah, we're really excited about these two new ad placements that will really be leveraging the foundation we built for performance advertising over the past couple of years with really the vision that Snap Ads can be fungible across many different placements across Snapchat that leverage the unique and differentiated ways that our community engages across our platform. I think in the case of Promoted Places, we've gotten some great early feedback. We've run some initial tests, although I think it's a bit too early to share the data there. But in general, we're just seeing a lot of businesses really focused on driving more people in-store into their retail locations to try and strengthen that customer relationship. I think many brands are feeling like they've been disintermediated with their digital relationship with customers. And so, being able to bring people into their retail establishments and really strengthen that relationship with their customers is something that's important to them. So, the feedback there has been great. And we have some Sponsored Snap tests forthcoming in the quarter. So, once we have some more data back there, we'll be eager to share that as well. Yeah. Thanks, Ken. I think, as we look at the evolution with Simple Snapchat, our North Star has always been creating the best possible product experience for our community, and a product experience that they really love. I think there are some challenges today, as we've innovated over the years and created all these new ways to engage, with Snapchat, the app has become quite complex. And even basic things like watching Stories or watching Spotlight, that's something that people have to do in two different screens right now. And so, being able to unify the content experience I think is something that's going to be a really important step in the right direction for us. Same goes for content discovery, for example. I think today the tile-based content discovery is just not as effective as full-screen content discovery. And so, I think that's a big opportunity that will not only benefit folks using Snapchat, but also creators who are working really hard to reach our audience with really compelling content. So I think, in general, this North Star of our community and, of course, our partners like creators is really important to us. And then, what we found is that, that over the over the long term, tends to create more opportunity for advertising partners as well, as they're able to reach our audience through these different parts of our service. So, I think, the North Star is going to be the community engagement and then thinking about how we can best manage this transition so that our advertising partners and our content partners can benefit from it as well. We've seen really strong growth in Spotlight engagement globally. I think North America, as we shared in the letter, we've essentially been offsetting some declines with the Stories content engagement, while we've seen growth in Spotlight. So, I think you're just seeing a bit of a mix shift there. But overall, the growth of Spotlight and the depth of engagement has been a big driver of content view time growth for us. Thanks, Ross. Yeah, we're really excited about the progress we're making with Spectacles and it's been really exciting to share the fifth generation with so many of our partners and developers. I think right now we're just really focused on helping people build amazing lenses for Spectacles. I think one of the challenges that any new computing platform sort of faces is this chicken and egg problem of people really needing, in our case, new lens experiences to use when they first buy AR glasses. And so, by focusing on really seeding and supporting that developer ecosystem and making sure there are amazing lenses for people to use when they buy the consumer product, I think we're really focused on the key problem we need to solve in advance of widespread consumer adoption. So, we're going to stay focused there for now. It's been so exciting to see the amazing lenses people have already built in the weeks since launch. And we think there's just a huge opportunity to transform the way people use computing, grounded in the real world and together with their friends and leveraging natural interactions. And this is a vision we've been working towards for over a decade now. And so, we have some very unique assets to leverage like Lens Studio, which helps people build these really complex AR experiences and then run them in a really performant way on Lens Core that powers not just the Snapchat application, but also our Spectacles glasses. So, that alongside all of our investments in hardware and the progress we've made, just makes me really excited about where we are now and, of course, the potential to get this into customers' hands. So, we're going to stay focused on our strategy and keep executing. We're really excited to share, more with you soon."

With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Evan.\nEvan Spiegel: Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Q2 marked an important milestone for Snap as we reached more than 850 million monthly active users and 432 million daily active users on the path to our goal of 1 billion monthly active users. Our focus on visual communication between friends and family is a strategic advantage that has enabled us to serve more than 75% of 13 to 34-year-olds in over 25 countries. As Snapchat has grown, our community has grown with us, and approximately 80% of Snapchatters are above the age of 18. We also continue to broaden and deepen engagement with our content platform in Q2, with global content viewers growing 12% year-over-year, and global time spent watching content growing 25% year-over-year. The growth of our community, the progress we have made with our direct response advertising business, and the success of our Snapchat Plus subscription business that now reaches more than 11 million subscribers, all contributed to revenue growth of 16% year-over-year, despite the impact of a weaker brand advertising environment for certain consumer discretionary verticals. We are pleased with the ongoing progress made in our DR business as well as well as the continued rapid growth in the total number of active advertisers which more than doubled year-over-year in Q2. We believe this progress validates our strategy of focusing on growing our community and engagement, investing in our Direct Response advertising products, and diversifying our revenue growth with our subscription offering. The actions we have taken to optimize our cost structure have cleared a path to meaningful Adjusted EBITDA profitability and positive free cash flow. In Q2, the combination of topline progress and expense discipline translated to $55 million of Adjusted EBITDA and sets us up well for continued improvement in operating leverage as the year progresses. Adjusted EBITDA flow through, or the share of incremental year-over-year revenue that flowed through to Adjusted EBITDA, was 55% in Q2, up from 22% in Q1. Moving forward, we will continue to calibrate our investments carefully to ensure we build on this momentum, while also realizing the operating leverage necessary to drive improved financial performance. We believe that the strong financial foundation we are building and our track record of innovation position us well to fulfill our long-term vision for augmented reality. Visual communication is at the core of the Snapchat experience. Our strategy to drive Daily Active User growth and engagement is focused on improving the way Snapchatters communicate and interact with their friends, family, and the world. We have delivered a number of new communication features and user experience enhancements in recent months to execute on this strategic initiative. For example, in Q2, we introduced Map Reactions that enable Snapchatters to send their favorite emojis to friends on the Snap Map to start conversations. We also launched Editable Chats, which allow Snapchatters to edit messages up to five minutes after sending them, and My AI Reminders that give Snapchatters the ability to ask for a reminder for an upcoming deadline. In addition, we are investing to enhance iOS app performance by making improvements to battery management, app and screen loading latency, and camera quality. We are also leveraging machine learning and generative AI to help our community form meaningful connections and to deliver engaging product experiences. These improvements have contributed to all-time highs in the number of daily active users sending Snaps in every region, which is an important input to sustained daily engagement. The results of these initiatives are reflected in our global community reaching 432 million Daily Active Users in Q2, an increase of 10 million quarter-over-quarter. Daily Active Users in North America was 100 million, down by less than 1% year-over-year, but up quarter-over-quarter as our initiatives to improve the way Snapchatters communicate begin to show early signs of progress. DAU in Europe was 97 million, compared to 96 million in the prior quarter and 94 million in the prior year. DAU in Rest of World was 235 million, compared to 226 million in the prior quarter and 202 million in the prior year. To further deepen content engagement, we continue to invest in our ML models to improve content ranking and personalization across all of our content surfaces. As a result, we are seeing significant improvement in content engagement, with global time spent watching content growing 25% year-over-year and 10% quarter-over-quarter in Q2, driven by strong growth in total time spent watching Spotlight and Creator Stories. In North America, some of our changes have been disruptive, and this contributed to mixed results on time spent with content, which declined by just under 2% on a year-over-year basis while increasing nearly 6% on a quarter-over-quarter basis in Q2. North America content engagement trends improved as we moved through the quarter, and time spent with content increased year-over-year in the month of June. In Q2, we continued to make progress unifying the ranking models between Spotlight and Stories to a single backend stack that ranks all content types to deliver the most engaging content to our community, regardless of format. To expand our content supply, we are focused on growing our creator community and making it easier for creators to submit and subsequently share compelling content. These efforts contributed in part to the number of creators submitting Spotlight content growing more than 20% year-over-year in Q2. We are also working with publisher partners to bring new and engaging content to our community. For example, in Q2, we announced Snap Nation, an evolution in our existing partnership with Live Nation that gives Snapchatters access to tour and festival experiences, including exclusive behind-the-scenes content and live music experiences. Augmented reality continues to inspire communication, and Snapchatters play with AR Lenses billions of times per day on average. In Q2, the number of Snapchatters sharing AR Lens experiences with their friends increased 12% year-over-year, driven by the popularity of innovative generative AI Lenses and improved ranking and optimization of our AR experiences. For example, our ML Scribble World Lens, which enables Snapchatters to transform into artistic, cartoon-style versions of themselves, was viewed over 1 billion times in Q2, and our 90s AI Lens was viewed by more than 20% of U.S. Snapchatters. In addition, we launched a generative AI Lens in collaboration with Beyonc\u00e9, dedicated to her new COWBOY CARTER album, which was engaged with 80 million times in the first three days. We continue to improve our AR ranking technology in order to personalize the AR experience and deliver relevant AR content to our community. We recently enabled dynamic, ML-driven Lens ranking based on Snapchatter preferences, and we improved the quality of Lens ranking model predictions for AR Snaps. These initiatives contributed to a 10% year-over-year increase in Snap Story posts with an AR Lens globally. Our progress in AR is powered by our Lens Studio developer platform and the hundreds of thousands of creators who have leveraged this platform. In Q2, we released Lens Studio 5.0, which features our new GenAI Suite, powered by proprietary SnapML technology, that enables Lens creators to generate Lenses in minutes using a text prompt that requires no coding by the creator. The response to our new tools in Lens Studio has been inspiring and reinforces our belief that long-term success in AR requires a vibrant developer and creator ecosystem. As we move forward, we are focused on innovating and enhancing our core product experiences in order to grow our global community and deepen engagement. We believe continued progress on these initiatives is a critical input to both serving our community and expanding our monetization opportunity over time. We look forward to sharing more of our progress at our Snap Partner Summit on September 17. We continued to make progress on three foundational advertising platform initiatives, including larger ML models, improved signals, and more performant ad formats. Our 7-0 optimization for purchases continues to drive encouraging results for advertising partners. For example, Ridge, an everyday essentials e-commerce company, continued to lean into Snap\u2019s DR best practices to drive success. Leveraging 7-0 Optimization, Conversions API, and our ML-based Auto-Bidding, Ridge drove a 73% higher ROAS compared to their prior campaign strategy. For app-based advertisers, we have invested in improvements across the entire ad stack. We made ad format enhancements and streamlined the app download experience on iOS, so that Snapchatters can install apps without leaving Snapchat. Early testing shows that the enhanced app download experience is driving lower cost per install and improved ROAS for advertisers. We also expanded 7-0 Optimization to app install and app purchase and, after testing showed consistent improvement in cost-per-install and cost-per-purchase, we recently began scaling these products with our advertising partners. We are encouraged to see that a number of gaming app clients, including Roblox, are seeing a 30\u201350% improvement in ROAS on Snapchat. We have also begun testing Value Optimization, which allows advertisers to bid on the value of purchases, and we are seeing encouraging early results. We anticipate that mobile gaming and e-commerce advertisers in particular will benefit from these new optimizations. For example, Lanc\u00f4me, a beauty brand from L\u2019Or\u00e9al, leveraged our new Value Optimization with the aim of increasing average purchase cart size and ROAS. The campaign exceeded expectations and delivered a 38% increase in average purchase cart size and a 4.4x increase in ROAS Our DR ad platform relies on scaled privacy-centric signals that advertisers can use to optimize their ad campaigns. Conversions API, our privacy-centric first-party signal solution, is driving improved results for advertisers. For example, European e-commerce company My Jewellery saw their campaign deliver 156% higher last click ROAS and 13% lower cost-per-visit after implementing CAPI. In addition, we announced several partnerships, including Snowflake, Datahash, LiveRamp, and Tealium, to make it easier for advertisers to adopt Conversions API in a seamless and privacy-centric way. Our improvements to Conversions API, improved collaboration with advertisers, and growth in partner integrations resulted in Conversions API integrations growing over 300% year-over-year in Q2. We are excited by the progress we\u2019re seeing with our small and medium-size business advertising partners. Today, SMBs and creators alike can promote their services, content, or products, reach new audiences, and gain more followers, all in just a few taps within Snapchat. In addition, we launched useful tools such as dynamic campaign setup recommendations and codeless Pixel setups to help businesses achieve higher ROAS. These changes have been instrumental in the growth of SMB advertisers on Snapchat, which contributed in part to total active advertisers more than doubling year-over-year in Q2. This quarter, we continued to build compelling advertising products to help our brand advertising partners reach the Snapchat community at scale. For example, at our NewFronts presentation, we announced a number of sponsorship opportunities, including our partnership with NBCUniversal for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, where some of our most popular creators will share stories of the games with their unique perspectives and on-the-ground access in Paris. We also renewed our longstanding sports partnerships with the NFL, NBA, and WNBA, to provide official content across Stories and Spotlight for our community. In an effort to drive incremental performance for brands, we recently announced the Snap Advanced Partner Program, which will offer qualifying agencies and advertisers personalized training and enablement sessions, dedicated support, and additional tools and resources to enhance their campaigns. Our sponsored AR advertising solutions offer marketers the opportunity to leverage unique and engaging augmented reality experiences that lift the measurable performance of their brand campaigns. Specifically, research has shown that campaigns that pair AR Ads with Video Ads on Snapchat deliver 1.6x ad awareness lift when compared to Video Ads alone. Research from our partnership with OMD and Amplified Intelligence found that Snapchat campaigns that include AR in their mix drive 5x more active attention compared to industry peers. In order to expand the reach and impact of our AR advertising solutions, we recently launched AR Extensions for businesses, which extend our AR advertising products beyond the camera to all of our ad surfaces, including our Dynamic Product Ads, Snap Ads, Collection Ads, Commercials, and Spotlight. As we move forward, we have conviction that our continued focus on improving our ad platform and delivering solutions that drive measurable business results for our advertising partners is the key to building a larger and more durable advertising business. With the most important foundational elements of our advertising platform now in place, we look forward to making further progress on helping our advertising partners grow their businesses. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Derek to discuss our financial results.\nDerek Andersen: Thanks Evan and good afternoon everyone. Total revenue was $1.24 billion in Q2, up 16% year-over-year, while advertising revenue was $1.13 billion, up 10% year-over-year. DR advertising revenue increased 16% year-over-year driven by a combination of total active advertisers more than doubling year-over-year, continued progress with our 7-0 Pixel Purchase Optimization, and early contributions from the product improvements delivered for app-based advertisers. Brand-oriented advertising revenue declined 1% year-over-year, driven by particularly weak demand from certain consumer discretionary verticals including retail, technology, and entertainment, as well as the timing impact of holidays shifting out of Q2 in the current year. We continued to make progress toward diversifying our revenue sources, with Other Revenue up 151% year-over-year to reach $105 million in Q2. Other Revenue includes all non-advertising revenue, the majority of which is Snapchat+ subscription revenue and Snapchat+ reached the 11 million subscriber milestone in Q2. In Q2, North America revenue grew 12% year-over-year, with the relatively lower rate of growth in this region due to the impact of weaker brand-oriented demand being relatively concentrated in North America. DR was a bright spot in North America in Q2, driven in part by strong growth from our small and medium-size customer segment. In an effort to accelerate our growth in the Americas, we made changes in Q2 to optimize our go-to-market organization in North America to better support clients where we see the best product market fit and greatest opportunity for our business going forward. Europe revenue grew 26% year-over-year, as continued progress on our DR ad platform, and a relatively more stable demand environment for Brand oriented advertising solutions, fully offset the impact of more challenging prior year comparisons. Rest of World revenue grew at 20% year-over-year, driven by the continued progress of our DR ad platform, while the deceleration versus the prior quarter growth rate was due primarily to the timing of holiday periods shifting out of Q2 this year. Global impression volume grew approximately 13% year-over-year, driven in large part by expanded advertising delivery within Spotlight. Total eCPMs were down approximately 3% year-over-year as inventory growth exceeded advertising demand growth in Q2. Adjusted cost of revenue was $586 million in Q2, up 19% year-over-year. Infrastructure costs were the largest driver of the year-over-year increase in adjusted cost of revenue, driven in large part by the ramp in ML and AI investments that we implemented in Q2 and Q3 of the prior year. Infrastructure cost per DAU was $0.81 in Q2, which is up from $0.80 in the prior quarter, but below our expected range of $0.83 to $0.85 per DAU due to a combination of greater than expected engineering efficiencies and a more moderate ramp in ML and AI investments. The remaining components of adjusted cost of revenue were $236 million in Q2, or 19% of revenue, which is in line with the prior quarter and at the lower end of our full-year cost structure guidance range. Adjusted gross margin was relatively stable at 53% in Q2, up from 52% in the prior quarter but down slightly from 54% in the prior year. Adjusted operating expenses were $596 million in Q2, down 3% year-over-year. Personnel costs decreased 12% year-over-year in Q2 following the restructuring initiative we announced in Q1. We ended Q2 with 4,719 full-time headcount, down 11% year-over-year. The decline in personnel-related costs was partially offset by increases in legal related costs in Q2, including the impact of complying with an increasingly complex global regulatory environment, as well as the impact of a previously announced settlement with the state of California. In addition, we incurred $8 million in costs related to the retroactive Digital Services Tax implemented by the Canadian government in Q2. Adjusted EBITDA was $55 million in Q2, up from negative $38 million in Q2 of the prior year, reflecting higher revenue and operating expense discipline. Adjusted EBITDA flow through or the share of incremental year-over-year revenue that flowed through to Adjusted EBITDA was 55% in Q2, up from 22% in Q1, as we continue to carefully prioritize our investments in order to drive topline growth and deliver improved profitability. Net loss was $249 million in Q2, compared to a net loss of $377 million in Q2 of the prior year. The improvement in net loss year-over-year reflects the flow-through of the $93 million improvement in Adjusted EBITDA as well as a $57 million reduction in stock based compensation and related expenses. The reduction in stock based compensation was driven by a combination of the diminished impact of refresh grants on the GAAP accounting of SBC, combined with the reduction in headcount that resulted from our recent restructuring. The $269 million of SBC and related expenses we reported in Q2 better reflects our SBC related expenses at current staffing levels. The benefits of improved Adjusted EBITDA and lower SBC were partially offset by $16 million in costs associated with the early retirement of $386 million of our outstanding convertible notes in Q2. Free cash flow was negative $73 million in Q2, which reflects the impact of collecting seasonally lower Q1 revenue in Q2. Over the trailing twelve months, free cash flow was positive $15 million while operating cash flow was positive $244 million as we continue to balance investments with topline growth to deliver sustained positive cash flow. Dilution, or year-over-year growth in our share count, was 1.9% in Q2, down from 3.8% in the prior quarter. As part of our efforts to responsibly manage the impact of SBC on our share count, we repurchased 7 million shares at a cost of $76 million in Q2, reflecting an average share repurchase price of $11.06. Since we began opportunistically managing our share count through share repurchases in Q3 of 2022, we have repurchased 151.5 million shares, representing 8.4% of fully diluted shares outstanding, at an average price of $9.91 per share and a total cost of $1.5 billion. In Q2, we issued $750 million in convertible notes maturing in 2030 with a coupon of 50 basis points. In addition, we negotiated the repurchase of $148 million of our 2025 convertible notes and $238 million of our 2026 convertible notes. We also unwound the capped calls associated with our 2025 convertible notes, resulting in proceeds of $63 million. We ended Q2 with $3.1 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand, with no debt maturing in the current year, $36 million maturing in 2025, and $250 million maturing in 2026. We believe the combination of these transactions have ensured more than adequate liquidity for our operations while further strengthening our balance sheet for the long-term. As we enter Q3, we anticipate continued growth of our global community, and as a result, our Q3 guidance is built on the assumption that DAU will be approximately 441 million in Q3. We are focused on executing against our roadmap to deliver improvements to our advertising platform to drive strong performance for our advertising partners. Our Q3 guidance range for revenue is $1.335 billion to $1.375 billion, implying year-over-year revenue growth of 12% to 16%. Our investment plans for Q3 remain consistent with the full-year cost guidance ranges we provided last quarter, which assume we make modest incremental investments in infrastructure, personnel, and marketing to sustain the momentum we have established in our business, and that we continue to experience the impact of an increasing legal and regulatory burden on our cost structure. Given the revenue range above, and our investment plans for Q3, we estimate that Adjusted EBITDA will be between $70 million and $100 million in Q3. As we move forward into the second half of 2024, we will remain focused on prioritizing our investments carefully to deliver against the cost plans we have set out for our business, while investing prudently to deliver for our community and our partners. To learn more about the progress we are making for our community and our partners we encourage you to tune into our 6th annual Snap Partner Summit on Tuesday, September 17. Thank you. And we\u2019ll now take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nKenneth Gawrelski: Thank you very much. Good afternoon. To help us out with maybe some of the volatility you've seen in advertising results over the last several quarters. Could you just talk a little bit about the advertising performance within the quarter, maybe how the months progressed in the June quarter? And then maybe I'll -- the third quarter has started off. And maybe just to add to that, could you talk a little bit about the impacts of the Olympics? I know you've put out releases about your NBC relationship with the Olympics and some of the content related to that. Could you talk about contributions from the Olympics in 3Q and then potentially political in the U.S. in the second half? Thank you.\nDerek Andersen: Ken, it's Derek speaking. Thanks for the question. I think at a high level, it might make sense to talk about how revenue growth has progressed through the course of Q2 in the context of brand and DR separately. I think one of the things that we're seeing with the DR business is that it is incredibly resilient, and it's been growing at a pretty strong clip. And it's also fairly stable. So to put a little bit finer point on that, direct response revenue advertising was up 16% year-over-year in Q2. And that's roughly in line with the 17% that we observed in Q1 despite a tougher comp going into Q2. So what you're seeing is a business there that is very much based on performance. And so if you're looking under the hood of that business, we're seeing really good momentum on our 70 pixel purchase optimizations. And then as we move into the current quarter, that's performing alongside some of the newer advertising solutions we've delivered for app-based advertisers. I think Evan mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks that we've been scaling up our 70 optimization to App Install and app purchases in the quarter after some of the testing that showed really good results. And we're seeing advertisers benefit from that now. And then we've shared some case studies also in the letter to that effect. We also began testing value optimization in Q2, and we see some really good results from that in the early going, which is promising. And then you've also got the ongoing momentum of really strong CAP adoption. That was up 300% year-over-year which is, of course, an improved -- a driver of improved performance. So taken together, that's contributing to a business on the DR side that's highly performing and has some ongoing growth behind it. And you can see that also reflected in the really strong growth we're seeing in active advertisers there. We shared earlier that we saw active advertisers more than double year-over-year in Q2. And obviously, that's reflective of some really strong growth we're seeing in the SMC segment. And of course, there's a number of drivers behind that, including the progress we're making with Snap Promote some of the things we're seeing around automated campaign setup tools to make it easier to get started and realize positive ROA quickly for those customers. And then also some improvements in our go-to-market operations there on the SMC side in order to help us focus on acquiring and supporting clients where we have a really good product market fit. So that business, there's a reason why we've been very focused on investing in this business because it's performance-based tends to be more resilient, and the growth there is a little bit more stable. I think over time, what you're seeing in the -- on the brand side is there are a couple of things that led to the decel there from the prior quarter. We mentioned one of them on the last call, which is just that there's some timing of some events and holidays in Q2 that were a bit of a headwind, but that was known going into the quarter. I think the portion of the demand performance in Q2 that was particularly disappointing in some of the weakness that we've seen in particular consumer discretionary verticals, including technology, entertainment and retail that we mentioned earlier. And so when I'm thinking about that business, we've built a very large brand-oriented business over the years. And we have very performing brand products for our advertisers to allow us to reach our very large community at scale when they have big events and whatnot. But we've also learned over time that, that brand business can be very volatile, which is again why we focused a lot on investing in the DR business. So I think a really good example what we can see in moments of volatility like this or where we're seeing in moments where maybe the economic environment is tougher and people start moving down funnel with their marketing investments is that we do particularly well in verticals where we have really good performance for Direct Response. And so I think a good example of a vertical that fits that is restaurants. In the most recent quarter, I think you've probably seen lots of economic data suggesting that the environment for restaurants has been a little tougher in some cases, but that's a category that continues to grow for us on the DR side in the current quarter because we've got great performance for those advertisers, and they've been able to continue to invest and grow their business on the back of that. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit clearer understanding of the dichotomy there. And then as we move into Q3, maybe I'll share a little bit of color on how we thought about our revenue guide for Q3. To start off with, we shared the expectation for top line growth in Q3 would be 12% to 16% year-over-year. First of all, just to put that in context, that implies quarter-over-quarter growth of 8% to 11%, which historically speaking, would be a really strong quarter-over-quarter result for Q3. And we are off to a good start to begin the new quarter, which is reflected in that. And I think if you step back and look on a 2-year stack basis, can give a little bit more context too, that implies 18% to 22% on a 2-year stack which would be a significant step up from the 11% to 12% that we've seen in the first half of this year. So hopefully, that puts the guide into Q3 into a little bit more context. Specifically, we expect more of this trend of the business and its growth going forward to continue to be driven by strong performance from the DR business. We've got a great road map there and of course, continued contributions from Snapchat+ which other revenue, which comprised mostly of subscription revenue up 150% plus year-over-year and now at a run rate of over $100 million a quarter. So those are the big areas we're seeing -- expecting to see drivers from the brand side, we've not assumed that we would see a big rebound in Q3. Now certainly, you called out some events like the Olympics, and we've got a great lineup of content around the Olympics. We've got creators at the Olympics covering things we've had lots of participation in athletes. The content on the platform has been terrific. And of course, we do see brand spending around halo events like that. But at a high level across the entirety of the quarter, we've not built a huge recovery in that brand business in there. We're expecting the step up in improvements in the business in Q3 to come predominantly from the DR and Snapchats+ business in the coming quarters. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit better sense of how the business has been progressing year-to-date and what we expect things to look like as we go into the next quarter. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Salmon with New Street Research. Your line is now open.\nDaniel Salmon: Hi, good afternoon everyone. I have a 2-part question. So the total advertiser count more than doubled this quarter. That's a little different than the 85% growth in SMB advertisers you talked about last quarter, but presumably, SMBs are still a big driver of that. So the first part is, can you speak to the drivers of advertiser growth count? I imagine improvements in the DR ad performance are part of that, but are there any of the partner programs, reseller agreements or anything else that you'd highlight that are really helping drive that growth. And then the second part is on your ad product road map and whether or not this growth in the total advertiser count has you rethinking any elements of the road map. And in particular, whether it starts to make sense to look at developing more AI-based automated ad buying products like those we're seeing generate a lot of value for SMBs on other platforms. I'd just be curious to hear your updated thoughts on whether that makes sense yet. Thanks.\nEvan Spiegel: Thanks, Dan. I think just at a high level, we're incredibly excited by what we're seeing with small and medium-sized advertisers. I think our SMC business overall is probably the most important driver of long-term revenue growth for us over the coming years. So to really see that progress there has been really exciting. From a road map and automation perspective, automation is vitally important for these advertisers and it can really reduce the friction in terms of getting started and then ultimately growing spend on Snap. I think if you look at some of the enhancements we've made for SMC advertisers, we're getting better at inferring SMC advertiser objectives when they sign up for an account on Snapchat and then we direct those customers to preconfigured campaign setups. And that can be really helpful for getting folks started. We also offer tools like codeless signal set up, for example, that are very useful. I do think there's more we can do on automation, especially in terms of creative optimization as well as budget optimization. We have some improvements coming there. I think -- more specifically, we're thinking ahead to the holiday season. So as I look at e-commerce, SMC advertisers, we're really focused on things like product selection, leveraging on and off platform, privacy-safe signals, doing more work to drive in session conversions with some major model updates we've been working on. And then overall streamlining the checkout experience, which we think is really important for driving more of those in-section conversions. Those in-section conversions are some of the most incremental conversions. They're really valuable to SMC advertisers. I think in terms of the top of funnel for the SMC business, 1 of the big drivers there has been Snap Promote, which allows advertisers to get started in app. We reached over 850 million users on a monthly basis. And so I think we've just been really excited to see that their passion for our service and their usage of our service has also, I think, encouraged them to try out Snapchat for growing their business with our advertising tools. So I do think the Snapchat community overall will be a great source of growth for our SMC business, and we're very focused on growing that both in the near term, but more importantly, as a real long-term driver of our growth.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes, hi, this is Katy [ph] on for Doug. First, I just want to touch on the brand business. Again, I know you mentioned it's been more volatile versus DR is more resilient. So can you just talk about how much visibility you typically have over the brand side and what you can do to maybe improve the stickiness of spending on Snap within brand overall? And then second, on the engagement side of the platform, that's obviously been an important focus area. You talked about rolling out some product improvement inter-quarter. Some had positive effects on engagement in North America, some more negative. So can you just talk about the puts and takes there and just to give a little bit more color. Thanks.\nEvan Spiegel: Yes. Thanks, Katy. I think as we look at the brand business, the most important thing is really driving performance for advertisers. And -- our solutions are very performant, whether advertisers are measuring performance with our first-party tools or with MM or MTA, results and I think more recently with some of our conversion lift solutions. So we continue to help advertisers really measure what matters most to them. And I think one of the most important things, especially as we look at brand spend in the back half is the relationship between brand spend and lower funnel performance. And I think some of the most sophisticated advertisers are really leveraging full funnel solutions because building that brand awareness is really important in terms of improving overall conversion rates on the lower funnel. So I think as we get into the back half of the year, really working with our advertising partners to make sure they're leveraging our full funnel offering and our performance brand solutions will be really important. And then I think in terms of the progress we're making on content engagement, especially in North America, the team has had a bit of a split focus over the past couple of quarters, we've been building out a whole new back-end ranking stack that combines stories and Spotlight. We think that's a better experience for our community because it combines both types of content that they really love. Spotlight has been a real bright spot for us in terms of growth and engagement and so have creator stories. And then, of course, as always, a friend stories. People love to see what their friends are up to. So being able to combine all those content types rather than requiring our community to go to different places to get those different types of content, I think we'll be very positive for the content experience on Snapchat. But maintaining our existing production content stack while building a whole new combined stack has been a bit of a challenge and what the team's focus. And I think that contributed to a little bit of the choppiness we saw through the quarter. But ultimately, as we look at North America engagement overall, both North America, DAU and content time spend were both up quarter-over-quarter. So directionally positive as we really work to make progress there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rich Greenfield with Lightshed Partners. Your line is now open.\nRichard Greenfield: Hi. I got a couple of questions. One, I just wanted to follow up on DR. You talked about DR advertisers and API integrations making meaningful progress over the course of the quarter and obviously, year-over-year, yet, Derek, I think you talked to a slowdown in the ad revenue tied to DR from Q1 to Q2. I guess the question everyone who's listening to this call was wondering is like given all the progress you've made and how much focus you put. Why is DR not exploding? Like why is it growing mid-teens? Why isn't it scaling dramatically? And tied to that is just how much of a headwind is brand advertising in the Q3 guide? And then just a follow-up for Evan. On the whole conversation you were having on the last question about the integration of the app what is actually causing -- when you talk about sort of the changes are pressuring time spent, what's actually happening? And what you're learning as you make this integration is the goal still to get to a single unified like you open up the app and its content. Is that still the plan? And how soon could we see that from what you've been testing overseas? When could we see that in the U.S.?\nDerek Andersen: Hey Richard, thanks for the question. I think just diving in a little bit on the Q3 guide and how to think about the projections for ad revenue and DR revenue specifically, I think it's important to just remember that there was a 9-point percentage point acceleration in overall revenue in the prior year from Q2 to Q3. And it was actually a slightly faster than that acceleration for the Direct Response business. So I think to put it in a little bit more finer context, at sort of the midpoint of our guidance range for the coming quarter, we'd be overcoming almost all of that 9-point acceleration in the prior year. So we'd essentially be nearly keeping pace. And at the high end of our range, we'd be fully keeping pace with that acceleration for the prior year. And just to put a finer point on that, I want to sort of reiterate that guide implies an 8% to 11% quarter-over-quarter improvement in the overall business, which I think if you look historically across periods, is a very good result for Q3. And then to maybe even look at it another way is to think about it on a 2-year stack where the guide for Q3 implies 18% to 22% for Q3, and that's up from 12% in Q1 and 11% for Q2 of this year. So I think it's really tough to characterize that guide in Q3 is representing a business that's not improving. And you've got a pretty solid road map on the DR side. But I'll turn it over to Evan to talk a little bit more about the other parts of your question.\nEvan Spiegel: Thanks, Rich, for the question. And we've definitely been working hard on the content experience. We know how important content is to our community and also in terms of just the way that they maintain their relationships by sharing content with one another. When we look at the content experience, as I mentioned, we really want to combine stories and spotlight, which are both beloved content types on Snapchat but are now located in two different tabs on the app. And that just makes content discovery just have a bit more friction. It also doesn't take advantage of the overall supply that we have across both stories and spotlight. And we know that combining that supply will help us provide more relevant content to folks based on their interest and will allow us to leverage signals across both of those content types. So if you think about the steps to get there, 1 is sort of a user interface change that combines both the stories and short video user interface, so that has been in testing. There's also the infrastructure piece of it to combine both content types and rank across both content types, which is nontrivial because the objective function has to work across the way that those different types of content are consumed. That's also in testing, where you'll see that first is actually in spotlight, where we've made progress, for example, adding publisher stories and have been testing that combined the content experience. And of course, we'll have a bunch more to share at the upcoming Snap Partner Summit, which is on September 17. Hope to see you there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Dan [ph] Peterson on for Mark. Focusing on the brand advertiser demand, how have the verticals that you called out that were soft in Q2 trended quarter-to-date? Have they gotten worse, the same, better, and any granularity you can give on a vertical level would be helpful. Thanks.\nDerek Andersen: Hey there, thanks for the question. I think probably the most important thing to sort of zoom in on when we're talking about how we're beginning into the new quarter and what's assumed in the guide is probably a little bit of what I touched on earlier on the assumption essentially in the -- the revenue guide that the growth that we're going to see in Q3, will continue to be driven predominantly by the direct response business and the ongoing momentum we've got there as well as the continued momentum of the Snapchat+ business. So there's not an assumption built into that guide that we're going to see significantly improved or really significant turnaround in the brand performance in the quarter. Obviously, we're working hard on that. We've been delivering some innovations for customers there with some stuff we announced at new fronts and other things we've talked about in a letter there. So I would sort of think of it that way. What we're really focused on here, and I think you've heard us talk about this and deliver on it consistently over the last 18 months is the investments we're putting into product and go-to-market around DR and a really keen focus around delivering ad products and optimizations that deliver performance results for advertisers that they can scale on and having go-to-market operations that are wrapped around those solutions and deliver to customers, we have strong product market fit from. I think you're going to see us continue to lean into the momentum we're seeing in the small and medium-sized customer front and some of the optimized campaign setups that we're delivering there continuing to lean into Snap Promote, continuing to deliver performance results for those folks as well. So building on what have been our strategic priorities for the last 18 to 24 months and building on the results that we saw in the most recent quarter around our DR and Snapchat+ verticals. So hopefully that helps a little.\nOperator: Our next question comes from [Indiscernible] with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Could you provide some insights into the current stage of spotlight monetization and how you are expected to grow over the next few quarters? And in the long run, how big can the surface become related to your current scale and potential time frame for that. Thank you.\nEvan Spiegel: Thanks so much for the question. We've definitely been excited about the growth in spotlight time spend, the uptake of that service. And certainly, it's been a source of inventory growth for us. I think if I compare time spent on spotlight to other short video services, I think we have an enormous amount of headroom on Snapchat. That's part of the reason why we focus so much on this combined content experience, we know how much our community loves stories, and we really believe that a combined experience that combines the stories format with short-form video will be most compelling and easiest to use, especially in terms of content discovery. So the team has been working very hard on that. We continue to make progress in terms of model improvements. We've seen some great growth in terms of spotlight submissions and that's helping with overall content supply. One big area of focus for us in the coming months is really around model freshness and making sure that we are updating our models quickly enough to learn from engagement with new pieces of content so that we can serve the freshest possible original content to our community and not have to wait for days in some cases, for us to understand and leverage that signal. So a lot to do there, but certainly, I'm pleased with the growth so far and excited to get the combined content experience out to our community.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Shmulik with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Jenny [ph] on behalf of Mark Shmulik. Thank you for taking our questions. We just have one, just given the launch of Snapchat's web product, is there any consideration to moving away from having the app open to the camera to perhaps something more like spotlight, that's more monetizable. Thank you.\nEvan Spiegel: Thank you so much for the question. Opening to the camera has always been a really important part of the Snapchat experience, especially because it keeps you grounded in the real world with your friends rather than distracting you with content created by other people. And that prompt to create and express yourself is something that's really important to the Snapchat product. It starts -- helps people start new conversations when they share a Snap or helps them share what they're seeing and experiencing with their friends if they add that snap to their story. And of course, it's an amazing top of funnel for our augmented reality platform where hundreds of millions of Snapchatters engage with lenses on a regular basis. So I think opening to the camera is really a unique part of the Snapchat experience and part of what really differentiates our service. And I think given the strength we've seen now, I think it's been almost, what, 13 years that we've been working on Snapchat, we continue to see new highs in terms of the number of unique Snap centers, which were up across hit record highs across all regions in the quarter. So I think the strength of the core product and that prompt to really express yourself and share with your close friends and family is something that's really unique to Snap and differentiates our service. I do think, though, and I don't want to run too much of the surprise with the Snap Partner Summit coming up. But there is an opportunity, I believe, to help simplify the Snapchat experience overall, and that's something we have been working towards, and we look forward to sharing more at the Summit.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much. Maybe taking a step back and asking a bigger picture question, Evan. You talked a lot and you have a lot of detail on this call so far in terms of the journey you've been on sort of the evolution of the platform and product as you sort of look towards the back half of this year and was a value towards 2025, any updated skew in terms of your key investment priorities or things you think of is critical to execute on that positions the platform for elements of user growth, engagement or monetization with an eye to the medium to long term. Thanks very much.\nEvan Spiegel: Thanks so much for the question. I've certainly been spending a lot more of my time over the past year or so on the monetization side of the business. And I think just looking at the long-term strength of the business and our opportunity in augmented reality. I think a personal goal and maybe a broader growth for the business is really to have our revenue resilience match the engagement resilience we see on our platform with our community of 850 million people around the world. I think over the years, we've seen that, that engagement has really been durable, and we've been able to continue to grow service. I think as I look at the revenue side of things, what really excites me and a big area of focus and investment for us in the coming year will be the small and medium-sized customer segment. I think it really leverages the strength of our scale with our community and also our ability on the product and engineering side to drive results for advertisers. And ultimately, we really believe that, that will result in much more resilient revenue from a diversified customer base, and that's a sort of foundation we want to be building our business on for the long-term. So certainly a continued focus on the monetization side, especially with small, medium-sized customers and then making a lot of progress on foundationally on our machine learning models and our ability to drive performance.\nOperator: Thank you.

            "name": "Derek Andersen",
            "content": "Thanks Evan and good afternoon everyone. Total revenue was $1.24 billion in Q2, up 16% year-over-year, while advertising revenue was $1.13 billion, up 10% year-over-year. DR advertising revenue increased 16% year-over-year driven by a combination of total active advertisers more than doubling year-over-year, continued progress with our 7-0 Pixel Purchase Optimization, and early contributions from the product improvements delivered for app-based advertisers. Brand-oriented advertising revenue declined 1% year-over-year, driven by particularly weak demand from certain consumer discretionary verticals including retail, technology, and entertainment, as well as the timing impact of holidays shifting out of Q2 in the current year. We continued to make progress toward diversifying our revenue sources, with Other Revenue up 151% year-over-year to reach $105 million in Q2. Other Revenue includes all non-advertising revenue, the majority of which is Snapchat+ subscription revenue and Snapchat+ reached the 11 million subscriber milestone in Q2. In Q2, North America revenue grew 12% year-over-year, with the relatively lower rate of growth in this region due to the impact of weaker brand-oriented demand being relatively concentrated in North America. DR was a bright spot in North America in Q2, driven in part by strong growth from our small and medium-size customer segment. In an effort to accelerate our growth in the Americas, we made changes in Q2 to optimize our go-to-market organization in North America to better support clients where we see the best product market fit and greatest opportunity for our business going forward. Europe revenue grew 26% year-over-year, as continued progress on our DR ad platform, and a relatively more stable demand environment for Brand oriented advertising solutions, fully offset the impact of more challenging prior year comparisons. Rest of World revenue grew at 20% year-over-year, driven by the continued progress of our DR ad platform, while the deceleration versus the prior quarter growth rate was due primarily to the timing of holiday periods shifting out of Q2 this year. Global impression volume grew approximately 13% year-over-year, driven in large part by expanded advertising delivery within Spotlight. Total eCPMs were down approximately 3% year-over-year as inventory growth exceeded advertising demand growth in Q2. Adjusted cost of revenue was $586 million in Q2, up 19% year-over-year. Infrastructure costs were the largest driver of the year-over-year increase in adjusted cost of revenue, driven in large part by the ramp in ML and AI investments that we implemented in Q2 and Q3 of the prior year. Infrastructure cost per DAU was $0.81 in Q2, which is up from $0.80 in the prior quarter, but below our expected range of $0.83 to $0.85 per DAU due to a combination of greater than expected engineering efficiencies and a more moderate ramp in ML and AI investments. The remaining components of adjusted cost of revenue were $236 million in Q2, or 19% of revenue, which is in line with the prior quarter and at the lower end of our full-year cost structure guidance range. Adjusted gross margin was relatively stable at 53% in Q2, up from 52% in the prior quarter but down slightly from 54% in the prior year. Adjusted operating expenses were $596 million in Q2, down 3% year-over-year. Personnel costs decreased 12% year-over-year in Q2 following the restructuring initiative we announced in Q1. We ended Q2 with 4,719 full-time headcount, down 11% year-over-year. The decline in personnel-related costs was partially offset by increases in legal related costs in Q2, including the impact of complying with an increasingly complex global regulatory environment, as well as the impact of a previously announced settlement with the state of California. In addition, we incurred $8 million in costs related to the retroactive Digital Services Tax implemented by the Canadian government in Q2. Adjusted EBITDA was $55 million in Q2, up from negative $38 million in Q2 of the prior year, reflecting higher revenue and operating expense discipline. Adjusted EBITDA flow through or the share of incremental year-over-year revenue that flowed through to Adjusted EBITDA was 55% in Q2, up from 22% in Q1, as we continue to carefully prioritize our investments in order to drive topline growth and deliver improved profitability. Net loss was $249 million in Q2, compared to a net loss of $377 million in Q2 of the prior year. The improvement in net loss year-over-year reflects the flow-through of the $93 million improvement in Adjusted EBITDA as well as a $57 million reduction in stock based compensation and related expenses. The reduction in stock based compensation was driven by a combination of the diminished impact of refresh grants on the GAAP accounting of SBC, combined with the reduction in headcount that resulted from our recent restructuring. The $269 million of SBC and related expenses we reported in Q2 better reflects our SBC related expenses at current staffing levels. The benefits of improved Adjusted EBITDA and lower SBC were partially offset by $16 million in costs associated with the early retirement of $386 million of our outstanding convertible notes in Q2. Free cash flow was negative $73 million in Q2, which reflects the impact of collecting seasonally lower Q1 revenue in Q2. Over the trailing twelve months, free cash flow was positive $15 million while operating cash flow was positive $244 million as we continue to balance investments with topline growth to deliver sustained positive cash flow. Dilution, or year-over-year growth in our share count, was 1.9% in Q2, down from 3.8% in the prior quarter. As part of our efforts to responsibly manage the impact of SBC on our share count, we repurchased 7 million shares at a cost of $76 million in Q2, reflecting an average share repurchase price of $11.06. Since we began opportunistically managing our share count through share repurchases in Q3 of 2022, we have repurchased 151.5 million shares, representing 8.4% of fully diluted shares outstanding, at an average price of $9.91 per share and a total cost of $1.5 billion. In Q2, we issued $750 million in convertible notes maturing in 2030 with a coupon of 50 basis points. In addition, we negotiated the repurchase of $148 million of our 2025 convertible notes and $238 million of our 2026 convertible notes. We also unwound the capped calls associated with our 2025 convertible notes, resulting in proceeds of $63 million. We ended Q2 with $3.1 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand, with no debt maturing in the current year, $36 million maturing in 2025, and $250 million maturing in 2026. We believe the combination of these transactions have ensured more than adequate liquidity for our operations while further strengthening our balance sheet for the long-term. As we enter Q3, we anticipate continued growth of our global community, and as a result, our Q3 guidance is built on the assumption that DAU will be approximately 441 million in Q3. We are focused on executing against our roadmap to deliver improvements to our advertising platform to drive strong performance for our advertising partners. Our Q3 guidance range for revenue is $1.335 billion to $1.375 billion, implying year-over-year revenue growth of 12% to 16%. Our investment plans for Q3 remain consistent with the full-year cost guidance ranges we provided last quarter, which assume we make modest incremental investments in infrastructure, personnel, and marketing to sustain the momentum we have established in our business, and that we continue to experience the impact of an increasing legal and regulatory burden on our cost structure. Given the revenue range above, and our investment plans for Q3, we estimate that Adjusted EBITDA will be between $70 million and $100 million in Q3. As we move forward into the second half of 2024, we will remain focused on prioritizing our investments carefully to deliver against the cost plans we have set out for our business, while investing prudently to deliver for our community and our partners. To learn more about the progress we are making for our community and our partners we encourage you to tune into our 6th annual Snap Partner Summit on Tuesday, September 17. Thank you. And we'll now take your questions. Ken, it's Derek speaking. Thanks for the question. I think at a high level, it might make sense to talk about how revenue growth has progressed through the course of Q2 in the context of brand and DR separately. I think one of the things that we're seeing with the DR business is that it is incredibly resilient, and it's been growing at a pretty strong clip. And it's also fairly stable. So to put a little bit finer point on that, direct response revenue advertising was up 16% year-over-year in Q2. And that's roughly in line with the 17% that we observed in Q1 despite a tougher comp going into Q2. So what you're seeing is a business there that is very much based on performance. And so if you're looking under the hood of that business, we're seeing really good momentum on our 70 pixel purchase optimizations. And then as we move into the current quarter, that's performing alongside some of the newer advertising solutions we've delivered for app-based advertisers. I think Evan mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks that we've been scaling up our 70 optimization to App Install and app purchases in the quarter after some of the testing that showed really good results. And we're seeing advertisers benefit from that now. And then we've shared some case studies also in the letter to that effect. We also began testing value optimization in Q2, and we see some really good results from that in the early going, which is promising. And then you've also got the ongoing momentum of really strong CAP adoption. That was up 300% year-over-year which is, of course, an improved -- a driver of improved performance. So taken together, that's contributing to a business on the DR side that's highly performing and has some ongoing growth behind it. And you can see that also reflected in the really strong growth we're seeing in active advertisers there. We shared earlier that we saw active advertisers more than double year-over-year in Q2. And obviously, that's reflective of some really strong growth we're seeing in the SMC segment. And of course, there's a number of drivers behind that, including the progress we're making with Snap Promote some of the things we're seeing around automated campaign setup tools to make it easier to get started and realize positive ROA quickly for those customers. And then also some improvements in our go-to-market operations there on the SMC side in order to help us focus on acquiring and supporting clients where we have a really good product market fit. So that business, there's a reason why we've been very focused on investing in this business because it's performance-based tends to be more resilient, and the growth there is a little bit more stable. I think over time, what you're seeing in the -- on the brand side is there are a couple of things that led to the decel there from the prior quarter. We mentioned one of them on the last call, which is just that there's some timing of some events and holidays in Q2 that were a bit of a headwind, but that was known going into the quarter. I think the portion of the demand performance in Q2 that was particularly disappointing in some of the weakness that we've seen in particular consumer discretionary verticals, including technology, entertainment and retail that we mentioned earlier. And so when I'm thinking about that business, we've built a very large brand-oriented business over the years. And we have very performing brand products for our advertisers to allow us to reach our very large community at scale when they have big events and whatnot. But we've also learned over time that, that brand business can be very volatile, which is again why we focused a lot on investing in the DR business. So I think a really good example what we can see in moments of volatility like this or where we're seeing in moments where maybe the economic environment is tougher and people start moving down funnel with their marketing investments is that we do particularly well in verticals where we have really good performance for Direct Response. And so I think a good example of a vertical that fits that is restaurants. In the most recent quarter, I think you've probably seen lots of economic data suggesting that the environment for restaurants has been a little tougher in some cases, but that's a category that continues to grow for us on the DR side in the current quarter because we've got great performance for those advertisers, and they've been able to continue to invest and grow their business on the back of that. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit clearer understanding of the dichotomy there. And then as we move into Q3, maybe I'll share a little bit of color on how we thought about our revenue guide for Q3. To start off with, we shared the expectation for top line growth in Q3 would be 12% to 16% year-over-year. First of all, just to put that in context, that implies quarter-over-quarter growth of 8% to 11%, which historically speaking, would be a really strong quarter-over-quarter result for Q3. And we are off to a good start to begin the new quarter, which is reflected in that. And I think if you step back and look on a 2-year stack basis, can give a little bit more context too, that implies 18% to 22% on a 2-year stack which would be a significant step up from the 11% to 12% that we've seen in the first half of this year. So hopefully, that puts the guide into Q3 into a little bit more context. Specifically, we expect more of this trend of the business and its growth going forward to continue to be driven by strong performance from the DR business. We've got a great road map there and of course, continued contributions from Snapchat+ which other revenue, which comprised mostly of subscription revenue up 150% plus year-over-year and now at a run rate of over $100 million a quarter. So those are the big areas we're seeing -- expecting to see drivers from the brand side, we've not assumed that we would see a big rebound in Q3. Now certainly, you called out some events like the Olympics, and we've got a great lineup of content around the Olympics. We've got creators at the Olympics covering things we've had lots of participation in athletes. The content on the platform has been terrific. And of course, we do see brand spending around halo events like that. But at a high level across the entirety of the quarter, we've not built a huge recovery in that brand business in there. We're expecting the step up in improvements in the business in Q3 to come predominantly from the DR and Snapchats+ business in the coming quarters. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit better sense of how the business has been progressing year-to-date and what we expect things to look like as we go into the next quarter. Thanks for the question. Hey Richard, thanks for the question. I think just diving in a little bit on the Q3 guide and how to think about the projections for ad revenue and DR revenue specifically, I think it's important to just remember that there was a 9-point percentage point acceleration in overall revenue in the prior year from Q2 to Q3. And it was actually a slightly faster than that acceleration for the Direct Response business. So I think to put it in a little bit more finer context, at sort of the midpoint of our guidance range for the coming quarter, we'd be overcoming almost all of that 9-point acceleration in the prior year. So we'd essentially be nearly keeping pace. And at the high end of our range, we'd be fully keeping pace with that acceleration for the prior year. And just to put a finer point on that, I want to sort of reiterate that guide implies an 8% to 11% quarter-over-quarter improvement in the overall business, which I think if you look historically across periods, is a very good result for Q3. And then to maybe even look at it another way is to think about it on a 2-year stack where the guide for Q3 implies 18% to 22% for Q3, and that's up from 12% in Q1 and 11% for Q2 of this year. So I think it's really tough to characterize that guide in Q3 is representing a business that's not improving. And you've got a pretty solid road map on the DR side. But I'll turn it over to Evan to talk a little bit more about the other parts of your question. Hey there, thanks for the question. I think probably the most important thing to sort of zoom in on when we're talking about how we're beginning into the new quarter and what's assumed in the guide is probably a little bit of what I touched on earlier on the assumption essentially in the -- the revenue guide that the growth that we're going to see in Q3, will continue to be driven predominantly by the direct response business and the ongoing momentum we've got there as well as the continued momentum of the Snapchat+ business. So there's not an assumption built into that guide that we're going to see significantly improved or really significant turnaround in the brand performance in the quarter. Obviously, we're working hard on that. We've been delivering some innovations for customers there with some stuff we announced at new fronts and other things we've talked about in a letter there. So I would sort of think of it that way. What we're really focused on here, and I think you've heard us talk about this and deliver on it consistently over the last 18 months is the investments we're putting into product and go-to-market around DR and a really keen focus around delivering ad products and optimizations that deliver performance results for advertisers that they can scale on and having go-to-market operations that are wrapped around those solutions and deliver to customers, we have strong product market fit from. I think you're going to see us continue to lean into the momentum we're seeing in the small and medium-sized customer front and some of the optimized campaign setups that we're delivering there continuing to lean into Snap Promote, continuing to deliver performance results for those folks as well. So building on what have been our strategic priorities for the last 18 to 24 months and building on the results that we saw in the most recent quarter around our DR and Snapchat+ verticals. So hopefully that helps a little."

Q2 marked an important milestone for Snap as we reached more than 850 million monthly active users and 432 million daily active users on the path to our goal of 1 billion monthly active users. Our focus on visual communication between friends and family is a strategic advantage that has enabled us to serve more than 75% of 13 to 34-year-olds in over 25 countries. As Snapchat has grown, our community has grown with us, and approximately 80% of Snapchatters are above the age of 18. We also continue to broaden and deepen engagement with our content platform in Q2, with global content viewers growing 12% year-over-year, and global time spent watching content growing 25% year-over-year. The growth of our community, the progress we have made with our direct response advertising business, and the success of our Snapchat Plus subscription business that now reaches more than 11 million subscribers, all contributed to revenue growth of 16% year-over-year, despite the impact of a weaker brand advertising environment for certain consumer discretionary verticals. We are pleased with the ongoing progress made in our DR business as well as well as the continued rapid growth in the total number of active advertisers which more than doubled year-over-year in Q2. We believe this progress validates our strategy of focusing on growing our community and engagement, investing in our Direct Response advertising products, and diversifying our revenue growth with our subscription offering. The actions we have taken to optimize our cost structure have cleared a path to meaningful Adjusted EBITDA profitability and positive free cash flow. In Q2, the combination of topline progress and expense discipline translated to $55 million of Adjusted EBITDA and sets us up well for continued improvement in operating leverage as the year progresses. Adjusted EBITDA flow through, or the share of incremental year-over-year revenue that flowed through to Adjusted EBITDA, was 55% in Q2, up from 22% in Q1. Moving forward, we will continue to calibrate our investments carefully to ensure we build on this momentum, while also realizing the operating leverage necessary to drive improved financial performance. We believe that the strong financial foundation we are building and our track record of innovation position us well to fulfill our long-term vision for augmented reality. Visual communication is at the core of the Snapchat experience. Our strategy to drive Daily Active User growth and engagement is focused on improving the way Snapchatters communicate and interact with their friends, family, and the world. We have delivered a number of new communication features and user experience enhancements in recent months to execute on this strategic initiative. For example, in Q2, we introduced Map Reactions that enable Snapchatters to send their favorite emojis to friends on the Snap Map to start conversations. We also launched Editable Chats, which allow Snapchatters to edit messages up to five minutes after sending them, and My AI Reminders that give Snapchatters the ability to ask for a reminder for an upcoming deadline. In addition, we are investing to enhance iOS app performance by making improvements to battery management, app and screen loading latency, and camera quality. We are also leveraging machine learning and generative AI to help our community form meaningful connections and to deliver engaging product experiences. These improvements have contributed to all-time highs in the number of daily active users sending Snaps in every region, which is an important input to sustained daily engagement. The results of these initiatives are reflected in our global community reaching 432 million Daily Active Users in Q2, an increase of 10 million quarter-over-quarter. Daily Active Users in North America was 100 million, down by less than 1% year-over-year, but up quarter-over-quarter as our initiatives to improve the way Snapchatters communicate begin to show early signs of progress. DAU in Europe was 97 million, compared to 96 million in the prior quarter and 94 million in the prior year. DAU in Rest of World was 235 million, compared to 226 million in the prior quarter and 202 million in the prior year. To further deepen content engagement, we continue to invest in our ML models to improve content ranking and personalization across all of our content surfaces. As a result, we are seeing significant improvement in content engagement, with global time spent watching content growing 25% year-over-year and 10% quarter-over-quarter in Q2, driven by strong growth in total time spent watching Spotlight and Creator Stories. In North America, some of our changes have been disruptive, and this contributed to mixed results on time spent with content, which declined by just under 2% on a year-over-year basis while increasing nearly 6% on a quarter-over-quarter basis in Q2. North America content engagement trends improved as we moved through the quarter, and time spent with content increased year-over-year in the month of June. In Q2, we continued to make progress unifying the ranking models between Spotlight and Stories to a single backend stack that ranks all content types to deliver the most engaging content to our community, regardless of format. To expand our content supply, we are focused on growing our creator community and making it easier for creators to submit and subsequently share compelling content. These efforts contributed in part to the number of creators submitting Spotlight content growing more than 20% year-over-year in Q2. We are also working with publisher partners to bring new and engaging content to our community. For example, in Q2, we announced Snap Nation, an evolution in our existing partnership with Live Nation that gives Snapchatters access to tour and festival experiences, including exclusive behind-the-scenes content and live music experiences. Augmented reality continues to inspire communication, and Snapchatters play with AR Lenses billions of times per day on average. In Q2, the number of Snapchatters sharing AR Lens experiences with their friends increased 12% year-over-year, driven by the popularity of innovative generative AI Lenses and improved ranking and optimization of our AR experiences. For example, our ML Scribble World Lens, which enables Snapchatters to transform into artistic, cartoon-style versions of themselves, was viewed over 1 billion times in Q2, and our 90s AI Lens was viewed by more than 20% of U.S. Snapchatters. In addition, we launched a generative AI Lens in collaboration with Beyonce\u0301, dedicated to her new COWBOY CARTER album, which was engaged with 80 million times in the first three days. We continue to improve our AR ranking technology in order to personalize the AR experience and deliver relevant AR content to our community. We recently enabled dynamic, ML-driven Lens ranking based on Snapchatter preferences, and we improved the quality of Lens ranking model predictions for AR Snaps. These initiatives contributed to a 10% year-over-year increase in Snap Story posts with an AR Lens globally. Our progress in AR is powered by our Lens Studio developer platform and the hundreds of thousands of creators who have leveraged this platform. In Q2, we released Lens Studio 5.0, which features our new GenAI Suite, powered by proprietary SnapML technology, that enables Lens creators to generate Lenses in minutes using a text prompt that requires no coding by the creator. The response to our new tools in Lens Studio has been inspiring and reinforces our belief that long-term success in AR requires a vibrant developer and creator ecosystem. As we move forward, we are focused on innovating and enhancing our core product experiences in order to grow our global community and deepen engagement. We believe continued progress on these initiatives is a critical input to both serving our community and expanding our monetization opportunity over time. We look forward to sharing more of our progress at our Snap Partner Summit on September 17. We continued to make progress on three foundational advertising platform initiatives, including larger ML models, improved signals, and more performant ad formats. Our 7-0 optimization for purchases continues to drive encouraging results for advertising partners. For example, Ridge, an everyday essentials e-commerce company, continued to lean into Snap's DR best practices to drive success. Leveraging 7-0 Optimization, Conversions API, and our ML-based Auto-Bidding, Ridge drove a 73% higher ROAS compared to their prior campaign strategy. For app-based advertisers, we have invested in improvements across the entire ad stack. We made ad format enhancements and streamlined the app download experience on iOS, so that Snapchatters can install apps without leaving Snapchat. Early testing shows that the enhanced app download experience is driving lower cost per install and improved ROAS for advertisers. We also expanded 7-0 Optimization to app install and app purchase and, after testing showed consistent improvement in cost-per-install and cost-per-purchase, we recently began scaling these products with our advertising partners. We are encouraged to see that a number of gaming app clients, including Roblox, are seeing a 30\u201350% improvement in ROAS on Snapchat. We have also begun testing Value Optimization, which allows advertisers to bid on the value of purchases, and we are seeing encouraging early results. We anticipate that mobile gaming and e-commerce advertisers in particular will benefit from these new optimizations. For example, Lanco\u0302me, a beauty brand from L'Ore\u0301al, leveraged our new Value Optimization with the aim of increasing average purchase cart size and ROAS. The campaign exceeded expectations and delivered a 38% increase in average purchase cart size and a 4.4x increase in ROAS Our DR ad platform relies on scaled privacy-centric signals that advertisers can use to optimize their ad campaigns. Conversions API, our privacy-centric first-party signal solution, is driving improved results for advertisers. For example, European e-commerce company My Jewellery saw their campaign deliver 156% higher last click ROAS and 13% lower cost-per-visit after implementing CAPI. In addition, we announced several partnerships, including Snowflake, Datahash, LiveRamp, and Tealium, to make it easier for advertisers to adopt Conversions API in a seamless and privacy-centric way. Our improvements to Conversions API, improved collaboration with advertisers, and growth in partner integrations resulted in Conversions API integrations growing over 300% year-over-year in Q2. We are excited by the progress we're seeing with our small and medium-size business advertising partners. Today, SMBs and creators alike can promote their services, content, or products, reach new audiences, and gain more followers, all in just a few taps within Snapchat. In addition, we launched useful tools such as dynamic campaign setup recommendations and codeless Pixel setups to help businesses achieve higher ROAS. These changes have been instrumental in the growth of SMB advertisers on Snapchat, which contributed in part to total active advertisers more than doubling year-over-year in Q2. This quarter, we continued to build compelling advertising products to help our brand advertising partners reach the Snapchat community at scale. For example, at our NewFronts presentation, we announced a number of sponsorship opportunities, including our partnership with NBCUniversal for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, where some of our most popular creators will share stories of the games with their unique perspectives and on-the-ground access in Paris. We also renewed our longstanding sports partnerships with the NFL, NBA, and WNBA, to provide official content across Stories and Spotlight for our community. In an effort to drive incremental performance for brands, we recently announced the Snap Advanced Partner Program, which will offer qualifying agencies and advertisers personalized training and enablement sessions, dedicated support, and additional tools and resources to enhance their campaigns. Our sponsored AR advertising solutions offer marketers the opportunity to leverage unique and engaging augmented reality experiences that lift the measurable performance of their brand campaigns. Specifically, research has shown that campaigns that pair AR Ads with Video Ads on Snapchat deliver 1.6x ad awareness lift when compared to Video Ads alone. Research from our partnership with OMD and Amplified Intelligence found that Snapchat campaigns that include AR in their mix drive 5x more active attention compared to industry peers. In order to expand the reach and impact of our AR advertising solutions, we recently launched AR Extensions for businesses, which extend our AR advertising products beyond the camera to all of our ad surfaces, including our Dynamic Product Ads, Snap Ads, Collection Ads, Commercials, and Spotlight. As we move forward, we have conviction that our continued focus on improving our ad platform and delivering solutions that drive measurable business results for our advertising partners is the key to building a larger and more durable advertising business. With the most important foundational elements of our advertising platform now in place, we look forward to making further progress on helping our advertising partners grow their businesses. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Derek to discuss our financial results. Thanks, Dan. I think just at a high level, we're incredibly excited by what we're seeing with small and medium-sized advertisers. I think our SMC business overall is probably the most important driver of long-term revenue growth for us over the coming years. So to really see that progress there has been really exciting. From a road map and automation perspective, automation is vitally important for these advertisers and it can really reduce the friction in terms of getting started and then ultimately growing spend on Snap. I think if you look at some of the enhancements we've made for SMC advertisers, we're getting better at inferring SMC advertiser objectives when they sign up for an account on Snapchat and then we direct those customers to preconfigured campaign setups. And that can be really helpful for getting folks started. We also offer tools like codeless signal set up, for example, that are very useful. I do think there's more we can do on automation, especially in terms of creative optimization as well as budget optimization. We have some improvements coming there. I think -- more specifically, we're thinking ahead to the holiday season. So as I look at e-commerce, SMC advertisers, we're really focused on things like product selection, leveraging on and off platform, privacy-safe signals, doing more work to drive in session conversions with some major model updates we've been working on. And then overall streamlining the checkout experience, which we think is really important for driving more of those in-section conversions. Those in-section conversions are some of the most incremental conversions. They're really valuable to SMC advertisers. I think in terms of the top of funnel for the SMC business, 1 of the big drivers there has been Snap Promote, which allows advertisers to get started in app. We reached over 850 million users on a monthly basis. And so I think we've just been really excited to see that their passion for our service and their usage of our service has also, I think, encouraged them to try out Snapchat for growing their business with our advertising tools. So I do think the Snapchat community overall will be a great source of growth for our SMC business, and we're very focused on growing that both in the near term, but more importantly, as a real long-term driver of our growth. Yes. Thanks, Katy. I think as we look at the brand business, the most important thing is really driving performance for advertisers. And -- our solutions are very performant, whether advertisers are measuring performance with our first-party tools or with MM or MTA, results and I think more recently with some of our conversion lift solutions. So we continue to help advertisers really measure what matters most to them. And I think one of the most important things, especially as we look at brand spend in the back half is the relationship between brand spend and lower funnel performance. And I think some of the most sophisticated advertisers are really leveraging full funnel solutions because building that brand awareness is really important in terms of improving overall conversion rates on the lower funnel. So I think as we get into the back half of the year, really working with our advertising partners to make sure they're leveraging our full funnel offering and our performance brand solutions will be really important. And then I think in terms of the progress we're making on content engagement, especially in North America, the team has had a bit of a split focus over the past couple of quarters, we've been building out a whole new back-end ranking stack that combines stories and Spotlight. We think that's a better experience for our community because it combines both types of content that they really love. Spotlight has been a real bright spot for us in terms of growth and engagement and so have creator stories. And then, of course, as always, a friend stories. People love to see what their friends are up to. So being able to combine all those content types rather than requiring our community to go to different places to get those different types of content, I think we'll be very positive for the content experience on Snapchat. But maintaining our existing production content stack while building a whole new combined stack has been a bit of a challenge and what the team's focus. And I think that contributed to a little bit of the choppiness we saw through the quarter. But ultimately, as we look at North America engagement overall, both North America, DAU and content time spend were both up quarter-over-quarter. So directionally positive as we really work to make progress there. Thanks, Rich, for the question. And we've definitely been working hard on the content experience. We know how important content is to our community and also in terms of just the way that they maintain their relationships by sharing content with one another. When we look at the content experience, as I mentioned, we really want to combine stories and spotlight, which are both beloved content types on Snapchat but are now located in two different tabs on the app. And that just makes content discovery just have a bit more friction. It also doesn't take advantage of the overall supply that we have across both stories and spotlight. And we know that combining that supply will help us provide more relevant content to folks based on their interest and will allow us to leverage signals across both of those content types. So if you think about the steps to get there, 1 is sort of a user interface change that combines both the stories and short video user interface, so that has been in testing. There's also the infrastructure piece of it to combine both content types and rank across both content types, which is nontrivial because the objective function has to work across the way that those different types of content are consumed. That's also in testing, where you'll see that first is actually in spotlight, where we've made progress, for example, adding publisher stories and have been testing that combined the content experience. And of course, we'll have a bunch more to share at the upcoming Snap Partner Summit, which is on September 17. Hope to see you there. Thanks so much for the question. We've definitely been excited about the growth in spotlight time spend, the uptake of that service. And certainly, it's been a source of inventory growth for us. I think if I compare time spent on spotlight to other short video services, I think we have an enormous amount of headroom on Snapchat. That's part of the reason why we focus so much on this combined content experience, we know how much our community loves stories, and we really believe that a combined experience that combines the stories format with short-form video will be most compelling and easiest to use, especially in terms of content discovery. So the team has been working very hard on that. We continue to make progress in terms of model improvements. We've seen some great growth in terms of spotlight submissions and that's helping with overall content supply. One big area of focus for us in the coming months is really around model freshness and making sure that we are updating our models quickly enough to learn from engagement with new pieces of content so that we can serve the freshest possible original content to our community and not have to wait for days in some cases, for us to understand and leverage that signal. So a lot to do there, but certainly, I'm pleased with the growth so far and excited to get the combined content experience out to our community. Thank you so much for the question. Opening to the camera has always been a really important part of the Snapchat experience, especially because it keeps you grounded in the real world with your friends rather than distracting you with content created by other people. And that prompt to create and express yourself is something that's really important to the Snapchat product. It starts -- helps people start new conversations when they share a Snap or helps them share what they're seeing and experiencing with their friends if they add that snap to their story. And of course, it's an amazing top of funnel for our augmented reality platform where hundreds of millions of Snapchatters engage with lenses on a regular basis. So I think opening to the camera is really a unique part of the Snapchat experience and part of what really differentiates our service. And I think given the strength we've seen now, I think it's been almost, what, 13 years that we've been working on Snapchat, we continue to see new highs in terms of the number of unique Snap centers, which were up across hit record highs across all regions in the quarter. So I think the strength of the core product and that prompt to really express yourself and share with your close friends and family is something that's really unique to Snap and differentiates our service. I do think, though, and I don't want to run too much of the surprise with the Snap Partner Summit coming up. But there is an opportunity, I believe, to help simplify the Snapchat experience overall, and that's something we have been working towards, and we look forward to sharing more at the Summit. Thanks so much for the question. I've certainly been spending a lot more of my time over the past year or so on the monetization side of the business. And I think just looking at the long-term strength of the business and our opportunity in augmented reality. I think a personal goal and maybe a broader growth for the business is really to have our revenue resilience match the engagement resilience we see on our platform with our community of 850 million people around the world. I think over the years, we've seen that, that engagement has really been durable, and we've been able to continue to grow service. I think as I look at the revenue side of things, what really excites me and a big area of focus and investment for us in the coming year will be the small and medium-sized customer segment. I think it really leverages the strength of our scale with our community and also our ability on the product and engineering side to drive results for advertisers. And ultimately, we really believe that, that will result in much more resilient revenue from a diversified customer base, and that's a sort of foundation we want to be building our business on for the long-term. So certainly a continued focus on the monetization side, especially with small, medium-sized customers and then making a lot of progress on foundationally on our machine learning models and our ability to drive performance."

[Operator Instructions] \n I would now like to turn the call over to David Ometer, Head of Investor Relations. \nDavid Ometer: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Snap's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call.

Please refer to our filings with the SEC to understand how we calculate any of the metrics discussed on today's call. \n With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Evan. \nEvan Spiegel: Hi, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. I'm excited to share the progress we are making on our strategic priorities and the momentum we are building to capitalize on the long-term potential of our business. I'm deeply inspired by the dedication and efforts so many of our team members have put into serving our community and our partners, and it is gratifying to see our efforts beginning to bear fruit. \n On our call today, I'll open with some observations about our strategic direction and key developments and then you'll hear from Derek. The full financial detail is in our investor letter, but going forward, we'll also be giving more context on the earnings call. \n We remain committed to executing against our 3 strategic priorities: accelerating and diversifying our revenue growth, growing our community and deepening their engagement and leading in augmented reality. The most important strategic priority we set out for 2024 is accelerating and diversifying revenue growth. We have made significant progress to start the year with revenue growing 21% year-over-year, an acceleration of 16 percentage points over the prior quarter growth rate, which was driven by improvements we have made to our advertising platform and an increase in demand for our advertising solutions while also benefiting from the impact of an improved operating environment. \n Our large hard-to-reach audience, brand-safe environment and continued innovation and progress on our advertising platform have made us a valuable partner for businesses that want to reach the next generation. \n Our second strategic priority, designing innovative products and services that enhance people's relationships with their friends, family and the world continues to drive the growth of our global community. \n In Q1, we reached 422 million daily active users, an increase of 39 million or 10% year-over-year. We continue to broaden and deepen engagement with our content platform with the number of viewers and total time spent watching content growing globally year-over-year. Our focus on visual communication between friends and family is a strategic advantage that has enabled us to reach more than 75% of 13 to 34 year olds in over 25 countries with these countries representing more than 50% of the global advertising market. \n Relationships are what drive the depth of engagement on our platform. Our goal is to ensure that Snapchat helps enhance relationships with the people who matter most. These relationships lead to increased daily active usage of our platform and happier members of our community. 4 out of 5 Snapchatters believe that connecting with friends is the simplest way to feel better. This year, we are particularly focused on helping lightly engaged new and resurrected Snapchatters build relationships on our platform. Building just 1 or 2 close relationships on Snapchat and dramatically increase the number of active days for these cohorts while simultaneously leading to a happier and healthier community. Over 90% of Snapchatters say they feel comfortable, happy and connected when they use Snapchat. And Snapchat is ranked as the #1 happiest platform when compared to other apps. \n We've been working hard to improve our advertising platform by helping our partners transition to new ways of measuring and optimizing their advertising spend in order to provide improved ROAS. In Q1, ongoing momentum with our 7-0 pixel purchase optimization model led to a more than 75% increase in purchase-related conversions year-over-year. \n In addition, we are excited by the progress we're seeing with our small- and medium-sized advertising partners. Today, small- and medium-sized businesses and creators can promote their services, content or products and reach new audiences, all with just a few taps within the Snap chat application. This has been instrumental in significantly accelerating the number of SMB advertisers on Snapchat, which increased 85% year-over-year. \n As we look forward, the deliberate actions we've taken with our cost structure have cleared a path to meaningful adjusted EBITDA profitability and positive free cash flow. We have invested heavily in cloud infrastructure over the past year in order to improve the performance of our advertising products and deepen engagement on our platform. \n We will continue to calibrate our investments carefully moving forward to ensure we build on this momentum while also realizing the operating leverage necessary to drive improved financial performance. \n We believe that a strong financial foundation and track record of innovation are critical inputs in fulfilling our vision of computing overlaid on the world. This is our third strategic priority. We have never worked on anything as profound and meaningful as augmented reality. AR enables us to service digital experiences seamlessly in the world around us, transforming the way we use computing in our daily lives. \n Our AR products and services are driving major impact at scale today. On average, over 300 million people engage with augmented reality every single day on Snapchat. Our community plays with AR Lenses billions of times per day on average, and our AR creator community has built millions of lenses using our Lens Studio software. \n Having a large, engaged AR audience and creator community enables us to innovate rapidly. This unique position has allowed us to develop a lead and augmented reality over the last decade by leveraging one of the world's most used cameras developing highly advanced technology and tools and growing a vibrant AR creator ecosystem. \n We believe that our large and growing community, an innovative and engaging service that continues to evolve and a strong balance sheet with positive free cash flow positions us well to achieve our long-term vision for augmented reality, which we believe will be one of the most meaningful advancements in computing that the world has ever seen. \n With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Derek to speak about our financials. \nDerek Andersen: Thanks, Evan, and good afternoon, everyone. For the first quarter, revenue and adjusted EBITDA exceeded our expectations as a result of increased demand for our advertising solutions and an improved cost structure that enabled us to generate greater operating leverage. Q1 revenue grew 21% year-over-year to $1.195 billion, driven by the 14 percentage point acceleration in advertising revenue, which grew 16% year-over-year in Q1. The Direct Response, or DR portion of advertising revenue increased 17% year-over-year, up from 3% growth in the prior quarter as we began to see improved ROAS for our advertising partners, translate into accelerating demand on our ad platform. .\n Small- and medium-sized advertisers, in particular, grew quickly in Q1, with active advertisers in this segment, up 85% year-over-year. Brand-oriented advertising revenue increased 12% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for our takeover products in Q1 and an improved operating environment.\n We also continue to make progress towards diversifying our revenue sources with other revenue up 194% year-over-year to reach $87 million. Other revenue includes all nonadvertising revenue and consists almost entirely of Snapchat+ subscription revenue. Snapchat+ subscribers topped 9 million in Q1, more than tripling year-over-year. From a regional perspective, we observed acceleration in both DR and brand-related advertising revenue growth across all regions in Q1. \n We were particularly pleased to see the improvements we have made to our ad platform translate to improved revenue growth in North America, where revenue grew 16% year-over-year in Q1, an acceleration of 14 percentage points over the prior quarter growth rate. \n Brand-oriented demand in Rest of World and Europe accelerated at a relatively faster pace in Q1 as these regions were more significantly impacted by the war in the Middle East in the prior quarter. We observed the highest rate of acceleration in total advertising revenue growth in Rest of World in Q1, driven in part by strong seasonal demand during the Ramadan holiday, which was further amplified by the timing of the holiday season shifting into Q1 of the current year. \n Total adjusted cost of revenue was $570 million in Q1, up 31% year-over-year. Infrastructure costs were the largest driver of the year-over-year increase driven in large part by the ramp in ML and AI investments to support our DR ad platform and content engagement that we implemented in Q2 and Q3 of the prior year. \n The level of investment in ML and AI was relatively stable across Q4 of 2023 and Q1 of 2024, and we have continued to improve our cloud infrastructure unit costs through a combination of engineering efficiency and pricing improvements. \n In addition, we benefited from higher-than-average service provider credits in Q1 that helped to further reduce infrastructure costs in Q1. As a result, infrastructure cost per DAU declined from $0.84 in Q4 of 2023 to $0.80 in Q1 of 2024. \n The remaining components of adjusted cost of revenue, including content, developer, advertising and other partner costs were $232 million in Q1 or 19% of revenue, compared to 20% in the prior quarter and 21% in the prior year. \n Adjusted gross margin was 52% in Q1 compared to 55% in the prior quarter and 56% in the prior year. The quarter-over-quarter decline in adjusted gross margin is driven entirely by seasonally lower revenue in Q1 compared to Q4, partially offset by the sequential decline in infrastructure costs per DAU. \n The year-over-year decline in adjusted gross margin reflects higher infrastructure investments that began to ramp up in Q2 and Q3 of the prior year, which was partially offset by operating leverage from accelerating revenue growth in Q1. \n Adjusted operating expenses were $579 million in Q1, up 5% year-over-year. Personnel costs increased 4% year-over-year in Q1, driven primarily by the impact of higher personnel costs per regular full-time employee, which was partially offset by reductions in team size as a result of the restructuring initiatives. \n We implemented the restructuring in phases throughout the quarter, resulting in a 3% decline in average headcount year-over-year. We ended Q1 with 4,835 full-time headcount, which was down 7% year-over-year and down 27% from our peak headcount in mid-Q3 of 2022. \n Adjusted EBITDA was $46 million in Q1, up from $1 million in Q1 of the prior year, reflecting both accelerating revenue growth and operating expense discipline. \n Net loss was $305 million in Q1 compared to $329 million in Q1 of the prior year. The improvement in net loss on a year-over-year basis reflects the flow-through of higher adjusted EBITDA, as well as a $60 million reduction in stock-based compensation and related expenses, or SBC, partially offset by transition costs of $70 million related to our restructuring initiatives. \n The impact of past refresh grants on the GAAP accounting of SBC expense has now fully dissipated from the cost structure. This was the largest driver of the year-over-year decline in SBC in Q1 followed by the impact of reduced headcount as a result of the recent restructuring. Dilution or growth in our share count was 3.8% in Q1, down from 5.7% in the prior quarter. \n As part of our efforts to responsibly manage the impact of SBC on our share count, we repurchased 21 million shares at a cost of $235 million in Q1, reflecting an average repurchase price of $11.19. Since we began opportunistically managing our share count through share repurchases in Q3 of 2022, we have repurchased 145 million shares, representing 8% of fully diluted shares outstanding at an average price of $9.86 per share and a total cost of $1.4 billion. Free cash flow was $38 million in Q1, as we continued to strategically prioritize our investments to drive sustained and meaningful positive free cash flow. We ended Q1 with $2.9 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand. \n In addition, in Q1, we repurchased $100 million of our outstanding 2025 convertible notes and $351 million of our outstanding 2026 convertible notes at prices below par value. Through these transactions, we have further reduced the level of debt maturing in the years ahead, while also eliminating the risk of future dilution from the repurchased convertible notes. \n Turning to our outlook. We anticipate continued growth of our global community and our Q2 guidance is built on the assumption that DAU will be approximately $431 million in Q2. Our Q2 guidance range for revenue is $1.225 billion, to $1.255 billion, implying year-over-year revenue growth of 15% to 18%. \n This would represent a 3 to 6 percentage point deceleration in growth rate compared to Q1, which we attribute to the 3 percentage point quarter-over-quarter acceleration in revenue growth experienced in the prior year and a further estimated 3 percentage point headwind due to changes in seasonality factors, including the timing of the Ramadan holiday season shifting toward Q1 in the current year and the impact of the leap day in Q1 of 2021. \n Our investment plans for Q2 include modest incremental investments in infrastructure, personnel and marketing to sustain the momentum we have established in our business, as well as the impact of an increasing legal and regulatory burden on our cost structure. \n Given the revenue range above and our investment plans for the quarter ahead, we estimate that adjusted EBITDA will be between $15 million and $45 million in Q2. \n We have made significant progress to optimize our cost structure and believe it will be productive to provide forward-looking insights into our estimated full year 2024 cost structure. We currently estimate that quarterly infrastructure cost per DAU will be in the $0.83 to $0.85 range for the remainder of 2024. \n We will continue to assess our infrastructure investment levels based on what is in the best long-term interest of our business. We expect the remaining components of cost of revenue, including content and developer partner costs as well as advertising partner and other costs to remain relatively stable as a percentage of revenue at a combined 19% to 21% of revenue, which is within the range we have reported over the trailing 4 quarters. \n We currently anticipate that the headcount and personnel costs will grow modestly as we move through 2024, resulting in full year adjusted operating expenses of approximately $2.425 billion to $2.525 billion. We see limited opportunity to productively reduce adjusted operating expenses below this range. And if we are able to sustain higher rates of revenue growth into the second half of 2024, we will invest prudently to support that growth. For SBC, we anticipate modest sequential growth as we move through 2024, resulting in an estimated full year SBC expense of $1.13 billion to $1.2 billion. \n With that, I'll kick it back to Evan for closing remarks. \nEvan Spiegel: Thanks, Derek. As we continue to execute in the quarters ahead, we remain focused on serving our community with innovative and responsible products, investing in our direct response business to deliver measurable ROAS for our advertising partners, cultivating new sources of revenue to diversify our top line growth and scaling our investment levels prudently to deliver meaningful and sustained profitability and positive free cash flow. The most critical input to delivering on these strategic initiatives we laid out is innovation. That includes innovating on our products, our advertising platform and the future of augmented reality. \n We believe that our demonstrated track record of innovation over the last 12 years positions us well to deliver on this for our community, our partners and our investors. While there is still a lot of work to be done, we are pleased that this focus has translated into improved results in Q1. \n We will now begin our Q&A session. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. \nDouglas Anmuth: Can you just help us understand the drivers and you listed a number of things, but just help us kind of frame and maybe prioritize the drivers of the DR acceleration in 1Q? And just kind of how you think about linearity and progression through '24? And then if you could comment just on the slight decel that you're guiding to in the second quarter as well. \nDerek Andersen: Doug, it's Derek. Thanks for the question. I think, look, at the first outset, I would say that probably the most important takeaway or theme of the top line results is just how broad-based the acceleration was on the top line. You mentioned DR specifically, but we did see each of brand DR and those 2 pillars across all 3 of our regions accelerate in the quarter. We also saw that the SMB customer base grew quite quickly, active advertisers, they are up 85%. And also then looking over at the Snapchat+ business also subs tripling or more year-over-year to 9 million. So we did see a really broad-based improvement in the top line. \n On the DR side, specifically, I think you've probably seen that we've been making really significant investments in that line of business over the last year, and we made a lot of investments in infrastructure to help improve their number one, leveraging more of our privacy say, signals for ranking and optimization and then continuing to evolve our models to incorporate more of those signals making larger models and refreshing them more frequently. And we've seen really good momentum, in particular on the 7-0 pixel purchase optimization that led to more than 75% increase in purchase-related conversions in Q1. \n And we're making progress on some of the nuts and bolts there around, for example, CAPI adoption we saw a more than 300% increase year-over-year on that. And we now have coverage there of approximately half of the DR revenue. And you made some improvements just in expanding the addressable market there, with the rollout of 7-0 optimization to app install and app purchase with additional app goals coming in Q2 on the road map there. \n So there's a lot of progress on that front. We're seeing that show up in improved rollouts. And I think many of you saw in your channel checks even in Q4 that you were starting to hear about the return on rollouts in the advertising community. And I think you can see that now showing up in the demand in this quarter. \n So if you taken together, I think that each of those are proof points that the DR business is performing much, much better now. And that each of those things are ROAS-based return-based customer success based and that speaks to sort of the durability of that basis. \n So you asked a little bit about the transition of the growth rate into Q2. And we do expect the progress that we've made with the DR business to continue but we do have some unique items just on seasonality. I pointed to a couple in the letter. One in particular, we did have an improvement in the growth rate in the prior year of about 3 percentage points quarter-over-quarter, so that contributes to comps a little. And then there's some unique seasonality factors as we transition from Q1 to Q2 this year, notably, the leap day in Q1 of this year that contributed to the higher growth in Q1 as well as the timing of the Ramadan holiday season, moving more so into Q1 this year relative to Q2 last year and that further contributes to some of the transitions there. But none of those factors really speaking to the fundamentals of the improvement in the business that we're seeing. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of a sense of what we're seeing and the momentum that we've established on that line of the business. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo. \nKenneth Gawrelski: Evan and Derek, you discussed on the fourth quarter earnings call, a shift in the company resources to grow engagement in North America and EMEA. Can you talk about any early progress? I know North America DAUs were flat quarter-over-quarter in 1Q, but maybe any early thoughts on future North America growth for 2Q and beyond and maybe that what's incorporated in that and the early look at 2Q DAUs, please? \nEvan Spiegel: Thanks, Ken. Yes, we certainly have been shifting more of our resourcing and focus to growth in North America and Europe. It's a different opportunity set. Historically, we were more focused on new users and developing markets who are typically on Android devices. This is really about focusing more on reengagement with users who have downloaded Snapchat before and who may not be using it as often as some of their friends and those users are typically on iOS. \n So I'd say the opportunity set overall is different. And in our early explorations, we're finding a lot of opportunity to improve that product experience. \n So the near-term and month-over-month trends have been pretty constructive growth from February to March and March to April month to date in North America has been positive. So we're making progress here. It is early, but we are seeing a lot of opportunity and eager to improve the product for our community in North America and Europe. . \nOperator: Our next question comes from Rich Greenfield with LightShed Partners. \nRichard Greenfield: Look, I think the -- Evan, when I look at the time spent watching content globally, it was up, but North America was relatively -- you sort of signaled the last couple of quarters, it's flattish. But you keep calling out Spotlight momentum. And it feels like if I think about how you shift time spent on the platform or grow time spent on the platform, it seems like Spotlights the key to unlocking meaningful growth. Yes, creator stores are growing, but especially as you unify the feed, it feels like spotlights so important. \n And I guess could you just -- as you look across the landscape, real short TikTok versus Spotlight. How do you evaluate where Spotlight is today on a relative basis versus the choices consumers have very similar? I realize it's not exact, but a similar experience. And how aggressively are you investing to take share with Spotlight? \nEvan Spiegel: Thanks, Rich. Yes, as we look at Spotlight and Creator stories, they've definitely been bright spots in terms of time spent. As you mentioned, we are really working to simplify and unify the experience, both in terms of the user perspective. So one unified feed of content, but also the ranking stack, which is going to enable us to really share signal engagement signals between stories and Spotlight, which we just haven't done historically. So we think that will really help personalize the experience overall. \n I'd say looking at the feedback from our community, one area where we can really improve is in making the content feel more timely and topical. We have a lot of great signals from our community about things that are trending, things that they're interested in, in a given moment. But we haven't done a very good job surfacing the corresponding content that we also have as well because people are making billions of snaps every day on Snapchat. \n So I think there's work to be done to make our content experience feel more timely and topical, and then we're spending a lot of focus on the creator journey overall. That journey from using Snapchat to communicate with 100 friends to growing a following of millions. And really making sure that people are creating great stories or great Spotlight content can be discovered and then grow that following and ultimately build a business over time. So that's been a big focus as well. Certainly, a big opportunity for us, and we're working away at it. \nOperator: Next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. \nRoss Sandler: Yes. So it sounds like you're upgrading revamping the app install or app kind of transaction category within the DR business. Can you just remind us like back in the day, how big that category... \nOperator: And it appears we lost connection with Ross. \n Our next question today comes from James Heaney with Jefferies. \nJames Heaney: Over the last few quarters, you've continued to grow your advertiser count at a pretty healthy clip. Can you guys just talk about this newer cohort of advertisers and what their propensity to spend looks like relative to older advertiser cohorts? And at what point do you feel like your SMB revenue starts to become more material? \nDerek Andersen: Thanks. I think to start, we're growing a newer segment of customers here, and I think that's really exciting to broadening out the overall base of advertisers. So I shared earlier in response to another question that we've seen the active advertiser count on the small and medium-sized customer base up to 85% year-over-year and it being the fastest-growing customer segment. So that is very exciting. \n And I think overall, you're seeing a broadening of the base of advertisers. There's a journey. I think that you're going to see advertisers go through in terms of one coming on to the platform, initial testing, seeing performance with some of these scaled self-serve products and then being able to grow and optimize. And of course, as we continue to bring more privacy safe signals into our models and invest in bigger models and get better and better at optimization and ranking, those products become more performant. They deliver better ROAS to those customers and they give them the ability to bid and expand their budget. \n So I do think there's a journey here. I think what's really exciting is to see the ad platform delivering the kind of results that can help us grow that customer base. Because over the long term, the small and medium-sized customer base is going to be an absolutely critical ingredient to reaching the full monetization potential of the business. So off to a good start and a lot of work to do to continue helping more of these advertisers through that journey. Hopefully, that context helps. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Morris with Guggenheim. \nMichael Morris: Wanted to ask you about spending and investment. Large companies in the technology sector are certainly increasing their investment in artificial intelligence infrastructure. Can you talk about your level of investment currently, whether you think that's sufficient? And how you think about your size and scale relative to larger players? And what it takes for you to continue to be competitive in connecting with your audience? \n And if I could just ask one follow-up on those statistics, Derek, that you reported and just shared about the CAPI integrations and the purchase conversions, the numbers are very large, far ahead of where your revenue growth is. Can you just talk about what it takes to get more of your customer base engaged with those? And can that drive acceleration in that revenue in the coming quarters and years? \nDerek Andersen: I can start around the scale and scope of the infrastructure investments, and you're going to see those show up in really a couple of places. Number one, we shared last year that we scaled up our ML and AI infrastructure spending into the range of about $100 million a quarter starting in Q2 and Q3 of last year. And then we shared that, that investment -- larger investments were relatively stable over the last 2 quarters. Obviously, with the full year range on infrastructure for Dow, stepping up from $0.80 in Q1 to $0.83 to $0.85 in the remaining quarters of the year. We've given ourselves room to invest more there. \n I think the important -- there's a couple of important things I would say, just to put our investment in perspective. One is that we're investing on a different model. Rather than CapEx, it's showing up as a cloud infrastructure cost that's running through cost of revenue. But two, there's a multiplier on that spend as an ongoing operating expense relative to the underlying CapEx it represents. \n So while we might be spending hundreds of millions a year currently on this type of infrastructure, the underlying capital is multiples of that. So the scale of the infrastructure that we have access to, to run our models is obviously much, much larger. And so that's giving the business access to a lot of capacity. \n And I think second and perhaps really over the long term, the most important thing is whether or not we're seeing the returns on that investment that are going to allow us to continue to scale that investment profitably for the business. And I think what you're seeing in the results in Q1 here are proof points that those investments that we've made in that infrastructure are paying off in significant and accelerating revenue growth and in particular, on the DR ad platform in addition to how it's contributing on the engagement side. And that's going to position the business to be able to continue to scale those investments ideally continue to see positive ROI on that like we have seen and grow our business over time. \n So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of perspective of how we're thinking. We're going to continue to reassess that. We've been really pleased with the ROI on those investments to date, and we've made room to scale them, and we'll continue to do that based on the data that we're getting back. \n On your second question related to CAPI integrations, we're really pleased with the momentum on the coverage that we've seen there. I'd mentioned that we're looking at about 50% demand-weighted coverage of our DR ad revenue and those integrations are up about 3x, 300% year-over-year. So obviously, good momentum in getting that adopted across our DR advertising customer base. \n And so really important, I think, to insulating the business going forward and helping our customers to have measurable results. And as I said in the answer to the prior question, the recipe here is getting people on board, getting them to adopt the right advertising solution for the objectives they're trying to achieve. \n And a good proof point on that is we are providing targeted offers to small- and medium-sized customers based on what we know about their business to recommend the right advertising product for them and advertisers that adopt those recommendations are seeing much improved results, and that's contributing in a scaled, self-served way, to people being able to meet their ROAS objectives, grow their business, which puts them in a position to invest more on our platform. \n So I think that's the recipe there in terms of us seeing that advertiser base scale. And we shared that 85% growth in the active advertisers in the segment to let you know that in addition to people making progress on these integrations, it's turning into a flywheel on the actual customer base. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit more context of what we see as the path there and how that's going. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Benjamin Black of Deutsche Bank. \nBenjamin Black: Great. Can you talk a little bit more about your build-out of the app value optimization? How meaningful could that be? Is there any risk of disruption to the app install business in that progress there? And perhaps more broadly, what are some of the other initiatives you have on the product road map over the next 12 to 18 months that you're excited about? . \nEvan Spiegel: Yes. Thanks so much for the question. On the app side, the biggest thing we've been working on lately is just landing these model updates. We, I guess, in the last week or so, have updated our app install models, both for scan and non-scan. So that's been great. And we now have our app install 7-0 and app purchase 7-0 products in testing. It's very early, but the results have been promising so far. \n We also have a new scan offering that we're just introducing to our customers. So we'll be excited to get their feedback and see how that can improve their performance, and we have a number of customers testing that already. \n I think value optimization will follow. We've really just been focused on driving more click-through installs at much lower CPIs for our advertising partners. And then we'll be working more on the value optimization piece. I think just broadly looking at the advertising platform, we have made a lot of progress, as Derek mentioned, on signals and running much larger unified models, of course, the ad interactions as well in the ad formats. \n I think sort of looking ahead, we've been working on things like product selection for our dynamic product ads product. We've been making progress with things like cold start, which is especially relevant for SMB advertisers at lower levels of spend to help them find success. So I think there's a lot more work to do, but we're building on a solid foundation now, and we've been able to make some very rapid progress. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Shmulik with Bernstein. \nMark Shmulik: A couple, if I may. The first just on Snap Stars. It sounds like it's growing quite well and really contributing to engagement. Just wanted to kind of ask how do we think about the philosophy as we think about onboarding more Snap Stars, more spotlight more broadcast out media and how does that fit in the long-term engagement strategy kind of balancing it with like deepening connections with friends, family and people you care about? \n And then just the second question for Derek. We've heard from others just on the recovery of the digital ad market, certain verticals coming back kind of quicker than others. Any color you can share just about the vertical mix you've seen? \nEvan Spiegel: Thanks so much for the question. Yes, as we look at content on Snapchat, I think the most successful content is really about relationships. And those can be relationships with your close friends and family, but it could also be relationships with Snap Stars. And that's the feedback we hear from Snap Stars as well that the engagement they have and the relationship they're able to build with their audience on Snapchat is really unparalleled. And one of the reasons why they love investing in our platform. \n As we look at scaling the Snap Star program, I'd say today, the focus is mostly around looking at countries, geographies where we're sort of under-indexed in investing in Snap Stars there so we can build out more local language content. \n We're also looking at interest. A lot of Snap Stars create content around their interests. That could be food or travel, sports, those sorts of things. And so we're really looking at this intersection of the geographies where we have Snap Stars and on the interest as well and really lining up with that up with our community and what they're looking for. \n So yes, I would say overall, to your point, relationships really do drive that content consumption on our service, and that's why Snap Stars are such an important part of our offering. \nDerek Andersen: In terms of color on the verticals and where we're seeing the operating environment generally as we went through Q1, number one, I think we've seen the improvement in the operating environment to be fairly broad into Q1 and that we did see certain regions particularly impacted by the war in the Middle East in Q4. \n And so that certainly we've seen demand, as we mentioned in the letter, really improve on that front quarter-over-quarter. But I think more broadly, we saw a much more robust brand environment, which played out in all of our regions in Q1. And then from a DR perspective, it's really about fit. And of course, with purchase optimization and the scale that self-serve SMB product is working really well. \n We've seen verticals such as CPG e-commerce restaurants and travel and SMBs broadly working really well. And I think what we're excited about is to be able to broaden that out to a wider set of customers as we introduce more of these out-based optimizations and start to address other verticals. So a much better environment in Q1 for sure. Thank you for the question. \nOperator: Our last question comes from Dan Salmon with New Street Research. \nDaniel Salmon: Can you hear me, okay? \nEvan Spiegel: Yes, we can. \nDaniel Salmon: Okay. Good. Sorry about that. So 2 questions. Evan, I'm just curious, any early learnings from your ad partnership with Amazon and whether or not you'd consider more ad partners that can bring incremental demand? Both Amazon and Google are cloud partners after all and it could be interesting. \n And then second for Derek, can we just go back to the SMB advertiser growth at 85%? I mean that's significant acceleration. Was there something like onetime in that? Or is that the type of level of growth you can expect throughout the year? \nEvan Spiegel: Yes, as we look at Amazon partnership and what they're doing with Handshake, I do think that's a great learning opportunity for us. It's still very early, but I think what's exciting is being able to bring relevant products to Amazon shoppers inside the Snapchat experience. We know that people now shop where they consume content and so to be able to offer a relevant product selection in line and allow people to check out with one tap is certainly an exciting product development. So we'll obviously continue to learn there and evolve that product. \n I do think just separately that some of these ad partnerships we've done and work we've done with other demand partners have been important elements of our growth, and we do see continued opportunity there. \nDerek Andersen: Dan, on the question about SMB, I would agree. I mean, that growth on the active advertisers is obviously a really important input to building what we hope will be a very big business for us over time. And we're early in the going. So there's a lot of opportunity set here both in terms of product market fit as we are able to have more optimizations that are going to appeal to a wider and wider audience in that SMB set. \n And I think we're learning a lot about how to use integration partners to help make it easier for these advertisers to onboard over time as well as the ability to work our funnels, whether that's from awareness to onboarding an acquisition to trial and discovery and through the scaling process of delivering ROAS for these partners. \n So we're early in the going there, but excited about the progress we're seeing so far, and it's something that we'll hope to build on as we go forward. So thanks for the questions. And hopefully, that gives you a little more perspective of how we're thinking about it. \nOperator: This concludes our Q&A session as well as Snap Inc. First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you all for attending today's session. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Derek Andersen",
            "content": "Thanks, Evan, and good afternoon, everyone. For the first quarter, revenue and adjusted EBITDA exceeded our expectations as a result of increased demand for our advertising solutions and an improved cost structure that enabled us to generate greater operating leverage. Q1 revenue grew 21% year-over-year to $1.195 billion, driven by the 14 percentage point acceleration in advertising revenue, which grew 16% year-over-year in Q1. The Direct Response, or DR portion of advertising revenue increased 17% year-over-year, up from 3% growth in the prior quarter as we began to see improved ROAS for our advertising partners, translate into accelerating demand on our ad platform. .\n Small- and medium-sized advertisers, in particular, grew quickly in Q1, with active advertisers in this segment, up 85% year-over-year. Brand-oriented advertising revenue increased 12% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for our takeover products in Q1 and an improved operating environment.\n We also continue to make progress towards diversifying our revenue sources with other revenue up 194% year-over-year to reach $87 million. Other revenue includes all nonadvertising revenue and consists almost entirely of Snapchat+ subscription revenue. Snapchat+ subscribers topped 9 million in Q1, more than tripling year-over-year. From a regional perspective, we observed acceleration in both DR and brand-related advertising revenue growth across all regions in Q1. \n We were particularly pleased to see the improvements we have made to our ad platform translate to improved revenue growth in North America, where revenue grew 16% year-over-year in Q1, an acceleration of 14 percentage points over the prior quarter growth rate. \n Brand-oriented demand in Rest of World and Europe accelerated at a relatively faster pace in Q1 as these regions were more significantly impacted by the war in the Middle East in the prior quarter. We observed the highest rate of acceleration in total advertising revenue growth in Rest of World in Q1, driven in part by strong seasonal demand during the Ramadan holiday, which was further amplified by the timing of the holiday season shifting into Q1 of the current year. \n Total adjusted cost of revenue was $570 million in Q1, up 31% year-over-year. Infrastructure costs were the largest driver of the year-over-year increase driven in large part by the ramp in ML and AI investments to support our DR ad platform and content engagement that we implemented in Q2 and Q3 of the prior year. \n The level of investment in ML and AI was relatively stable across Q4 of 2023 and Q1 of 2024, and we have continued to improve our cloud infrastructure unit costs through a combination of engineering efficiency and pricing improvements. \n In addition, we benefited from higher-than-average service provider credits in Q1 that helped to further reduce infrastructure costs in Q1. As a result, infrastructure cost per DAU declined from $0.84 in Q4 of 2023 to $0.80 in Q1 of 2024. \n The remaining components of adjusted cost of revenue, including content, developer, advertising and other partner costs were $232 million in Q1 or 19% of revenue, compared to 20% in the prior quarter and 21% in the prior year. \n Adjusted gross margin was 52% in Q1 compared to 55% in the prior quarter and 56% in the prior year. The quarter-over-quarter decline in adjusted gross margin is driven entirely by seasonally lower revenue in Q1 compared to Q4, partially offset by the sequential decline in infrastructure costs per DAU. \n The year-over-year decline in adjusted gross margin reflects higher infrastructure investments that began to ramp up in Q2 and Q3 of the prior year, which was partially offset by operating leverage from accelerating revenue growth in Q1. \n Adjusted operating expenses were $579 million in Q1, up 5% year-over-year. Personnel costs increased 4% year-over-year in Q1, driven primarily by the impact of higher personnel costs per regular full-time employee, which was partially offset by reductions in team size as a result of the restructuring initiatives. \n We implemented the restructuring in phases throughout the quarter, resulting in a 3% decline in average headcount year-over-year. We ended Q1 with 4,835 full-time headcount, which was down 7% year-over-year and down 27% from our peak headcount in mid-Q3 of 2022. \n Adjusted EBITDA was $46 million in Q1, up from $1 million in Q1 of the prior year, reflecting both accelerating revenue growth and operating expense discipline. \n Net loss was $305 million in Q1 compared to $329 million in Q1 of the prior year. The improvement in net loss on a year-over-year basis reflects the flow-through of higher adjusted EBITDA, as well as a $60 million reduction in stock-based compensation and related expenses, or SBC, partially offset by transition costs of $70 million related to our restructuring initiatives. \n The impact of past refresh grants on the GAAP accounting of SBC expense has now fully dissipated from the cost structure. This was the largest driver of the year-over-year decline in SBC in Q1 followed by the impact of reduced headcount as a result of the recent restructuring. Dilution or growth in our share count was 3.8% in Q1, down from 5.7% in the prior quarter. \n As part of our efforts to responsibly manage the impact of SBC on our share count, we repurchased 21 million shares at a cost of $235 million in Q1, reflecting an average repurchase price of $11.19. Since we began opportunistically managing our share count through share repurchases in Q3 of 2022, we have repurchased 145 million shares, representing 8% of fully diluted shares outstanding at an average price of $9.86 per share and a total cost of $1.4 billion. Free cash flow was $38 million in Q1, as we continued to strategically prioritize our investments to drive sustained and meaningful positive free cash flow. We ended Q1 with $2.9 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand. \n In addition, in Q1, we repurchased $100 million of our outstanding 2025 convertible notes and $351 million of our outstanding 2026 convertible notes at prices below par value. Through these transactions, we have further reduced the level of debt maturing in the years ahead, while also eliminating the risk of future dilution from the repurchased convertible notes. \n Turning to our outlook. We anticipate continued growth of our global community and our Q2 guidance is built on the assumption that DAU will be approximately $431 million in Q2. Our Q2 guidance range for revenue is $1.225 billion, to $1.255 billion, implying year-over-year revenue growth of 15% to 18%. \n This would represent a 3 to 6 percentage point deceleration in growth rate compared to Q1, which we attribute to the 3 percentage point quarter-over-quarter acceleration in revenue growth experienced in the prior year and a further estimated 3 percentage point headwind due to changes in seasonality factors, including the timing of the Ramadan holiday season shifting toward Q1 in the current year and the impact of the leap day in Q1 of 2021. \n Our investment plans for Q2 include modest incremental investments in infrastructure, personnel and marketing to sustain the momentum we have established in our business, as well as the impact of an increasing legal and regulatory burden on our cost structure. \n Given the revenue range above and our investment plans for the quarter ahead, we estimate that adjusted EBITDA will be between $15 million and $45 million in Q2. \n We have made significant progress to optimize our cost structure and believe it will be productive to provide forward-looking insights into our estimated full year 2024 cost structure. We currently estimate that quarterly infrastructure cost per DAU will be in the $0.83 to $0.85 range for the remainder of 2024. \n We will continue to assess our infrastructure investment levels based on what is in the best long-term interest of our business. We expect the remaining components of cost of revenue, including content and developer partner costs as well as advertising partner and other costs to remain relatively stable as a percentage of revenue at a combined 19% to 21% of revenue, which is within the range we have reported over the trailing 4 quarters. \n We currently anticipate that the headcount and personnel costs will grow modestly as we move through 2024, resulting in full year adjusted operating expenses of approximately $2.425 billion to $2.525 billion. We see limited opportunity to productively reduce adjusted operating expenses below this range. And if we are able to sustain higher rates of revenue growth into the second half of 2024, we will invest prudently to support that growth. For SBC, we anticipate modest sequential growth as we move through 2024, resulting in an estimated full year SBC expense of $1.13 billion to $1.2 billion. \n With that, I'll kick it back to Evan for closing remarks. Doug, it's Derek. Thanks for the question. I think, look, at the first outset, I would say that probably the most important takeaway or theme of the top line results is just how broad-based the acceleration was on the top line. You mentioned DR specifically, but we did see each of brand DR and those 2 pillars across all 3 of our regions accelerate in the quarter. We also saw that the SMB customer base grew quite quickly, active advertisers, they are up 85%. And also then looking over at the Snapchat+ business also subs tripling or more year-over-year to 9 million. So we did see a really broad-based improvement in the top line. \n On the DR side, specifically, I think you've probably seen that we've been making really significant investments in that line of business over the last year, and we made a lot of investments in infrastructure to help improve their number one, leveraging more of our privacy say, signals for ranking and optimization and then continuing to evolve our models to incorporate more of those signals making larger models and refreshing them more frequently. And we've seen really good momentum, in particular on the 7-0 pixel purchase optimization that led to more than 75% increase in purchase-related conversions in Q1. \n And we're making progress on some of the nuts and bolts there around, for example, CAPI adoption we saw a more than 300% increase year-over-year on that. And we now have coverage there of approximately half of the DR revenue. And you made some improvements just in expanding the addressable market there, with the rollout of 7-0 optimization to app install and app purchase with additional app goals coming in Q2 on the road map there. \n So there's a lot of progress on that front. We're seeing that show up in improved rollouts. And I think many of you saw in your channel checks even in Q4 that you were starting to hear about the return on rollouts in the advertising community. And I think you can see that now showing up in the demand in this quarter. \n So if you taken together, I think that each of those are proof points that the DR business is performing much, much better now. And that each of those things are ROAS-based return-based customer success based and that speaks to sort of the durability of that basis. \n So you asked a little bit about the transition of the growth rate into Q2. And we do expect the progress that we've made with the DR business to continue but we do have some unique items just on seasonality. I pointed to a couple in the letter. One in particular, we did have an improvement in the growth rate in the prior year of about 3 percentage points quarter-over-quarter, so that contributes to comps a little. And then there's some unique seasonality factors as we transition from Q1 to Q2 this year, notably, the leap day in Q1 of this year that contributed to the higher growth in Q1 as well as the timing of the Ramadan holiday season, moving more so into Q1 this year relative to Q2 last year and that further contributes to some of the transitions there. But none of those factors really speaking to the fundamentals of the improvement in the business that we're seeing. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of a sense of what we're seeing and the momentum that we've established on that line of the business. Thanks. I think to start, we're growing a newer segment of customers here, and I think that's really exciting to broadening out the overall base of advertisers. So I shared earlier in response to another question that we've seen the active advertiser count on the small and medium-sized customer base up to 85% year-over-year and it being the fastest-growing customer segment. So that is very exciting. \n And I think overall, you're seeing a broadening of the base of advertisers. There's a journey. I think that you're going to see advertisers go through in terms of one coming on to the platform, initial testing, seeing performance with some of these scaled self-serve products and then being able to grow and optimize. And of course, as we continue to bring more privacy safe signals into our models and invest in bigger models and get better and better at optimization and ranking, those products become more performant. They deliver better ROAS to those customers and they give them the ability to bid and expand their budget. \n So I do think there's a journey here. I think what's really exciting is to see the ad platform delivering the kind of results that can help us grow that customer base. Because over the long term, the small and medium-sized customer base is going to be an absolutely critical ingredient to reaching the full monetization potential of the business. So off to a good start and a lot of work to do to continue helping more of these advertisers through that journey. Hopefully, that context helps. I can start around the scale and scope of the infrastructure investments, and you're going to see those show up in really a couple of places. Number one, we shared last year that we scaled up our ML and AI infrastructure spending into the range of about $100 million a quarter starting in Q2 and Q3 of last year. And then we shared that, that investment -- larger investments were relatively stable over the last 2 quarters. Obviously, with the full year range on infrastructure for Dow, stepping up from $0.80 in Q1 to $0.83 to $0.85 in the remaining quarters of the year. We've given ourselves room to invest more there. \n I think the important -- there's a couple of important things I would say, just to put our investment in perspective. One is that we're investing on a different model. Rather than CapEx, it's showing up as a cloud infrastructure cost that's running through cost of revenue. But two, there's a multiplier on that spend as an ongoing operating expense relative to the underlying CapEx it represents. \n So while we might be spending hundreds of millions a year currently on this type of infrastructure, the underlying capital is multiples of that. So the scale of the infrastructure that we have access to, to run our models is obviously much, much larger. And so that's giving the business access to a lot of capacity. \n And I think second and perhaps really over the long term, the most important thing is whether or not we're seeing the returns on that investment that are going to allow us to continue to scale that investment profitably for the business. And I think what you're seeing in the results in Q1 here are proof points that those investments that we've made in that infrastructure are paying off in significant and accelerating revenue growth and in particular, on the DR ad platform in addition to how it's contributing on the engagement side. And that's going to position the business to be able to continue to scale those investments ideally continue to see positive ROI on that like we have seen and grow our business over time. \n So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of perspective of how we're thinking. We're going to continue to reassess that. We've been really pleased with the ROI on those investments to date, and we've made room to scale them, and we'll continue to do that based on the data that we're getting back. \n On your second question related to CAPI integrations, we're really pleased with the momentum on the coverage that we've seen there. I'd mentioned that we're looking at about 50% demand-weighted coverage of our DR ad revenue and those integrations are up about 3x, 300% year-over-year. So obviously, good momentum in getting that adopted across our DR advertising customer base. \n And so really important, I think, to insulating the business going forward and helping our customers to have measurable results. And as I said in the answer to the prior question, the recipe here is getting people on board, getting them to adopt the right advertising solution for the objectives they're trying to achieve. \n And a good proof point on that is we are providing targeted offers to small- and medium-sized customers based on what we know about their business to recommend the right advertising product for them and advertisers that adopt those recommendations are seeing much improved results, and that's contributing in a scaled, self-served way, to people being able to meet their ROAS objectives, grow their business, which puts them in a position to invest more on our platform. \n So I think that's the recipe there in terms of us seeing that advertiser base scale. And we shared that 85% growth in the active advertisers in the segment to let you know that in addition to people making progress on these integrations, it's turning into a flywheel on the actual customer base. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit more context of what we see as the path there and how that's going. In terms of color on the verticals and where we're seeing the operating environment generally as we went through Q1, number one, I think we've seen the improvement in the operating environment to be fairly broad into Q1 and that we did see certain regions particularly impacted by the war in the Middle East in Q4. \n And so that certainly we've seen demand, as we mentioned in the letter, really improve on that front quarter-over-quarter. But I think more broadly, we saw a much more robust brand environment, which played out in all of our regions in Q1. And then from a DR perspective, it's really about fit. And of course, with purchase optimization and the scale that self-serve SMB product is working really well. \n We've seen verticals such as CPG e-commerce restaurants and travel and SMBs broadly working really well. And I think what we're excited about is to be able to broaden that out to a wider set of customers as we introduce more of these out-based optimizations and start to address other verticals. So a much better environment in Q1 for sure. Thank you for the question. Dan, on the question about SMB, I would agree. I mean, that growth on the active advertisers is obviously a really important input to building what we hope will be a very big business for us over time. And we're early in the going. So there's a lot of opportunity set here both in terms of product market fit as we are able to have more optimizations that are going to appeal to a wider and wider audience in that SMB set. \n And I think we're learning a lot about how to use integration partners to help make it easier for these advertisers to onboard over time as well as the ability to work our funnels, whether that's from awareness to onboarding an acquisition to trial and discovery and through the scaling process of delivering ROAS for these partners. \n So we're early in the going there, but excited about the progress we're seeing so far, and it's something that we'll hope to build on as we go forward. So thanks for the questions. And hopefully, that gives you a little more perspective of how we're thinking about it."

            "name": "Evan Spiegel",
            "content": "Hi, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. I'm excited to share the progress we are making on our strategic priorities and the momentum we are building to capitalize on the long-term potential of our business. I'm deeply inspired by the dedication and efforts so many of our team members have put into serving our community and our partners, and it is gratifying to see our efforts beginning to bear fruit. \n On our call today, I'll open with some observations about our strategic direction and key developments and then you'll hear from Derek. The full financial detail is in our investor letter, but going forward, we'll also be giving more context on the earnings call. \n We remain committed to executing against our 3 strategic priorities: accelerating and diversifying our revenue growth, growing our community and deepening their engagement and leading in augmented reality. The most important strategic priority we set out for 2024 is accelerating and diversifying revenue growth. We have made significant progress to start the year with revenue growing 21% year-over-year, an acceleration of 16 percentage points over the prior quarter growth rate, which was driven by improvements we have made to our advertising platform and an increase in demand for our advertising solutions while also benefiting from the impact of an improved operating environment. \n Our large hard-to-reach audience, brand-safe environment and continued innovation and progress on our advertising platform have made us a valuable partner for businesses that want to reach the next generation. \n Our second strategic priority, designing innovative products and services that enhance people's relationships with their friends, family and the world continues to drive the growth of our global community. \n In Q1, we reached 422 million daily active users, an increase of 39 million or 10% year-over-year. We continue to broaden and deepen engagement with our content platform with the number of viewers and total time spent watching content growing globally year-over-year. Our focus on visual communication between friends and family is a strategic advantage that has enabled us to reach more than 75% of 13 to 34 year olds in over 25 countries with these countries representing more than 50% of the global advertising market. \n Relationships are what drive the depth of engagement on our platform. Our goal is to ensure that Snapchat helps enhance relationships with the people who matter most. These relationships lead to increased daily active usage of our platform and happier members of our community. 4 out of 5 Snapchatters believe that connecting with friends is the simplest way to feel better. This year, we are particularly focused on helping lightly engaged new and resurrected Snapchatters build relationships on our platform. Building just 1 or 2 close relationships on Snapchat and dramatically increase the number of active days for these cohorts while simultaneously leading to a happier and healthier community. Over 90% of Snapchatters say they feel comfortable, happy and connected when they use Snapchat. And Snapchat is ranked as the #1 happiest platform when compared to other apps. \n We've been working hard to improve our advertising platform by helping our partners transition to new ways of measuring and optimizing their advertising spend in order to provide improved ROAS. In Q1, ongoing momentum with our 7-0 pixel purchase optimization model led to a more than 75% increase in purchase-related conversions year-over-year. \n In addition, we are excited by the progress we're seeing with our small- and medium-sized advertising partners. Today, small- and medium-sized businesses and creators can promote their services, content or products and reach new audiences, all with just a few taps within the Snap chat application. This has been instrumental in significantly accelerating the number of SMB advertisers on Snapchat, which increased 85% year-over-year. \n As we look forward, the deliberate actions we've taken with our cost structure have cleared a path to meaningful adjusted EBITDA profitability and positive free cash flow. We have invested heavily in cloud infrastructure over the past year in order to improve the performance of our advertising products and deepen engagement on our platform. \n We will continue to calibrate our investments carefully moving forward to ensure we build on this momentum while also realizing the operating leverage necessary to drive improved financial performance. \n We believe that a strong financial foundation and track record of innovation are critical inputs in fulfilling our vision of computing overlaid on the world. This is our third strategic priority. We have never worked on anything as profound and meaningful as augmented reality. AR enables us to service digital experiences seamlessly in the world around us, transforming the way we use computing in our daily lives. \n Our AR products and services are driving major impact at scale today. On average, over 300 million people engage with augmented reality every single day on Snapchat. Our community plays with AR Lenses billions of times per day on average, and our AR creator community has built millions of lenses using our Lens Studio software. \n Having a large, engaged AR audience and creator community enables us to innovate rapidly. This unique position has allowed us to develop a lead and augmented reality over the last decade by leveraging one of the world's most used cameras developing highly advanced technology and tools and growing a vibrant AR creator ecosystem. \n We believe that our large and growing community, an innovative and engaging service that continues to evolve and a strong balance sheet with positive free cash flow positions us well to achieve our long-term vision for augmented reality, which we believe will be one of the most meaningful advancements in computing that the world has ever seen. \n With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Derek to speak about our financials. Thanks, Derek. As we continue to execute in the quarters ahead, we remain focused on serving our community with innovative and responsible products, investing in our direct response business to deliver measurable ROAS for our advertising partners, cultivating new sources of revenue to diversify our top line growth and scaling our investment levels prudently to deliver meaningful and sustained profitability and positive free cash flow. The most critical input to delivering on these strategic initiatives we laid out is innovation. That includes innovating on our products, our advertising platform and the future of augmented reality. \n We believe that our demonstrated track record of innovation over the last 12 years positions us well to deliver on this for our community, our partners and our investors. While there is still a lot of work to be done, we are pleased that this focus has translated into improved results in Q1. \n We will now begin our Q&A session. Thanks, Ken. Yes, we certainly have been shifting more of our resourcing and focus to growth in North America and Europe. It's a different opportunity set. Historically, we were more focused on new users and developing markets who are typically on Android devices. This is really about focusing more on reengagement with users who have downloaded Snapchat before and who may not be using it as often as some of their friends and those users are typically on iOS. \n So I'd say the opportunity set overall is different. And in our early explorations, we're finding a lot of opportunity to improve that product experience. \n So the near-term and month-over-month trends have been pretty constructive growth from February to March and March to April month to date in North America has been positive. So we're making progress here. It is early, but we are seeing a lot of opportunity and eager to improve the product for our community in North America and Europe. . Thanks, Rich. Yes, as we look at Spotlight and Creator stories, they've definitely been bright spots in terms of time spent. As you mentioned, we are really working to simplify and unify the experience, both in terms of the user perspective. So one unified feed of content, but also the ranking stack, which is going to enable us to really share signal engagement signals between stories and Spotlight, which we just haven't done historically. So we think that will really help personalize the experience overall. \n I'd say looking at the feedback from our community, one area where we can really improve is in making the content feel more timely and topical. We have a lot of great signals from our community about things that are trending, things that they're interested in, in a given moment. But we haven't done a very good job surfacing the corresponding content that we also have as well because people are making billions of snaps every day on Snapchat. \n So I think there's work to be done to make our content experience feel more timely and topical, and then we're spending a lot of focus on the creator journey overall. That journey from using Snapchat to communicate with 100 friends to growing a following of millions. And really making sure that people are creating great stories or great Spotlight content can be discovered and then grow that following and ultimately build a business over time. So that's been a big focus as well. Certainly, a big opportunity for us, and we're working away at it. Yes. Thanks so much for the question. On the app side, the biggest thing we've been working on lately is just landing these model updates. We, I guess, in the last week or so, have updated our app install models, both for scan and non-scan. So that's been great. And we now have our app install 7-0 and app purchase 7-0 products in testing. It's very early, but the results have been promising so far. \n We also have a new scan offering that we're just introducing to our customers. So we'll be excited to get their feedback and see how that can improve their performance, and we have a number of customers testing that already. \n I think value optimization will follow. We've really just been focused on driving more click-through installs at much lower CPIs for our advertising partners. And then we'll be working more on the value optimization piece. I think just broadly looking at the advertising platform, we have made a lot of progress, as Derek mentioned, on signals and running much larger unified models, of course, the ad interactions as well in the ad formats. \n I think sort of looking ahead, we've been working on things like product selection for our dynamic product ads product. We've been making progress with things like cold start, which is especially relevant for SMB advertisers at lower levels of spend to help them find success. So I think there's a lot more work to do, but we're building on a solid foundation now, and we've been able to make some very rapid progress. Thanks so much for the question. Yes, as we look at content on Snapchat, I think the most successful content is really about relationships. And those can be relationships with your close friends and family, but it could also be relationships with Snap Stars. And that's the feedback we hear from Snap Stars as well that the engagement they have and the relationship they're able to build with their audience on Snapchat is really unparalleled. And one of the reasons why they love investing in our platform. \n As we look at scaling the Snap Star program, I'd say today, the focus is mostly around looking at countries, geographies where we're sort of under-indexed in investing in Snap Stars there so we can build out more local language content. \n We're also looking at interest. A lot of Snap Stars create content around their interests. That could be food or travel, sports, those sorts of things. And so we're really looking at this intersection of the geographies where we have Snap Stars and on the interest as well and really lining up with that up with our community and what they're looking for. \n So yes, I would say overall, to your point, relationships really do drive that content consumption on our service, and that's why Snap Stars are such an important part of our offering. Yes, we can. Yes, as we look at Amazon partnership and what they're doing with Handshake, I do think that's a great learning opportunity for us. It's still very early, but I think what's exciting is being able to bring relevant products to Amazon shoppers inside the Snapchat experience. We know that people now shop where they consume content and so to be able to offer a relevant product selection in line and allow people to check out with one tap is certainly an exciting product development. So we'll obviously continue to learn there and evolve that product. \n I do think just separately that some of these ad partnerships we've done and work we've done with other demand partners have been important elements of our growth, and we do see continued opportunity there."
