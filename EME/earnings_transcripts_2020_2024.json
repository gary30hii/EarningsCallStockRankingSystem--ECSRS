Let me start the call this morning by congratulating Maxine on her promotion and also welcoming Ron Johnson as our newest EMCOR Director. Maxine, congratulations, and Ron, welcome to EMCOR's Board. I'm going to be covering Pages 4 through 8 here in my opening comments. First, I'd like to welcome all of you, and thank you for your interest and/or investment in EMCOR. In 2020, we had a terrific year despite an extremely challenging operating environment. We delivered extraordinary results through disciplined execution and resilience. I am extremely proud of our EMCOR team. I don't think any of us could have imagined this high level of performance when we started to understand the impact of COVID-19 on our operations in March of 2020. In 2020, we had $8.8 billion in revenues and set records on an adjusted basis for earnings per diluted share of $6.40, operating income of $490 million and operating income margin of 5.6%. We also had record operating cash flow of $806 million. Mark's going to cover all the financials in much more detail and especially the key components of our cash flow performance in his financial commentary, inclusive of the fourth quarter and full year 2020 performance. We delivered these stellar results because we have diversity and demand for our services. And we have end markets that have proved resilient and have provided us with opportunities to execute well for our customers. These results are a testament to our skilled employees and our subsidiary, segment and corporate leadership, who kept focused and resolute through the ever-changing environment in 2020. Across our company, we worked hard to keep our employees safe, and it was our #1 priority throughout the year. We innovated and found ways to maintain and even improve our productivity. We became leaner and even more expeditious in our decision-making. And we're able to leverage technology to connect our leadership effectively to the front lines despite COVID-19 protocols. We did not let obstacles become excuses. Instead, we overcame obstacles, and we delivered exceptional results.  I now want to highlight some of our segment performance. Our Electrical Construction segment performed well with 8.4% operating income margins. Despite the disruptions in some of our operations from COVID-19 and due to shutdowns, we still posted outstanding results. These results were driven by excellent execution in the commercial sector driven by data center and telecommunication and really excellent execution across all market sectors. We've performed the work well and really innovated on the means, the methods and the scheduling so that we can not only keep our employees safe, but enhance our productivity.  Our Mechanical Construction segment had an exceptional year by any measure. We also had 8.4% operating income margins with exceptional performance across the commercial sector, again driven by telecommunications and data centers. And we also had strength in warehousing, manufacturing, water and wastewater and the health care end markets. We showed great innovation through increased use of BIM or building information modeling and prefabrication and worked hard to keep our employees safe and productive. We believe in both of our construction segments that we not only met, but we exceeded our customers' expectations.  Our United States Building Services segment team showed grit and resilience as they faced the COVID-19 disruption in late March, April and May, with many of our customer sites not acceptable, bookings off as much as 40% in some of our subsidiary companies and in some of our product lines and a very cautious resumption of decision-making by our customers to allow us to resume service and projects. We did rebound robustly from mid-June forward, and we're well prepared to execute project work for our customers that optimize their equipment and control systems, improve the wellness of their facilities through indoor air quality or IAQ solutions and sought to help our customers return to work safely and productively.  We also served as the boots on the ground for our customers to keep lightly occupied buildings, campuses and schools operational, functioning and safe over the past 10 months. We are well positioned to keep serving our customers as they reopen and seek to make their building safe, efficient and productive for their employees. Our U.K. Building Services segment mirrored the performance of our U.S. Building Services segment. We navigated the severe lockdown actions in the U.K. and continued to keep our customers productive, operational and able to conduct their businesses. We also made organizational changes that enhanced our leaders' responsiveness by making our organization even flatter, more aligned and leaner, which has led to crisper and more efficient decision-making.  Our U.K. team continues to win in the market as we have a culture of innovation and execution. As you all know, our Industrial Services segment mostly serves the downstream oil and gas or refining and petrochemical markets. These end markets had a severe dislocation of demand as planes stop flying and people stop driving. And this segment was also impacted at the beginning of the year with a disruption in the global oil and gas markets. We cut costs aggressively and maintain profitability on an EBITDA basis. We are well positioned with demand for our services returns, which is not likely to happen until the fourth quarter of this year. We expect the larger, more sophisticated, well-capitalized service providers to emerge stronger. And yes, we are clearly one of them. We exit 2020 with our remaining performance obligations or RPOs at an all-time high of $4.6 billion, 13.8% higher than the year-ago period. We have very strong RPOs and are continuing to benefit from the very strong demand for data center construction, logistics and supply chain support, especially with our fire protection trade, health care, water and wastewater. And we expect manufacturing to be as strong also as 2021 progresses. We expect to benefit from increasing demand for IAQ, that's indoor air quality, and building efficiency projects and solutions. We depart 2020 with an exceptional balance sheet that allows us the room to grow and build for the future while continuing to return cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  2020 was an extraordinary year, and we performed exceptionally well, which is a real testament to our people, our subsidiary leaders, our segment staff and leadership and our corporate staff and leadership. And really, I'd just like to thank all of them.  I will now turn the discussion over to Mark. \nMark Pompa: Thank you, Tony, and good morning to everyone participating on the call today. For those accessing this presentation via the webcast, we are now on Slide 7. Over the next several slides, I will provide a detailed discussion of our fourth quarter results before moving to our full year performance, some of which Tony outlined during his opening commentary. As a reminder, all financial information discussed during this morning's call is included in our consolidated financial statements within both our earnings release announcement and Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier today.  So let's discuss EMCOR's fourth quarter performance. Consolidated revenues of $2.3 billion in quarter 4 are down $122.4 million or 5.1% from 2019. Our fourth quarter results include $55.4 million of revenues attributable to businesses acquired pertaining to the period of time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in last year's fourth quarter. Acquisition revenues positively impacted both our United States Mechanical Construction and United States Building Services segments. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired, fourth quarter 2020 consolidated revenues decreased $177.9 million or 7.4% organically. Our segment performance was mixed within the quarter, with most of our reportable segments experiencing quarter-over-quarter organic revenue declines. In general, we have seen reductions in revenues in those geographies or market sectors which are continuing to be most significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, when we consider the incremental revenue generated from our acquisitions, we were successful in generating fourth quarter revenue growth from 3 of our 5 reportable segments. Specific segment revenue performance for the quarter is as follows: United States Electrical Construction segment revenues of $493.5 million decreased $71 million or 12.6% from quarter 4 2019. Revenues declined across multiple market sectors due to the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the associated containment and mitigation measures as well as the curtailment of capital spending by some of our customers. Consistent with my third quarter commentary, this segment experienced a significant reduction in revenues from industrial project work within the manufacturing market sector, where certain of our electrical businesses perform services for both midstream and upstream oil and gas customers. Additionally, the segment's operations that serve the metropolitan New York and California markets continue to face revenue headwinds as these geographies remain some of the most restrictive with regards to COVID protocols. United States Mechanical Construction segment revenues of $969.4 million increased $73.8 million or 8.2% from quarter 4 2019. Excluding acquisition revenues of $24.2 million, the segment's revenues increased $49.6 million or 5.5% organically. Revenue growth within the quarter was broad based across most market sectors, with commercial and health care representing the most significant period-over-period increases. These revenue gains were partially offset by a quarterly revenue decline in manufacturing market sector activity due to the completion or substantial completion of certain large projects during the early part of 2020. This revenue performance represents an all-time quarterly record for our United States Mechanical Construction segment and surpasses the previous record set in 2019's fourth quarter. EMCOR's total domestic construction business fourth quarter revenues of $1.46 billion increased $2.7 million or less than 0.25%. United States Building Services revenues of $568.1 million increased $29.1 million or 5.4%. However, when excluding acquisition revenues of $31.2 million, this segment's quarterly revenues decreased $2.1 million or 40 basis points. Revenue gains within their mobile mechanical services division resulting from incremental contribution from acquired companies and their commercial site-based services division due to new contract awards or scope expansion on certain existing contracts were partially offset by a quarter-over-quarter revenue decline within the segment's energy services division due to reduced large project activity when compared to 2019's fourth quarter. Consistent with our United States Mechanical Construction Services segment, revenue performance within our United States Building Services segment represents an all-time quarterly record. United States Industrial Services revenues of $135.5 million decreased by $163.7 million or 54.7% as this segment continues to be impacted by the negative macroeconomic conditions and uncertainty within the markets in which it operates. Cost control and cash preservation actions taken by customers of this segment have resulted in the suspension of capital spending programs and the curtailment of maintenance activity, which has severely impacted demand for our Industrial Service offerings. With the rise in telecommuting and the various restrictions on travel in response to COVID-19, there have been significant reductions in both vehicle miles driven and airline miles traveled, which is further prolonging the weakened demand this segment has been experiencing since late quarter 1 of 2020. United Kingdom Building Services segment revenues of $115 million increased $9.4 million or 8.9% from last year's quarter. Revenue gains for the quarter resulted from strong project activity as well as incremental revenue from new contract awards. Additionally, fourth quarter 2020 revenues were positively impacted by $2.9 million as a result of favorable foreign exchange rate movement in the period.  Please turn to Slide 8. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $244.6 million reflects an increase of $3.7 million from quarter four 2019. The current period includes approximately $4.4 million of incremental expenses from businesses acquired, inclusive of intangible asset amortization, resulting in an organic quarter-over-quarter decrease of approximately $700,000. A reduction in salaries expense due to a decrease in head count necessitated by lower organic revenue as well as reduced travel and entertainment expenses due to a combination of cost-avoidance measures as well as restricted company travel were the primary reasons for the organic decline in SG&A.  These decreases were largely offset by an increase in quarterly incentive compensation expense due to EMCOR's actual operating performance exceeding its previously forecasted 2020 full year results. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses totaled 10.7% in quarter four 2020 versus 10% in the year-ago period. The quarter-over-quarter increase can be attributed to the reduction in our consolidated quarterly revenues without a commensurate decrease in certain of our fixed overhead costs, including those of our Industrial Services segment as we do not deem the current operating environment to be permanent.  Our assessment continues to be based on our evaluation of future market opportunities. And we expect to see some return to normalcy in industrial maintenance and capital spending when we ultimately move beyond the depressed demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Reported operating income for the quarter of $137.6 million represents a $14.7 million or 12% increase when compared to operating income of $122.9 million in last year's fourth quarter. This operating income performance eclipses our previously established all-time quarterly record, which was achieved in 2020's third quarter.  Our fourth quarter operating margin was 6%, which compares favorably to the 5.1% of operating margin reported in 2019's fourth quarter. We experienced the operating margin expansion within each of our reportable segments other than our U.S. Industrial Services segment, which is reporting an operating loss for the fourth quarter and our UK Building Services segment, which achieved a consistent margin in each year's quarterly period. Specific quarterly performance by reportable segment is as follows: our United States Electrical Construction segment had operating income of $43.4 million, which increased by $2.1 million from the comparable 2019 period. Reported quarterly operating margin is 8.8% and represents a 150 basis point improvement over 2019's fourth quarter.  This increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin is largely attributable to increased gross profit contribution from commercial market sector activities, inclusive of numerous telecommunications construction projects. These gross profit gains were partially offset by reduced gross profit contribution from the transportation and manufacturing market sectors due to both the closeout of projects in prior periods as well as the continued headwinds attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Fourth quarter operating income of the United States Mechanical Construction Services segment of $100.4 million represents a $31.5 million increase from last year's quarter, while operating margin in the quarter of 10.4% represents a 270 basis point improvement over 2019. This segment has continued to experience strength in the majority of the market sectors we serve, most notably demonstrated by increased gross profit contribution from project activity in the commercial, health care and institutional market sectors.  In addition, our Mechanical Construction segment experienced a more favorable mix of work than in the prior year and benefited from strong performance by our fire protection operations. Our combined U.S. construction business is reporting a 9.8% operating margin and $143.7 million of operating income, which has increased from 2019's fourth quarter by $33.5 million or 30.4%. Operating income for United States Building Services of $28 million represents a $3.8 million increase from last year's fourth quarter, and operating margin of 4.9% represents an improvement of 40 basis points when compared to the prior year. This segment experienced improved gross profit performance from its mobile mechanical services division, inclusive of incremental contribution from acquired companies. In addition, the segment continues to benefit from reduced levels of selling, general and administrative expenses due to cost-mitigation actions implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our United States Industrial Services segment operating loss of $8.2 million represents a decline of $21.3 million, which compares to operating income of $13.1 million in last year's fourth quarter. As mentioned earlier on today's call as well as during my commentary on each of our last 2 quarterly conference calls, our Industrial Services segment has been significantly impacted by the adverse macroeconomic conditions within the oil and gas industry, including the dramatic decline in demand for refined oil products resulting from travel restrictions and other containment and mitigation measures imposed in response to COVID-19. These conditions have resulted in considerable reductions in capital spending by certain of our customers, which has led to a decrease in demand for this segment's service offerings. This environment was further exacerbated by an active hurricane season, which resulted in the suspension of planned maintenance activities that would have occurred during both quarters 3 and 4 of 2020.  Tony will speak to our 2021 expectations overall as well as our expectations for this segment later in this morning's call. United Kingdom Building Services operating income of $4.2 million represents an increase of approximately $300,000 over quarter 4 of 2019. Operating margin was 3.7% for both quarter periods. We are now on Slide 9. Additional financial items of significance for the quarter not previously addressed are as follows: quarter 4 gross profit of $383.9 million or 16.8% of revenues is improved over last year's quarter by $19.1 million and 160 basis points of gross margin. Restructuring expenses in 2020's fourth quarter pertain to the realignment of management resources within our combined U.S. construction operations. Diluted earnings per common share of $1.45 compares to $1.54 per diluted share in last year's fourth quarter. Adjusting our 2020 quarterly performance for the negative impact on our income tax rate resulting from the nondeductible portion of the noncash impairment charges recording -- recorded during the second quarter of 2020, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2020, is $1.86, which favorably compares to last year's fourth quarter by $0.32 or nearly 21%. Our tax rate for quarter 4 of 2020 is 41.8%, which is significantly higher than the tax rate for the corresponding 2019 period due to the nondeductibility of the majority of the impairment charges just referenced. My last comment on Slide 9 is with respect to our $259.5 million of operating cash flow in the quarter, which favorably compares to $178.8 million of operating cash flow in the year-ago period and reflects the continued effective management of working capital by our subsidiary leadership teams. Our operating cash flow was aided by the organic decline in revenues, which resulted in a contraction in accounts receivable. Additionally, the deferral of the employer's portion of social security taxes in the United States benefited our cash flow by approximately $35.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2020. On a full year basis, the social security tax deferrals, coupled with the deferral of value-added tax in the United Kingdom, has favorably impacted our 12-month operating cash flow by approximately $117.3 million. These amounts will be repaid in 2021 and 2022. And obviously, we'll have the opposite effect on our operating cash flow in such future periods. Please turn to Slide 10. With the fourth quarter commentary complete, I will now augment Tony's introductory remarks on EMCOR's annual performance.  Consolidated revenues of $8.8 billion represent a decrease of $377.6 million or 4.1% when compared to our record annual revenues in 2019 of $9.17 billion. Our year-to-date results include $269.6 million of revenues attributable to businesses acquired pertaining to the period of time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in the 2019 period. Acquisitions positively impacted each of our United States Electrical Construction, United States Mechanical Construction and the United States Building Services segments. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired, year-to-date revenues decreased organically 7.1%, primarily as a result of the significant revenue contraction experienced during quarter 2 as the majority of our operations were most significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during such period. In addition, our annual revenues were negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for certain of our service offerings within our United States Electrical Construction services and United States Industrial Services segments as a result of the adverse conditions experienced within the oil and gas industry.  Discrete segment revenue performance for full year 2020 is as follows: United States Electrical Construction segment revenues of $1.97 billion decreased $243.2 million or 11% from 2019's $2.22 billion of revenues; acquisitions contributed $25.4 million of incremental revenues, resulting in an organic decline of $268.5 million or 12.1%. Revenue contraction within the majority of the market sectors in which we operate. Most notably, the commercial and manufacturing market sectors were the primary drivers of this year's year-over-year decrease. As I mentioned in my commentary on our fourth quarter results, although this segment has a diverse geographic footprint, a number of its operating companies within both the metropolitan New York and California markets were severely impacted by COVID protocols, which resulted in a decrease in the number of short-duration project opportunities as well as various project delays. These impacts, coupled with the completion or substantial completion of certain large projects in 2019, contributed to the decline in organic annual revenues.  In addition, and as previously referenced, certain of our operations in the segment which are exposed to the upstream and midstream oil and gas sector experienced a significant decline in demand in 2020. Partially offsetting these revenue reductions were increased revenues from project activities within the institutional and hospitality market sectors during the year. United States Mechanical Construction revenues of $3.49 billion increased $145.2 million or 4.3% compared to 2019. Acquisitions contributed $188.8 million of incremental revenues to the segment, which, when excluded, results in an organic revenue decline of $43.7 million or 1.3% from 2020. This organic decrease can be largely attributed to reduced project volume within the manufacturing market sector with a heavy concentration in the food processing submarket sector as a result of the completion or substantial completion of certain large projects in 2019. Similar to our United States Electrical Construction segment, this segment additionally experienced the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a reduced number of short-duration project opportunities during calendar 2020. United States Building Services segment revenues of $2.11 billion increased $3.2 million or less than 0.5%. Acquisitions contributed $55.4 million of revenues, resulting in an organic revenue decline of 2.5% when compared to full year 2019. The decrease in project and building controls activities within the segment's mobile mechanical services division, largely as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in the temporary closure of certain customers' facilities, coupled with the decrease in large project activity within the segment's energy services division were the primary contributors to such organic revenue reduction.  In addition, the segment experienced a decrease in revenues from its government services division as a result of the loss of certain contracts not renewed pursuant to rebid. These revenue contractions were partially offset by increased customer demand for certain services aimed at improving the indoor air quality within their facilities as well as an increase in revenues within the segment's commercial site-based services division as a result of new contract awards and scope expansion on certain existing contracts. United States Industrial Services segment revenues of $797.5 million decreased $290.1 million or 26.7% from 2019's $1.09 billion of revenues. At the risk of sounding repetitive, for most of 2020, the segment has been severely impacted by negative conditions and uncertainty within the markets in which it operates due to the dislocation between crude oil supply and demand resulting from COVID-19 and geopolitical tensions within OPEC. In addition, during the back half of 2020, the segment experienced suspension and deferral maintenance in capital projects by its customers as a result of hurricane and tropical storm activity in the United States Gulf Coast region. Revenues of our United Kingdom Building Services segment for 2020 increased 1.7% to $430.6 million, primarily as a result of new maintenance contract awards within the commercial and institutional market sectors. Revenues were also favorably impacted by $2.3 million as a result of exchange rate movement in the pound sterling year-over-year.  Please turn to Slide 11. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $903.6 million represent 10.3% of revenues as compared to $893.5 million or 9.7% of revenues in 2019. Full year 2020 SG&A includes $29.6 million of incremental expenses, inclusive of intangible asset amortization pertaining to businesses acquired. Excluding such incremental amounts, our SG&A has decreased $19.4 million on an organic basis, primarily as a result of certain cost reductions resulting from our actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As referenced during my quarter commentary, the increase in SG&A as a percentage of revenues is a result of the organic decrease in our revenue without a commensurate decrease in certain of our fixed overhead costs as we do not deem the current operating environment to be permanent. 2020's year-to-date operating income is $256.8 million. Adjusting this amount to exclude the noncash impairment loss on goodwill, identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets recorded in the second quarter, our non-GAAP operating income for the year was $489.6 million. This compares to operating income of $460.9 million for full year 2019 and represents a $28.7 million or 6.2% improvement year-over-year.  Despite the headwinds experienced in 2020, 3 of our 5 reportable segments achieved higher operating income and higher operating margins than that of the prior year. Of the 2 segments which did not, United States Building Services is reporting a modest decline of just over 1%, while our United States Industrial Services segment suffered a significant year-over-year reduction, resulting in an operating loss for 2020. With regard to each segment's discrete performance, I will start with our electrical, United States Electrical Construction segment. Their 2020 operating income of $166.5 million represents an all-time segment record, and it is an increase of $4.8 million or 3% compared to the prior year. Operating margin for 2020 is 8.4%, which is 110 basis points higher than 2019. This year-over-year improvement in operating income dollars was due to a reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses due to cost-control measures enacted during the course of 2020. The increase in operating margin for the year was a result of an increase in gross profit margin given favorable project execution and a more profitable mix of work within this segment. These improvements in gross profit margin were partially offset by an increase in the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to revenues as a result of the year-over-year revenue contraction within the Electrical Construction segment. United States Mechanical Construction operating income of $292.5 million increased $67.5 million or 30% over 2019 levels, and operating margin reached 8.4% versus 6.7% in the prior year. Acquired companies contributed incremental operating income of $9.3 million, inclusive of $12.7 million of amortization expense associated with identifiable intangible assets. The increase in operating income for 2020 was primarily due to strong project performance throughout the year in the majority of the market sector served by this segment, resulting in an increase in annual gross profit. The 170 basis point improvement in operating margin was also a result of our solid project execution and improved gross profit margin, most notably within the manufacturing and commercial market sectors. These increases in gross profit and gross profit margin were partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily as a result of an increase in incentive compensation expense due to the improved year-over-year operating performance for this segment. United States Building Services operating income for 2020 of $113.4 million declined by $1.3 million or 1.2% due to a reduction in year-over-year large project activity within the segment's energy services division as well as decreased project and building control opportunities within their mechanical services division due to both temporary closure and restricted access to certain customer facilities impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. These reductions were partially offset by incremental operating income contribution from companies acquired, which totaled $4.5 million, inclusive of $3.2 million of amortization expense associated with identifiable intangible assets. In addition, this segment experienced increased gross profit resulting from greater demand for certain services aimed at improving indoor air quality as various customers made changes to their HVAC systems in advance of their employees returning to work as recommended by the Center for Disease Control. Operating margin of 5.4% was consistent with the prior year as a reduction in gross profit margin was offset by a decrease in the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to revenues due to certain cost-reduction measures taken during 2020. Our United States Industrial Services segment incurred an operating loss of $2.8 million for 2020 as compared to operating income of $44.3 million in 2019. As referenced numerous times during this morning's call, this segment was the most severely impacted by the pandemic as well as the other macroeconomic factors affecting the oil and gas industry. This segment implemented significant cost reductions during the year in an effort to mute the year-over-year decline. However, as previously discussed, this segment's overhead structure includes a significant investment in fixed infrastructure, including plant and equipment. As we view current market conditions to be -- as to be temporary, that infrastructure is needed to respond to changes in demand patterns once they ultimately recover.  Operating income of our United Kingdom Building Services segment of $20.7 million or 4.8% of revenues compares to operating income of $18.3 million or 4.3% of revenues in the prior year. The $2.3 million improvement is largely due to an increase in gross profit from new maintenance contract awards, while the 50 basis point expansion in operating margin is attributable to both the increase in gross profit margin as well as a reduction in the ratio of selling and general and administrative expenses to revenues.  SG&A of this segment benefited from various cost-control initiatives implemented by our UK team. We are now on Slide 12. Additional key financial data on Slide 12 not addressed during my full year commentary is as follows: year-to-date gross profit of $1.4 billion is greater than 2019's gross profit by $39.5 million, while gross margin of 15.9% is higher than last year's 14.8% by 110 basis points. Total restructuring costs of $2.2 million are increased from 2019 due to actions taken during 2020 to both realign certain management functions as well as right size our cost structure in light of the revenue headwinds we faced.  Diluted earnings per common share was $2.40 compared to $5.75 per diluted share a year ago. When adjusting this amount for the impact of the noncash impairment charges recorded in 2020 second quarter, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $6.40 as compared to the same $5.75 in last year's annual period. This represents a $0.65 or 11.3% improvement year-over-year.  We are now on Slide 13. As outlined on this slide, EMCOR's liquidity profile remains strong despite the headwinds we faced during the course of 2020. Our cash balance has increased from $358.8 million at December 31, 2019, to $902.9 million at the end of 2020. Operating cash flow of $806.4 million, aided by the FICA and VAT cash tax deferrals previously referenced, was the primary driver of this increase.  Operating cash flow was partially offset by cash used in investing activities of nearly $95 million, predominantly representing payments for acquisitions of businesses and capital expenditures as well as cash used in financing activities, which totaled $172 million and consisted of the repurchase of our common stock, net repayments under our credit facility and dividends paid to our stockholders. Working capital has increased by over $236 million as a result of the increase in our cash balance, partially offset by a reduction in accounts receivable given the lower organic revenue during the period as well as an increase in contract liabilities due to advanced billing on certain long-term construction projects.  Other changes in key balance sheet positions of note are as follows: goodwill has decreased since December 31, 2019, as a result of the noncash impairment charge recognized during the second quarter of 2020, partially offset by an increase in goodwill resulting from businesses acquired or purchase price adjustments made during the year. Our identifiable intangible asset balance has decreased since the end of last year largely due to $60 million of amortization expense recorded during 2020, which was partially offset by incremental intangible assets recognized as a result of the acquisition of three businesses during calendar 2020.  Total debt has decreased by $35.7 million since the end of 2019, reflecting our net financing activity during the year. And course, debt-to-capitalization ratio has decreased to 11.9% from 13.2% in the year-ago period. Lastly, our stockholders' equity has decreased slightly since December 2019 as our net income was offset by share repurchases, dividend payments and postretirement plan liability adjustments made during 2020. Our balance sheet, in conjunction with the credit available to us, continues to put us in a position to invest in our business and achieve our strategic objectives as we look forward to 2021 and years beyond that. With my portion of the formal slide presentation concluded, I would like to get a drink of water, and return the call back to Tony. Tony?\nAnthony Guzzi : Hey, Mark, that's a well-deserved drink of water. And year-end was always the toughest and we've been doing it a long time together. Thanks, Mark, and I'm on page 14. Remaining performance obligation or RPO by segment and market sector. I'll go through the numbers briefly and then go deeper to the market trends we are seeing. As I stated in my remarks, total RPOs at the end of 2020 were a shade under $4.6 billion, up $559 million or 13.8% when compared to the year-ago level of $4.03 billion. The strength of our RPO and the associated bidding activities surprised us a bit given the uncertainty of the pandemic, economic dislocation and disruptions for the year. However, as we have said in the past, during uncertain and challenging times, we have often seen a flight to quality and fiscally strong construction and service providers prosper. It's still a little too early to tell by 2020 and now into 2021. It sure looked like one of those times. Oh, I'm sorry. I should probably repeat. My mic wasn't on. So I'm going to go on to page 14, remaining performance obligations by segment and market sector. Look, they're up $559 million or 13.8% for those that didn't hear it. And really, there's a flight to quality a lot of times when you move from 2020 into 2021, and this certainly looks like one of those times. Our domestic construction segments experienced strong project growth in 2020 with RPOs increasing $495 million or 15.2% since the end of 2019 as we continue -- and continue to see demand for electrical mechanical systems, both in new construction and retrofit projects. Our United States Building Services segment RPOs increased in the quarter as this segment's small project repair service work continue to rebound from its abrupt, almost hard stop at the beginning and the height of COVID-19. Some of this resumption is a return of regularly scheduled maintenance on mechanical systems and then the return of small project work. And some is focused, as you'd imagine, around modifications and improvements in IAQ, indoor air quality, which I will discuss in detail in a few slides. It was quite a recovery from the March, April and May time frame when the segment was hit especially hard as described earlier, with bookings down 40% in many cases. Over on the right side of the page, we show RPOs by market sector. Throughout 2020, we experienced strong year-over-year growth in the commercial, healthcare and water and wastewater sectors. Commercial projects, which make up 41% of that total RPOs, increased $297 million or close to 19% for the year. As we stated last quarter and continued to experience in the fourth quarter of this year, demand for hyper data -- scale data center construction has high demand, as does high-tech manufacturing, and warehousing and logistics also remain strong. We are a nationwide leader in this section of the commercial market sector, and quite frankly, I don't see any letup in this activity anytime soon. We are also in Part one design discussion on several large design build through process opportunities. For the year, healthcare project RPOs increased $207 million or 56%. And water and wastewater project RPOs grew similar by 57% to $173 million. As one might surmise, given the impact of the pandemic, healthcare as a sector of the nonresidential construction market is expected to be slightly higher in 2021 and likely better than that for us as our customers build new facilities and retrofit existing facilities. By the way, RPOs in these three market sectors are at all-time highs for us since we transitioned to RPO reporting from backlog reporting in March of 2018. The nonresidential market, as measured by the U.S. Census Bureau for put-in-place activity, remains a very large market, and it was roughly $800 billion at the end of December 31, 2020. It's down 5% in 2020. However, it is not a uniform market, given its size and breadth and opportunities still exist. On the next page, I will discuss how well-thought and patient capital allocation strategy has allowed this growth in our RPO base and growth to occur despite choppy and uncertain overall markets. And on nonresidential market, they decreased 5%. I'm now on page 15, capital allocation. We have long had a major market presence in mechanical and electrical construction services and have continued to allocate capital to fill in the white space, either geographically or by adding capability in these important segments. Further, we have used our capital to build leading capabilities in HVAC service, building controls and mechanical system retrofit. We have built that capability and capacity through organic growth and acquisition in a sustained manner over many years. We are also one of the country's leading life safety contractors. And this activity mostly resides in our mechanical, and that is the sprinkler fitters and electrical, fire alarm and security installation and upgrades and low-voltage systems construction segments. Again, these capabilities were built over a long period of time through acquisition and organic investment. These are concrete examples where we have built successful platforms that allow us to have the capability to serve a broad spectrum of customers with the right products and specialty trade capabilities. Our investment decisions and patience have allowed us to build and maintain capability through cycles and serve a diverse set of customer opportunities. We have not only invested in over 20 acquisitions and we spent around $555 million on those acquisitions since 2017 until today, but we also have returned significant cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. I'm now on page 16, titled Resilient Markets. As we discussed on the previous two pages, we have shown that we have very good diversity of demand at EMCOR, and we have used that capital to grow organically and through acquisition to allow us to build upon such diversity of demand and resiliency in our business. This is not an accident, but it is a part of our long-term capital allocation strategy as discussed on the previous page. For example, EMCOR's data center capabilities were built enhanced over a very long period of time. We started building the largest data centers in the country for financial institutions and the original hosting providers almost 20 years ago. Today, we build data centers that are five times larger to seven times larger than these previous \"large data centers.\" We have continued to grow that capability over the last five years and expanded through organic investment or acquisition or a combination of both. We are one of the leaders in the specialty contracting for these complex facilities. That's all the electrical trades, mechanical trades and sprinkler fitters. Data center construction is a good market for us, and we expect it to be for the foreseeable future. It is also a growing part of our maintenance activities. We have -- we are fortunate to have other markets that have shown resiliency. We continue to support our customers' e-commerce growth primarily through our life safety services and the construction of large cold storage and other warehouse facilities as our customers transform their warehouse networks to allow for more fast-paced growth. We continue to believe that we are very well positioned to support our customers as they build more resiliency into their supply chains by reshoring projects. We also continue to see significant opportunity for large and small design-build food processing clients. Health care is also a good market for us and has been for a very long period of time. These are complex facilities that are seeking to become more flexible in the delivery of their care in the long term. Water and wastewater is a market that we believe will have significant opportunity for us and has significant opportunity for us today and also in the next 3 to 5 years, especially in Florida. And finally, as I have discussed previously, is our position as a leading HVAC services contractor. We are in a compelling position to provide indoor air quality solutions and services. We see very strong demand currently and expect this to continue over many years. We have experienced and are continuing to experience strong demand for upgrading, enhancing HVAC and building control systems for both energy efficiency and flexibility of demand and use. This has always been a good market for EMCOR for many years, and it spans all market sectors. As discussed, serving these resilience markets is not by chance. We've built this capability over many years, and we have some of the best field leadership, trade supervision and skilled trades people in the industry to execute in these markets.  I'm now going to wrap this up on Page 17 and 18. As we enter 2021, we are still in the world of COVID-19 mitigation and restriction. The oil and gas markets are still depressed, and the non-residential market is expected to decline by another 3% to 5%. Despite that less-than-cheery backdrop, we expect to continue to perform well in 2020. We expect revenues of $9.2 billion to $9.4 billion and expect to earn $6.20 to $6.70 in earnings per diluted share. 2021 should be another year of outstanding performance. We will have to execute very well to maintain the 2020 record levels of operating income margins of 8.4% in our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments. We do expect to increase revenues, which may help us mitigate this challenge. Underlying this range are the following assumptions: our Industrial Services segment does not materially improve until the fourth quarter but gain strong momentum headed into 2020 as demand for refined products will continue to be challenged during 2021, especially through the end of the second quarter. The non-residential construction market will decline modestly.  We will continue to execute well in our more resilient rock market sectors to include manufacturing, commercial driven by data centers and logistics and warehousing, water and wastewater, energy retrofits and health care. Our end market diversity has been and continues to be a real strength of EMCOR. We do not expect a more restrictive COVID-19 environment than what we are operating in today. We do expect a more normal pre-COVID-19 operating environment to emerge as the year progresses. We are operating near 100% capability on our jobs with no meaningful COVID-19-induced issues. Our leadership and trades people have learned how to work and even prosper under the COVID precautions. We have learned to plan and execute, but always have the mindset that our employee safety comes first, which is nothing new or novel for us as it is one of our core values. We expect to continue to help our customers improve their facilities' air quality with indoor air quality solutions, improve energy efficiency through replacement projects and optimizing their systems. And we are going to help them bring back their employees back to work with an improved piece of mind through our efforts. Our ability to move to the upper range of our earnings guidance range will depend on the following: the nonresidential market, especially our more resilient markets, are stronger than projected because the bounce back is faster as the U.S. and the UK normalizes from COVID-19 restrictions. Our refining and petrochemical customers begin to gain more comfort with improved demand for re-refined products and increase their scope for this year's work performed by us. Our momentum in indoor air quality and efficiency projects continues to not only increase but accelerates further, and our productivity stays strong as we transition to more normal operating conditions. I'm going to talk a little bit about what happened in Texas last week as we have a significant business in Texas. Clearly, the power disruption in Texas last week affected not only EMCOR's business operations, customer sites, but also more importantly, our employees and their families. Many of our customers went to skeleton staff for 3 to 5 days, and many shut down operations almost completely. We have mostly resumed operations in our Industrial Services and also our construction services and Building Service customer sites. We will be there to help our customers complete their planned turnarounds, execute on planned maintenance and repairs related to the storm and to resume project work already underway or that was ready to start in the last few weeks. We have may, we may have work that was planned for the first quarter that will now extend into the second quarter that, and it may have had more activity in the first quarter than it will now have. We have discussed capital allocation earlier in the presentation in detail. We expect to continue to be balanced capital allocators as we have shown on the previous pages. We have more capital to allocate in balance, but we know how to do that. And however, our guidance contemplates that we will continue to be disciplined allocators between organic growth investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. And with that, Lara, I will take questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] So your first question will come from the line of Mr. Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson.\nBrent Thielman: Tony, you've gone from sort of a temporary lull in demand to what feels like some real urgency in the market to secure specialty service providers like yourself. I guess I'm wondering, is this an environment now where you feel like you can be even more selective about what you're after versus 3 or 6 months ago? Does this overall pressure on the non-res market that you think happens in '21, does that still leave some loose capacity out there and more competitiveness even on these more technical jobs?\nAnthony Guzzi: No. We didn't flinch. We don't operate in an environment where we just try to fill capacity. A couple things we don't pay attention to is market share. We try to figure out the best opportunities for our market. And we really don't pay attention to chasing low bids to just fill up our companies. So yes, somewhere back in May, there was nonsense floating around the market where people came back and wanted a COVID discount, and we respectfully said no. We are disciplined bidding. We have discipline on capital allocation. That doesn't change whether it's good markets or bad markets. \nBrent Thielman: Okay. And margins continue to be exceptional in the construction businesses. I guess I'm wondering these upticks in health care, water, wastewater, some of the other technical areas in the business, I mean, I assume that offers some more margin tailwinds as we work our way through 2021. Is that fair? \nAnthony Guzzi: Look, business is always a mix. And this mix is not only of end market served, but also contract structure. We pay attention, at this point where we're at right now, I think Mark would concur with me, we're a lot more focused on margin dollars than we are margin percentages. We like these margin percentages. But we've always said that our businesses operate in a band. We're up, at the upper end of that band. The midpoint of this band is fine with more volume, and I feel really good about how we're executing in the field right now. Mark? \nMark Pompa: Yes. Thank you. Brent, I can add, clearly, our performance in the last two calendar years has been quite exceptional from a margin contribution basis and would certainly, distorts the averages if you look at them for certainly over the short period. And I think Tony mentioned the discipline with regards to bidding and ultimately project and customer selection earlier to your first question. That hasn't changed and it's not going to change. And ultimately, if it makes sense for us to participate, we're going to do whatever we need to participate. And we know what our track record is, and we don't see any reason why that's going to change as we go forward in time. \nAnthony Guzzi: Yes, and I think it ties a little bit into the capital allocation. We're not big capital, organic capital users, a fixed investment in our business. But we do know how to supply it smartly. And I think some of the margin stretch you're seeing, in fact, I know some of the margin improvement we're seeing is because our means and methods have gotten better. We have gotten the implementation of technology, not only from point siting and job siting as we lay out a job and think about how that's going to construct on the site.  Our prefabrication in both our mechanical and electrical business continues to get stronger. We can kind of put more full-time resources against that to make sure best practice is spread throughout the company. And then that is enabled by what I would say is as good as anybody or maybe better than anybody use of building information modeling. Our subsidiary leadership and our segment leadership really understand this technology and how to implement it to drive efficiencies for our customers and for our employees to not only build faster and smarter, but safer.  And that's really helped us in this COVID environment because our means and methods and planning has always been good, but it really became exceptional over the past year. And I'd tie in another point here. I agree with you on the point that these more technically complicated systems, but the contract structure has changed. So typically, a water and wastewater job, a very good work and we have a terrific team that does that work, it's not going to be as profitable as a quick-turn commercial job doing energy efficiency work. I mean, that's just not how it works. And just something that I'd caution everybody on. Contract structure and type of work matters. And again, like I said earlier, margin dollars actually matter, too. \nBrent Thielman: Yes. That's helpful color. My last one is just on the indoor air quality opportunity. We've been talking about this for the last few quarters, seems to be perking up. One of the questions I had, Tony, is there anything about that type of work that might require additional investment in your platform and capabilities, things to address that opportunity? Do you feel like the platform is set to address that as we go forward?\nAnthony Guzzi : It's set. Training matters, and we have great training platform set, and we have some people to drive that training for us. And that's an underlying strength of EMCOR that's only gotten better through this COVID period. We're using our technological tools to drive out training faster and to a broader group of people as are we leveraging our peer groups better from data centers, low voltage, BIM, prefabrication and just our standard electrical, mechanical construction. Our guys are really sharing means and methods and how to service different customer demands. And that's one of the benefits of being EMCOR, the amount of learning that can go on across our organization. That sounds like a soft benefit. But when you're dealing with technical people, technical supervision and trades, it matters a lot because these are highly skilled people that know how to take the information, tailor it to their local market and their customers and drive a more effective solution for those customers. That's not easily replicated by a mom-and-pop contractor.\nOperator: Thank you Sir. Your next question will come from the line of Mr. Adam Thalhimer from Thompson, Davis. Sir your line is now live, go ahead please.\nAdam Thalhimer : Hey good morning guys. Great quarter, good outlook. Hey, Tony, it's been a long time since I've been taking up my revenue forecast to try to match consensus. Pretty healthy revenue guide for this year. Just curious, how does that flow down at a segment level, the revenues for 2021?\nAnthony Guzzi : Look, we don't give segment guidance, but I mean, you have to look at the RPOs and that will give you an indication in segment, right? Clearly, electrical, mechanical segments are our biggest segments, and their RPOs are up, healthy. And Building Services has momentum building. We're going to take a pass on having any discussion on why we see revenues flowing out for the year in Industrial Services. And you can see our commentary, we're not expecting anything heroic there until we get into 2022 when we think the market will have recovered.\nAdam Thalhimer : And then the minus 3% to 5% for kind of general nonres, is that basically in line with what you've been thinking for the last three to six months? Has that changed at all?\nAnthony Guzzi : No, that has not changed. And Adam, I think the wildcard that I can't really prognosticate on, these are consensus from every source that comes out of them. More guys are looking at them, the gals are looking at the same thing you're looking at to get there. It really hasn't changed. We didn't try to make an estimate back in the height of COVID restrictions back in April, May, June last year. We thought that was sort of a silly event to try to project 2021 at that time. Things have really sort of solidified here in the last five months, both from our external sources and the way we view the market from a compilation of those external sources. I think the one thing none of us quite understands yet is on especially on the smaller project side and the delay of award on the large project side there for a couple of months. What does this disruption that we all experienced in March, April, May last year, how does that manifest itself in a nonresidential market that has less restriction this year? Is that baked into the forecast? Is it not? I don't think anybody could figure that out, and I certainly can't either.\nAdam Thalhimer : Okay. Last one for me. Is it geographically focused, Tony? I mean, you threw in a little comment about weak New York and weaker California.\nAnthony Guzzi : The way Mark said that is California, New York were weak in 2020, weaker because of COVID-induced shutdowns. And where you really see that is some of the quicker-turn construction work. And then also not being able to revenue on sites because some of the sites were shut down in 2020, so we're catching back up. Here's what I would say. California, I think, should be OK. We do some very good energy savings work there, control systems work on the Building Services side. And on the construction side, we see our customers getting busy again and booking work. New York City is a different animal for a lot of people, right? I think the commercial part of New York City will be fine for us going out through third quarter when it should start rebounding as people come back to work and the city becomes busy again. I think the part that will remain challenged for us, and it's part of what we do, right? We did the Tappan Zee Bridge. We did Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel. We are good electrical infrastructure or providers of electrical services to those infrastructure projects in New York City and metro area. Clearly, those agencies that control that work are trying to figure out what their fiscal outlook looks like, part of which rests with this stimulus plan with its aid state and local governments. Whatever happens there, we'll see. And then that will take a lot to trickle down and figure out how to rebuild these folks' budgets to allow them to work on some actually maintenance infrastructure projects or capital projects in the future in New York City metro area. That's a very specific comment for us.\nAdam Thalhimer : Yes, that should be a strength for you.\nAnthony Guzzi : It is. Given enough time.\nOperator: Thank you Sir. Your next question will come from the line of Ms. Noelle Dilts from Stifel. Your line is now live, go ahead please.\nNoelle Dilts : Hi guys. Again, congrats on the strong quarter outlook. My first question was just looking at kind of the strength in data centers. And so looking at the growth in RPOs, you're probably facing a lot of growth on the mechanical side. So I was just curious, when you look at some of those data center opportunities, could you speak to the extent to which you're doing kind of both electric and mechanical work? Is there still some opportunity to sort of cross-sell those services? And are there any services you might look to add through acquisition that might kind of strengthen your offering or expand your offering in that market?\nAnthony Guzzi : Yes. Good question, Noelle. I mean, we don't necessarily bundle the services together, electrically, mechanically. But we work with the same customers. They know the EMCOR companies are there when we have both capabilities in the market. And there, both can execute well. So yes, I mean, it's something we look to do. I think we've made acquisitions to strengthen our market presence. An example of that is what we did with the company we bought in Central Iowa, which was a terrific company. And it's really been aided, they're good at what they do, and I think they would agree that they've been aided by EMCOR's strength in data center construction. And I would say the BKI acquisition, although many things that terrific team can do, data centers being one of it in markets we weren't in, in Oklahoma, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina. And then we built, both organically and through acquisition over the last couple of years, our capability to service not only data centers but warehousing logistics and the fire protection, which for us means sprinkler fitter work. I would say we probably are one of the leaders or have a very strong technical position to serve those very complex structures. So I don't think we're looking to get into the concrete business, the curtain wall business, landscaping business around data centers. But we will continue to look to strengthen our electrical, mechanical, building controls and life safety offerings into those facilities and also the other facilities that are supporting e-commerce.\nNoelle Dilts : Okay. And then on U.S. Industrial Services, obviously, the market remains very challenged, but you do have some competitors that have either announced that they're looking to kind of exit or sell some of those operations or at least streamline, permanently streamline some of their operations. Do you think as the market comes back, that might kind of strengthen your competitive position and potentially allow you to gain some share as you move forward?\nAnthony Guzzi: Look, we got a very good management team. We've got good operators in our local product lines and companies there, and we're one of the leading providers. We think we can help those facilities continue to become more efficient, stronger, help them as they look to do things that they've worked on for a while like introduce renewable diesel. And we look to be there to help them. I certainly don't think that this would be the time to exit a market on the bottom that I think will come back because I'm pretty sure we're going to be using refined products for quite some time. And then we have the ability to continue to strengthen pipeline networks in the midstream. So yes, I like being one of the leading providers. And I'd just point out here, it's less than 8% or so of what we do. We achieved what we did in 2020 with no significant contribution. They were profitable on an EBITDA basis. And from where we look at it now going into the back half of this year and into 2022, it should be upside from there. \nNoelle Dilts: Okay, great. And then last question, there are some -- there have been some reported shortages of things like copper cabling and other equipment. And obviously, was hearing a lot about construction input costs, increasing raw material costs. Are you -- is that something you're concerned about or watching or kind of impacting how you're thinking about the timing of projects at all? \nAnthony Guzzi: No. The way we think about that is we will get supply. Very -- I've been here a long time. I can count on one hand the number of times we've been supply constrained. And why is that so? We have very strong national relationships with some of the best distributors and suppliers in the business. And our guys can look all the way back through the distributor to secure supply on critical things like copper, sprinkler pipe, corrugated by all the things that we use. And look, we're there in good times and bad times with those distributor partners. And because of that, we get rewarded in times of shortages. The other thing is on the smaller jobs, those jobs are constantly repricing, right, because they have quick turns. On the larger jobs, again, because we've been good customers, because we are thoughtful in the way we approach supply chain, we typically can lock in what we need on those longer-term jobs. And where we can't, we're relatively successful in a time of escalating commodity prices by making sure that's built into the contract. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Mr. Sean Eastman from KeyBanc. Sir, your line is now live. Go ahead. \nSean Eastman: So you beat the top end of the pre-COVID earnings guidance, so not a bad outcome there. Congrats on that. I just wanted to level set on the guidance for '21. So clearly, the top line growth is pretty solid in the mid-single digits, but we're not getting the same flow-through on the earnings growth guidance. So just wanted to understand the moving pieces there. Is the biggest kind of chunk of that sort of just an assumed normalization in the construction segment margins in '21? Or am I not thinking about that correctly?\nAnthony Guzzi: I think it's saying we could operate within the bands that we operate in when we're executing well. And some of that has to do with mix and timing of projects. We can't sit here in March and know exactly how our significant work will we roll out, how much will be finished this year, how much won't be finished this year, how things will accelerate through the year. So we take a tempered view when you get to the bottom end, which is still very strong margin performance. And also, I think we are working to understand better the progression in Industrial Services, and that's sort of a hedge against that progression in Industrial Services. Mark?\nMark Pompa: Yes, Sean, to really kind of amplify Tony's comment, and I harken back to kind of commentary we had in 2019. 2020 was an unusual year for a whole host of reasons that everybody on this call is very aware of. But we had more significant work complete in 2020, and that leads to an uptick in margins as we close out projects, right, as those projects mature. And as we look at how the revenues are going to develop for 2021, we don't see the same level of significant project completion occurring in the calendar year. That's not to say that we're not going to get the same level of performance but certainly, leaves itself to an environment that would lead you to believe that at least on the electrical and mechanical side, you might see margins flat to slightly back up towards more historical averages. I mean, we're clearly well ahead of the 5-year and 10-year average for both of those segments. That's not to say that we're not striving to reset the bar at these new levels, but it's clearly mix-dependent. And more so, it's clearly, it's dependent on project life cycle. And it's just too early in the year to make that call.\nAnthony Guzzi: Right. Exactly. And look, we're talking 10 to 30 basis points on either side of this. I mean, we're not, we don't foresee a margin, big margin decrement. We also don't see big margin pickup either. So we're talking, like Mark, this could be a couple of projects finish or start. And we're certainly not going to say, hey, we don't want to start that project because we're worried about, we don't want to take that big work as we're worried about margin dilution of 10 or 15 basis points. I mean, you would agree that would be silly.\nSean Eastman: Yes. No, that makes sense. Really helpful. And obviously, another sort of strange year ahead for Industrial Services. But it'd be helpful if you could just remind us where that segment should be running from a margin perspective in a normalized environment. Because even though the recovery, the pace of the recovery is hard to determine here, it still seems like that will be a nice little tailwind in the out year, assuming life is getting back to normal slowly through the year, right?\nAnthony Guzzi: Yes. Our goal is to strive to get back to consistently 4.5% to 6.5% first. And after that, if mix helps us, we can do better. But that margin in that business needs to be rebuilt, right? It needs to, demand needs to resume, resumption of capacity needs to resume. All those things need to happen. And if we get into that band first, then we can worry about margin uptick from there. It's not going to be this immediate snapback, I don't think. It will come in through time as customers get more comfortable with scope increase. I mean, that's really how you perform here. You get to the site. The scope increases on the site. You have the overhead already dedicated to that site, and we can do better. And also customers are willing to spend on the ancillary services, and it's mix-dependent, too. The more we can do cleaning and shop operations as a percentage of our mix, the better we're going to do because it absorbs overhead. And it also is, look, what we're doing there is a little more proprietary versus just standard turnaround field services. \nOperator: And presenters, I am now, I'm not seeing any more further questions from the line. I'll be turning the call over back to you for any closing remarks. \nAnthony Guzzi: Thank you all very much for listening. It's a long call. It always is at the end-of-the-year call. I think I heard four times or five times that our execution was good, but also that we have a very positive outlook on our view of 2021 with what we know today. And of course, I'd always like to thank all of our employees. It's been a heck of a year, and we're performing, and we've learned how to work with adversity. We know we're contractors. We do know how to adapt and overcome. Thank you all very much.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Thank you so much, presenters. And again, thank you, everyone, for participating. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Stay safe, and have a lovely day.",

            "name": "Anthony Guzzi",
            "content": "Yes. Let me start the call this morning by congratulating Maxine on her promotion and also welcoming Ron Johnson as our newest EMCOR Director. Maxine, congratulations, and Ron, welcome to EMCOR's Board. I'm going to be covering Pages 4 through 8 here in my opening comments. First, I'd like to welcome all of you, and thank you for your interest and/or investment in EMCOR. In 2020, we had a terrific year despite an extremely challenging operating environment. We delivered extraordinary results through disciplined execution and resilience. I am extremely proud of our EMCOR team. I don't think any of us could have imagined this high level of performance when we started to understand the impact of COVID-19 on our operations in March of 2020. In 2020, we had $8.8 billion in revenues and set records on an adjusted basis for earnings per diluted share of $6.40, operating income of $490 million and operating income margin of 5.6%. We also had record operating cash flow of $806 million. Mark's going to cover all the financials in much more detail and especially the key components of our cash flow performance in his financial commentary, inclusive of the fourth quarter and full year 2020 performance. We delivered these stellar results because we have diversity and demand for our services. And we have end markets that have proved resilient and have provided us with opportunities to execute well for our customers. These results are a testament to our skilled employees and our subsidiary, segment and corporate leadership, who kept focused and resolute through the ever-changing environment in 2020. Across our company, we worked hard to keep our employees safe, and it was our #1 priority throughout the year. We innovated and found ways to maintain and even improve our productivity. We became leaner and even more expeditious in our decision-making. And we're able to leverage technology to connect our leadership effectively to the front lines despite COVID-19 protocols. We did not let obstacles become excuses. Instead, we overcame obstacles, and we delivered exceptional results.  I now want to highlight some of our segment performance. Our Electrical Construction segment performed well with 8.4% operating income margins. Despite the disruptions in some of our operations from COVID-19 and due to shutdowns, we still posted outstanding results. These results were driven by excellent execution in the commercial sector driven by data center and telecommunication and really excellent execution across all market sectors. We've performed the work well and really innovated on the means, the methods and the scheduling so that we can not only keep our employees safe, but enhance our productivity.  Our Mechanical Construction segment had an exceptional year by any measure. We also had 8.4% operating income margins with exceptional performance across the commercial sector, again driven by telecommunications and data centers. And we also had strength in warehousing, manufacturing, water and wastewater and the health care end markets. We showed great innovation through increased use of BIM or building information modeling and prefabrication and worked hard to keep our employees safe and productive. We believe in both of our construction segments that we not only met, but we exceeded our customers' expectations.  Our United States Building Services segment team showed grit and resilience as they faced the COVID-19 disruption in late March, April and May, with many of our customer sites not acceptable, bookings off as much as 40% in some of our subsidiary companies and in some of our product lines and a very cautious resumption of decision-making by our customers to allow us to resume service and projects. We did rebound robustly from mid-June forward, and we're well prepared to execute project work for our customers that optimize their equipment and control systems, improve the wellness of their facilities through indoor air quality or IAQ solutions and sought to help our customers return to work safely and productively.  We also served as the boots on the ground for our customers to keep lightly occupied buildings, campuses and schools operational, functioning and safe over the past 10 months. We are well positioned to keep serving our customers as they reopen and seek to make their building safe, efficient and productive for their employees. Our U.K. Building Services segment mirrored the performance of our U.S. Building Services segment. We navigated the severe lockdown actions in the U.K. and continued to keep our customers productive, operational and able to conduct their businesses. We also made organizational changes that enhanced our leaders' responsiveness by making our organization even flatter, more aligned and leaner, which has led to crisper and more efficient decision-making.  Our U.K. team continues to win in the market as we have a culture of innovation and execution. As you all know, our Industrial Services segment mostly serves the downstream oil and gas or refining and petrochemical markets. These end markets had a severe dislocation of demand as planes stop flying and people stop driving. And this segment was also impacted at the beginning of the year with a disruption in the global oil and gas markets. We cut costs aggressively and maintain profitability on an EBITDA basis. We are well positioned with demand for our services returns, which is not likely to happen until the fourth quarter of this year. We expect the larger, more sophisticated, well-capitalized service providers to emerge stronger. And yes, we are clearly one of them. We exit 2020 with our remaining performance obligations or RPOs at an all-time high of $4.6 billion, 13.8% higher than the year-ago period. We have very strong RPOs and are continuing to benefit from the very strong demand for data center construction, logistics and supply chain support, especially with our fire protection trade, health care, water and wastewater. And we expect manufacturing to be as strong also as 2021 progresses. We expect to benefit from increasing demand for IAQ, that's indoor air quality, and building efficiency projects and solutions. We depart 2020 with an exceptional balance sheet that allows us the room to grow and build for the future while continuing to return cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  2020 was an extraordinary year, and we performed exceptionally well, which is a real testament to our people, our subsidiary leaders, our segment staff and leadership and our corporate staff and leadership. And really, I'd just like to thank all of them.  I will now turn the discussion over to Mark. Hey, Mark, that's a well-deserved drink of water. And year-end was always the toughest and we've been doing it a long time together. Thanks, Mark, and I'm on page 14. Remaining performance obligation or RPO by segment and market sector. I'll go through the numbers briefly and then go deeper to the market trends we are seeing. As I stated in my remarks, total RPOs at the end of 2020 were a shade under $4.6 billion, up $559 million or 13.8% when compared to the year-ago level of $4.03 billion. The strength of our RPO and the associated bidding activities surprised us a bit given the uncertainty of the pandemic, economic dislocation and disruptions for the year. However, as we have said in the past, during uncertain and challenging times, we have often seen a flight to quality and fiscally strong construction and service providers prosper. It's still a little too early to tell by 2020 and now into 2021. It sure looked like one of those times. Oh, I'm sorry. I should probably repeat. My mic wasn't on. So I'm going to go on to page 14, remaining performance obligations by segment and market sector. Look, they're up $559 million or 13.8% for those that didn't hear it. And really, there's a flight to quality a lot of times when you move from 2020 into 2021, and this certainly looks like one of those times. Our domestic construction segments experienced strong project growth in 2020 with RPOs increasing $495 million or 15.2% since the end of 2019 as we continue -- and continue to see demand for electrical mechanical systems, both in new construction and retrofit projects. Our United States Building Services segment RPOs increased in the quarter as this segment's small project repair service work continue to rebound from its abrupt, almost hard stop at the beginning and the height of COVID-19. Some of this resumption is a return of regularly scheduled maintenance on mechanical systems and then the return of small project work. And some is focused, as you'd imagine, around modifications and improvements in IAQ, indoor air quality, which I will discuss in detail in a few slides. It was quite a recovery from the March, April and May time frame when the segment was hit especially hard as described earlier, with bookings down 40% in many cases. Over on the right side of the page, we show RPOs by market sector. Throughout 2020, we experienced strong year-over-year growth in the commercial, healthcare and water and wastewater sectors. Commercial projects, which make up 41% of that total RPOs, increased $297 million or close to 19% for the year. As we stated last quarter and continued to experience in the fourth quarter of this year, demand for hyper data -- scale data center construction has high demand, as does high-tech manufacturing, and warehousing and logistics also remain strong. We are a nationwide leader in this section of the commercial market sector, and quite frankly, I don't see any letup in this activity anytime soon. We are also in Part one design discussion on several large design build through process opportunities. For the year, healthcare project RPOs increased $207 million or 56%. And water and wastewater project RPOs grew similar by 57% to $173 million. As one might surmise, given the impact of the pandemic, healthcare as a sector of the nonresidential construction market is expected to be slightly higher in 2021 and likely better than that for us as our customers build new facilities and retrofit existing facilities. By the way, RPOs in these three market sectors are at all-time highs for us since we transitioned to RPO reporting from backlog reporting in March of 2018. The nonresidential market, as measured by the U.S. Census Bureau for put-in-place activity, remains a very large market, and it was roughly $800 billion at the end of December 31, 2020. It's down 5% in 2020. However, it is not a uniform market, given its size and breadth and opportunities still exist. On the next page, I will discuss how well-thought and patient capital allocation strategy has allowed this growth in our RPO base and growth to occur despite choppy and uncertain overall markets. And on nonresidential market, they decreased 5%. I'm now on page 15, capital allocation. We have long had a major market presence in mechanical and electrical construction services and have continued to allocate capital to fill in the white space, either geographically or by adding capability in these important segments. Further, we have used our capital to build leading capabilities in HVAC service, building controls and mechanical system retrofit. We have built that capability and capacity through organic growth and acquisition in a sustained manner over many years. We are also one of the country's leading life safety contractors. And this activity mostly resides in our mechanical, and that is the sprinkler fitters and electrical, fire alarm and security installation and upgrades and low-voltage systems construction segments. Again, these capabilities were built over a long period of time through acquisition and organic investment. These are concrete examples where we have built successful platforms that allow us to have the capability to serve a broad spectrum of customers with the right products and specialty trade capabilities. Our investment decisions and patience have allowed us to build and maintain capability through cycles and serve a diverse set of customer opportunities. We have not only invested in over 20 acquisitions and we spent around $555 million on those acquisitions since 2017 until today, but we also have returned significant cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. I'm now on page 16, titled Resilient Markets. As we discussed on the previous two pages, we have shown that we have very good diversity of demand at EMCOR, and we have used that capital to grow organically and through acquisition to allow us to build upon such diversity of demand and resiliency in our business. This is not an accident, but it is a part of our long-term capital allocation strategy as discussed on the previous page. For example, EMCOR's data center capabilities were built enhanced over a very long period of time. We started building the largest data centers in the country for financial institutions and the original hosting providers almost 20 years ago. Today, we build data centers that are five times larger to seven times larger than these previous \"large data centers.\" We have continued to grow that capability over the last five years and expanded through organic investment or acquisition or a combination of both. We are one of the leaders in the specialty contracting for these complex facilities. That's all the electrical trades, mechanical trades and sprinkler fitters. Data center construction is a good market for us, and we expect it to be for the foreseeable future. It is also a growing part of our maintenance activities. We have -- we are fortunate to have other markets that have shown resiliency. We continue to support our customers' e-commerce growth primarily through our life safety services and the construction of large cold storage and other warehouse facilities as our customers transform their warehouse networks to allow for more fast-paced growth. We continue to believe that we are very well positioned to support our customers as they build more resiliency into their supply chains by reshoring projects. We also continue to see significant opportunity for large and small design-build food processing clients. Health care is also a good market for us and has been for a very long period of time. These are complex facilities that are seeking to become more flexible in the delivery of their care in the long term. Water and wastewater is a market that we believe will have significant opportunity for us and has significant opportunity for us today and also in the next 3 to 5 years, especially in Florida. And finally, as I have discussed previously, is our position as a leading HVAC services contractor. We are in a compelling position to provide indoor air quality solutions and services. We see very strong demand currently and expect this to continue over many years. We have experienced and are continuing to experience strong demand for upgrading, enhancing HVAC and building control systems for both energy efficiency and flexibility of demand and use. This has always been a good market for EMCOR for many years, and it spans all market sectors. As discussed, serving these resilience markets is not by chance. We've built this capability over many years, and we have some of the best field leadership, trade supervision and skilled trades people in the industry to execute in these markets.  I'm now going to wrap this up on Page 17 and 18. As we enter 2021, we are still in the world of COVID-19 mitigation and restriction. The oil and gas markets are still depressed, and the non-residential market is expected to decline by another 3% to 5%. Despite that less-than-cheery backdrop, we expect to continue to perform well in 2020. We expect revenues of $9.2 billion to $9.4 billion and expect to earn $6.20 to $6.70 in earnings per diluted share. 2021 should be another year of outstanding performance. We will have to execute very well to maintain the 2020 record levels of operating income margins of 8.4% in our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments. We do expect to increase revenues, which may help us mitigate this challenge. Underlying this range are the following assumptions: our Industrial Services segment does not materially improve until the fourth quarter but gain strong momentum headed into 2020 as demand for refined products will continue to be challenged during 2021, especially through the end of the second quarter. The non-residential construction market will decline modestly.  We will continue to execute well in our more resilient rock market sectors to include manufacturing, commercial driven by data centers and logistics and warehousing, water and wastewater, energy retrofits and health care. Our end market diversity has been and continues to be a real strength of EMCOR. We do not expect a more restrictive COVID-19 environment than what we are operating in today. We do expect a more normal pre-COVID-19 operating environment to emerge as the year progresses. We are operating near 100% capability on our jobs with no meaningful COVID-19-induced issues. Our leadership and trades people have learned how to work and even prosper under the COVID precautions. We have learned to plan and execute, but always have the mindset that our employee safety comes first, which is nothing new or novel for us as it is one of our core values. We expect to continue to help our customers improve their facilities' air quality with indoor air quality solutions, improve energy efficiency through replacement projects and optimizing their systems. And we are going to help them bring back their employees back to work with an improved piece of mind through our efforts. Our ability to move to the upper range of our earnings guidance range will depend on the following: the nonresidential market, especially our more resilient markets, are stronger than projected because the bounce back is faster as the U.S. and the UK normalizes from COVID-19 restrictions. Our refining and petrochemical customers begin to gain more comfort with improved demand for re-refined products and increase their scope for this year's work performed by us. Our momentum in indoor air quality and efficiency projects continues to not only increase but accelerates further, and our productivity stays strong as we transition to more normal operating conditions. I'm going to talk a little bit about what happened in Texas last week as we have a significant business in Texas. Clearly, the power disruption in Texas last week affected not only EMCOR's business operations, customer sites, but also more importantly, our employees and their families. Many of our customers went to skeleton staff for 3 to 5 days, and many shut down operations almost completely. We have mostly resumed operations in our Industrial Services and also our construction services and Building Service customer sites. We will be there to help our customers complete their planned turnarounds, execute on planned maintenance and repairs related to the storm and to resume project work already underway or that was ready to start in the last few weeks. We have may, we may have work that was planned for the first quarter that will now extend into the second quarter that, and it may have had more activity in the first quarter than it will now have. We have discussed capital allocation earlier in the presentation in detail. We expect to continue to be balanced capital allocators as we have shown on the previous pages. We have more capital to allocate in balance, but we know how to do that. And however, our guidance contemplates that we will continue to be disciplined allocators between organic growth investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. And with that, Lara, I will take questions. No. We didn't flinch. We don't operate in an environment where we just try to fill capacity. A couple things we don't pay attention to is market share. We try to figure out the best opportunities for our market. And we really don't pay attention to chasing low bids to just fill up our companies. So yes, somewhere back in May, there was nonsense floating around the market where people came back and wanted a COVID discount, and we respectfully said no. We are disciplined bidding. We have discipline on capital allocation. That doesn't change whether it's good markets or bad markets. Look, business is always a mix. And this mix is not only of end market served, but also contract structure. We pay attention, at this point where we're at right now, I think Mark would concur with me, we're a lot more focused on margin dollars than we are margin percentages. We like these margin percentages. But we've always said that our businesses operate in a band. We're up, at the upper end of that band. The midpoint of this band is fine with more volume, and I feel really good about how we're executing in the field right now. Mark? Yes, and I think it ties a little bit into the capital allocation. We're not big capital, organic capital users, a fixed investment in our business. But we do know how to supply it smartly. And I think some of the margin stretch you're seeing, in fact, I know some of the margin improvement we're seeing is because our means and methods have gotten better. We have gotten the implementation of technology, not only from point siting and job siting as we lay out a job and think about how that's going to construct on the site.  Our prefabrication in both our mechanical and electrical business continues to get stronger. We can kind of put more full-time resources against that to make sure best practice is spread throughout the company. And then that is enabled by what I would say is as good as anybody or maybe better than anybody use of building information modeling. Our subsidiary leadership and our segment leadership really understand this technology and how to implement it to drive efficiencies for our customers and for our employees to not only build faster and smarter, but safer.  And that's really helped us in this COVID environment because our means and methods and planning has always been good, but it really became exceptional over the past year. And I'd tie in another point here. I agree with you on the point that these more technically complicated systems, but the contract structure has changed. So typically, a water and wastewater job, a very good work and we have a terrific team that does that work, it's not going to be as profitable as a quick-turn commercial job doing energy efficiency work. I mean, that's just not how it works. And just something that I'd caution everybody on. Contract structure and type of work matters. And again, like I said earlier, margin dollars actually matter, too. It's set. Training matters, and we have great training platform set, and we have some people to drive that training for us. And that's an underlying strength of EMCOR that's only gotten better through this COVID period. We're using our technological tools to drive out training faster and to a broader group of people as are we leveraging our peer groups better from data centers, low voltage, BIM, prefabrication and just our standard electrical, mechanical construction. Our guys are really sharing means and methods and how to service different customer demands. And that's one of the benefits of being EMCOR, the amount of learning that can go on across our organization. That sounds like a soft benefit. But when you're dealing with technical people, technical supervision and trades, it matters a lot because these are highly skilled people that know how to take the information, tailor it to their local market and their customers and drive a more effective solution for those customers. That's not easily replicated by a mom-and-pop contractor. Look, we don't give segment guidance, but I mean, you have to look at the RPOs and that will give you an indication in segment, right? Clearly, electrical, mechanical segments are our biggest segments, and their RPOs are up, healthy. And Building Services has momentum building. We're going to take a pass on having any discussion on why we see revenues flowing out for the year in Industrial Services. And you can see our commentary, we're not expecting anything heroic there until we get into 2022 when we think the market will have recovered. No, that has not changed. And Adam, I think the wildcard that I can't really prognosticate on, these are consensus from every source that comes out of them. More guys are looking at them, the gals are looking at the same thing you're looking at to get there. It really hasn't changed. We didn't try to make an estimate back in the height of COVID restrictions back in April, May, June last year. We thought that was sort of a silly event to try to project 2021 at that time. Things have really sort of solidified here in the last five months, both from our external sources and the way we view the market from a compilation of those external sources. I think the one thing none of us quite understands yet is on especially on the smaller project side and the delay of award on the large project side there for a couple of months. What does this disruption that we all experienced in March, April, May last year, how does that manifest itself in a nonresidential market that has less restriction this year? Is that baked into the forecast? Is it not? I don't think anybody could figure that out, and I certainly can't either. The way Mark said that is California, New York were weak in 2020, weaker because of COVID-induced shutdowns. And where you really see that is some of the quicker-turn construction work. And then also not being able to revenue on sites because some of the sites were shut down in 2020, so we're catching back up. Here's what I would say. California, I think, should be OK. We do some very good energy savings work there, control systems work on the Building Services side. And on the construction side, we see our customers getting busy again and booking work. New York City is a different animal for a lot of people, right? I think the commercial part of New York City will be fine for us going out through third quarter when it should start rebounding as people come back to work and the city becomes busy again. I think the part that will remain challenged for us, and it's part of what we do, right? We did the Tappan Zee Bridge. We did Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel. We are good electrical infrastructure or providers of electrical services to those infrastructure projects in New York City and metro area. Clearly, those agencies that control that work are trying to figure out what their fiscal outlook looks like, part of which rests with this stimulus plan with its aid state and local governments. Whatever happens there, we'll see. And then that will take a lot to trickle down and figure out how to rebuild these folks' budgets to allow them to work on some actually maintenance infrastructure projects or capital projects in the future in New York City metro area. That's a very specific comment for us. It is. Given enough time. Yes. Good question, Noelle. I mean, we don't necessarily bundle the services together, electrically, mechanically. But we work with the same customers. They know the EMCOR companies are there when we have both capabilities in the market. And there, both can execute well. So yes, I mean, it's something we look to do. I think we've made acquisitions to strengthen our market presence. An example of that is what we did with the company we bought in Central Iowa, which was a terrific company. And it's really been aided, they're good at what they do, and I think they would agree that they've been aided by EMCOR's strength in data center construction. And I would say the BKI acquisition, although many things that terrific team can do, data centers being one of it in markets we weren't in, in Oklahoma, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina. And then we built, both organically and through acquisition over the last couple of years, our capability to service not only data centers but warehousing logistics and the fire protection, which for us means sprinkler fitter work. I would say we probably are one of the leaders or have a very strong technical position to serve those very complex structures. So I don't think we're looking to get into the concrete business, the curtain wall business, landscaping business around data centers. But we will continue to look to strengthen our electrical, mechanical, building controls and life safety offerings into those facilities and also the other facilities that are supporting e-commerce. Look, we got a very good management team. We've got good operators in our local product lines and companies there, and we're one of the leading providers. We think we can help those facilities continue to become more efficient, stronger, help them as they look to do things that they've worked on for a while like introduce renewable diesel. And we look to be there to help them. I certainly don't think that this would be the time to exit a market on the bottom that I think will come back because I'm pretty sure we're going to be using refined products for quite some time. And then we have the ability to continue to strengthen pipeline networks in the midstream. So yes, I like being one of the leading providers. And I'd just point out here, it's less than 8% or so of what we do. We achieved what we did in 2020 with no significant contribution. They were profitable on an EBITDA basis. And from where we look at it now going into the back half of this year and into 2022, it should be upside from there. No. The way we think about that is we will get supply. Very -- I've been here a long time. I can count on one hand the number of times we've been supply constrained. And why is that so? We have very strong national relationships with some of the best distributors and suppliers in the business. And our guys can look all the way back through the distributor to secure supply on critical things like copper, sprinkler pipe, corrugated by all the things that we use. And look, we're there in good times and bad times with those distributor partners. And because of that, we get rewarded in times of shortages. The other thing is on the smaller jobs, those jobs are constantly repricing, right, because they have quick turns. On the larger jobs, again, because we've been good customers, because we are thoughtful in the way we approach supply chain, we typically can lock in what we need on those longer-term jobs. And where we can't, we're relatively successful in a time of escalating commodity prices by making sure that's built into the contract. I think it's saying we could operate within the bands that we operate in when we're executing well. And some of that has to do with mix and timing of projects. We can't sit here in March and know exactly how our significant work will we roll out, how much will be finished this year, how much won't be finished this year, how things will accelerate through the year. So we take a tempered view when you get to the bottom end, which is still very strong margin performance. And also, I think we are working to understand better the progression in Industrial Services, and that's sort of a hedge against that progression in Industrial Services. Mark? Right. Exactly. And look, we're talking 10 to 30 basis points on either side of this. I mean, we're not, we don't foresee a margin, big margin decrement. We also don't see big margin pickup either. So we're talking, like Mark, this could be a couple of projects finish or start. And we're certainly not going to say, hey, we don't want to start that project because we're worried about, we don't want to take that big work as we're worried about margin dilution of 10 or 15 basis points. I mean, you would agree that would be silly. Yes. Our goal is to strive to get back to consistently 4.5% to 6.5% first. And after that, if mix helps us, we can do better. But that margin in that business needs to be rebuilt, right? It needs to, demand needs to resume, resumption of capacity needs to resume. All those things need to happen. And if we get into that band first, then we can worry about margin uptick from there. It's not going to be this immediate snapback, I don't think. It will come in through time as customers get more comfortable with scope increase. I mean, that's really how you perform here. You get to the site. The scope increases on the site. You have the overhead already dedicated to that site, and we can do better. And also customers are willing to spend on the ancillary services, and it's mix-dependent, too. The more we can do cleaning and shop operations as a percentage of our mix, the better we're going to do because it absorbs overhead. And it also is, look, what we're doing there is a little more proprietary versus just standard turnaround field services. Thank you all very much for listening. It's a long call. It always is at the end-of-the-year call. I think I heard four times or five times that our execution was good, but also that we have a very positive outlook on our view of 2021 with what we know today. And of course, I'd always like to thank all of our employees. It's been a heck of a year, and we're performing, and we've learned how to work with adversity. We know we're contractors. We do know how to adapt and overcome. Thank you all very much."

            "name": "Mark Pompa",
            "content": "Thank you, Tony, and good morning to everyone participating on the call today. For those accessing this presentation via the webcast, we are now on Slide 7. Over the next several slides, I will provide a detailed discussion of our fourth quarter results before moving to our full year performance, some of which Tony outlined during his opening commentary. As a reminder, all financial information discussed during this morning's call is included in our consolidated financial statements within both our earnings release announcement and Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier today.  So let's discuss EMCOR's fourth quarter performance. Consolidated revenues of $2.3 billion in quarter 4 are down $122.4 million or 5.1% from 2019. Our fourth quarter results include $55.4 million of revenues attributable to businesses acquired pertaining to the period of time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in last year's fourth quarter. Acquisition revenues positively impacted both our United States Mechanical Construction and United States Building Services segments. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired, fourth quarter 2020 consolidated revenues decreased $177.9 million or 7.4% organically. Our segment performance was mixed within the quarter, with most of our reportable segments experiencing quarter-over-quarter organic revenue declines. In general, we have seen reductions in revenues in those geographies or market sectors which are continuing to be most significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, when we consider the incremental revenue generated from our acquisitions, we were successful in generating fourth quarter revenue growth from 3 of our 5 reportable segments. Specific segment revenue performance for the quarter is as follows: United States Electrical Construction segment revenues of $493.5 million decreased $71 million or 12.6% from quarter 4 2019. Revenues declined across multiple market sectors due to the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the associated containment and mitigation measures as well as the curtailment of capital spending by some of our customers. Consistent with my third quarter commentary, this segment experienced a significant reduction in revenues from industrial project work within the manufacturing market sector, where certain of our electrical businesses perform services for both midstream and upstream oil and gas customers. Additionally, the segment's operations that serve the metropolitan New York and California markets continue to face revenue headwinds as these geographies remain some of the most restrictive with regards to COVID protocols. United States Mechanical Construction segment revenues of $969.4 million increased $73.8 million or 8.2% from quarter 4 2019. Excluding acquisition revenues of $24.2 million, the segment's revenues increased $49.6 million or 5.5% organically. Revenue growth within the quarter was broad based across most market sectors, with commercial and health care representing the most significant period-over-period increases. These revenue gains were partially offset by a quarterly revenue decline in manufacturing market sector activity due to the completion or substantial completion of certain large projects during the early part of 2020. This revenue performance represents an all-time quarterly record for our United States Mechanical Construction segment and surpasses the previous record set in 2019's fourth quarter. EMCOR's total domestic construction business fourth quarter revenues of $1.46 billion increased $2.7 million or less than 0.25%. United States Building Services revenues of $568.1 million increased $29.1 million or 5.4%. However, when excluding acquisition revenues of $31.2 million, this segment's quarterly revenues decreased $2.1 million or 40 basis points. Revenue gains within their mobile mechanical services division resulting from incremental contribution from acquired companies and their commercial site-based services division due to new contract awards or scope expansion on certain existing contracts were partially offset by a quarter-over-quarter revenue decline within the segment's energy services division due to reduced large project activity when compared to 2019's fourth quarter. Consistent with our United States Mechanical Construction Services segment, revenue performance within our United States Building Services segment represents an all-time quarterly record. United States Industrial Services revenues of $135.5 million decreased by $163.7 million or 54.7% as this segment continues to be impacted by the negative macroeconomic conditions and uncertainty within the markets in which it operates. Cost control and cash preservation actions taken by customers of this segment have resulted in the suspension of capital spending programs and the curtailment of maintenance activity, which has severely impacted demand for our Industrial Service offerings. With the rise in telecommuting and the various restrictions on travel in response to COVID-19, there have been significant reductions in both vehicle miles driven and airline miles traveled, which is further prolonging the weakened demand this segment has been experiencing since late quarter 1 of 2020. United Kingdom Building Services segment revenues of $115 million increased $9.4 million or 8.9% from last year's quarter. Revenue gains for the quarter resulted from strong project activity as well as incremental revenue from new contract awards. Additionally, fourth quarter 2020 revenues were positively impacted by $2.9 million as a result of favorable foreign exchange rate movement in the period.  Please turn to Slide 8. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $244.6 million reflects an increase of $3.7 million from quarter four 2019. The current period includes approximately $4.4 million of incremental expenses from businesses acquired, inclusive of intangible asset amortization, resulting in an organic quarter-over-quarter decrease of approximately $700,000. A reduction in salaries expense due to a decrease in head count necessitated by lower organic revenue as well as reduced travel and entertainment expenses due to a combination of cost-avoidance measures as well as restricted company travel were the primary reasons for the organic decline in SG&A.  These decreases were largely offset by an increase in quarterly incentive compensation expense due to EMCOR's actual operating performance exceeding its previously forecasted 2020 full year results. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses totaled 10.7% in quarter four 2020 versus 10% in the year-ago period. The quarter-over-quarter increase can be attributed to the reduction in our consolidated quarterly revenues without a commensurate decrease in certain of our fixed overhead costs, including those of our Industrial Services segment as we do not deem the current operating environment to be permanent.  Our assessment continues to be based on our evaluation of future market opportunities. And we expect to see some return to normalcy in industrial maintenance and capital spending when we ultimately move beyond the depressed demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Reported operating income for the quarter of $137.6 million represents a $14.7 million or 12% increase when compared to operating income of $122.9 million in last year's fourth quarter. This operating income performance eclipses our previously established all-time quarterly record, which was achieved in 2020's third quarter.  Our fourth quarter operating margin was 6%, which compares favorably to the 5.1% of operating margin reported in 2019's fourth quarter. We experienced the operating margin expansion within each of our reportable segments other than our U.S. Industrial Services segment, which is reporting an operating loss for the fourth quarter and our UK Building Services segment, which achieved a consistent margin in each year's quarterly period. Specific quarterly performance by reportable segment is as follows: our United States Electrical Construction segment had operating income of $43.4 million, which increased by $2.1 million from the comparable 2019 period. Reported quarterly operating margin is 8.8% and represents a 150 basis point improvement over 2019's fourth quarter.  This increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin is largely attributable to increased gross profit contribution from commercial market sector activities, inclusive of numerous telecommunications construction projects. These gross profit gains were partially offset by reduced gross profit contribution from the transportation and manufacturing market sectors due to both the closeout of projects in prior periods as well as the continued headwinds attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Fourth quarter operating income of the United States Mechanical Construction Services segment of $100.4 million represents a $31.5 million increase from last year's quarter, while operating margin in the quarter of 10.4% represents a 270 basis point improvement over 2019. This segment has continued to experience strength in the majority of the market sectors we serve, most notably demonstrated by increased gross profit contribution from project activity in the commercial, health care and institutional market sectors.  In addition, our Mechanical Construction segment experienced a more favorable mix of work than in the prior year and benefited from strong performance by our fire protection operations. Our combined U.S. construction business is reporting a 9.8% operating margin and $143.7 million of operating income, which has increased from 2019's fourth quarter by $33.5 million or 30.4%. Operating income for United States Building Services of $28 million represents a $3.8 million increase from last year's fourth quarter, and operating margin of 4.9% represents an improvement of 40 basis points when compared to the prior year. This segment experienced improved gross profit performance from its mobile mechanical services division, inclusive of incremental contribution from acquired companies. In addition, the segment continues to benefit from reduced levels of selling, general and administrative expenses due to cost-mitigation actions implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our United States Industrial Services segment operating loss of $8.2 million represents a decline of $21.3 million, which compares to operating income of $13.1 million in last year's fourth quarter. As mentioned earlier on today's call as well as during my commentary on each of our last 2 quarterly conference calls, our Industrial Services segment has been significantly impacted by the adverse macroeconomic conditions within the oil and gas industry, including the dramatic decline in demand for refined oil products resulting from travel restrictions and other containment and mitigation measures imposed in response to COVID-19. These conditions have resulted in considerable reductions in capital spending by certain of our customers, which has led to a decrease in demand for this segment's service offerings. This environment was further exacerbated by an active hurricane season, which resulted in the suspension of planned maintenance activities that would have occurred during both quarters 3 and 4 of 2020.  Tony will speak to our 2021 expectations overall as well as our expectations for this segment later in this morning's call. United Kingdom Building Services operating income of $4.2 million represents an increase of approximately $300,000 over quarter 4 of 2019. Operating margin was 3.7% for both quarter periods. We are now on Slide 9. Additional financial items of significance for the quarter not previously addressed are as follows: quarter 4 gross profit of $383.9 million or 16.8% of revenues is improved over last year's quarter by $19.1 million and 160 basis points of gross margin. Restructuring expenses in 2020's fourth quarter pertain to the realignment of management resources within our combined U.S. construction operations. Diluted earnings per common share of $1.45 compares to $1.54 per diluted share in last year's fourth quarter. Adjusting our 2020 quarterly performance for the negative impact on our income tax rate resulting from the nondeductible portion of the noncash impairment charges recording -- recorded during the second quarter of 2020, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2020, is $1.86, which favorably compares to last year's fourth quarter by $0.32 or nearly 21%. Our tax rate for quarter 4 of 2020 is 41.8%, which is significantly higher than the tax rate for the corresponding 2019 period due to the nondeductibility of the majority of the impairment charges just referenced. My last comment on Slide 9 is with respect to our $259.5 million of operating cash flow in the quarter, which favorably compares to $178.8 million of operating cash flow in the year-ago period and reflects the continued effective management of working capital by our subsidiary leadership teams. Our operating cash flow was aided by the organic decline in revenues, which resulted in a contraction in accounts receivable. Additionally, the deferral of the employer's portion of social security taxes in the United States benefited our cash flow by approximately $35.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2020. On a full year basis, the social security tax deferrals, coupled with the deferral of value-added tax in the United Kingdom, has favorably impacted our 12-month operating cash flow by approximately $117.3 million. These amounts will be repaid in 2021 and 2022. And obviously, we'll have the opposite effect on our operating cash flow in such future periods. Please turn to Slide 10. With the fourth quarter commentary complete, I will now augment Tony's introductory remarks on EMCOR's annual performance.  Consolidated revenues of $8.8 billion represent a decrease of $377.6 million or 4.1% when compared to our record annual revenues in 2019 of $9.17 billion. Our year-to-date results include $269.6 million of revenues attributable to businesses acquired pertaining to the period of time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in the 2019 period. Acquisitions positively impacted each of our United States Electrical Construction, United States Mechanical Construction and the United States Building Services segments. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired, year-to-date revenues decreased organically 7.1%, primarily as a result of the significant revenue contraction experienced during quarter 2 as the majority of our operations were most significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during such period. In addition, our annual revenues were negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for certain of our service offerings within our United States Electrical Construction services and United States Industrial Services segments as a result of the adverse conditions experienced within the oil and gas industry.  Discrete segment revenue performance for full year 2020 is as follows: United States Electrical Construction segment revenues of $1.97 billion decreased $243.2 million or 11% from 2019's $2.22 billion of revenues; acquisitions contributed $25.4 million of incremental revenues, resulting in an organic decline of $268.5 million or 12.1%. Revenue contraction within the majority of the market sectors in which we operate. Most notably, the commercial and manufacturing market sectors were the primary drivers of this year's year-over-year decrease. As I mentioned in my commentary on our fourth quarter results, although this segment has a diverse geographic footprint, a number of its operating companies within both the metropolitan New York and California markets were severely impacted by COVID protocols, which resulted in a decrease in the number of short-duration project opportunities as well as various project delays. These impacts, coupled with the completion or substantial completion of certain large projects in 2019, contributed to the decline in organic annual revenues.  In addition, and as previously referenced, certain of our operations in the segment which are exposed to the upstream and midstream oil and gas sector experienced a significant decline in demand in 2020. Partially offsetting these revenue reductions were increased revenues from project activities within the institutional and hospitality market sectors during the year. United States Mechanical Construction revenues of $3.49 billion increased $145.2 million or 4.3% compared to 2019. Acquisitions contributed $188.8 million of incremental revenues to the segment, which, when excluded, results in an organic revenue decline of $43.7 million or 1.3% from 2020. This organic decrease can be largely attributed to reduced project volume within the manufacturing market sector with a heavy concentration in the food processing submarket sector as a result of the completion or substantial completion of certain large projects in 2019. Similar to our United States Electrical Construction segment, this segment additionally experienced the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a reduced number of short-duration project opportunities during calendar 2020. United States Building Services segment revenues of $2.11 billion increased $3.2 million or less than 0.5%. Acquisitions contributed $55.4 million of revenues, resulting in an organic revenue decline of 2.5% when compared to full year 2019. The decrease in project and building controls activities within the segment's mobile mechanical services division, largely as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in the temporary closure of certain customers' facilities, coupled with the decrease in large project activity within the segment's energy services division were the primary contributors to such organic revenue reduction.  In addition, the segment experienced a decrease in revenues from its government services division as a result of the loss of certain contracts not renewed pursuant to rebid. These revenue contractions were partially offset by increased customer demand for certain services aimed at improving the indoor air quality within their facilities as well as an increase in revenues within the segment's commercial site-based services division as a result of new contract awards and scope expansion on certain existing contracts. United States Industrial Services segment revenues of $797.5 million decreased $290.1 million or 26.7% from 2019's $1.09 billion of revenues. At the risk of sounding repetitive, for most of 2020, the segment has been severely impacted by negative conditions and uncertainty within the markets in which it operates due to the dislocation between crude oil supply and demand resulting from COVID-19 and geopolitical tensions within OPEC. In addition, during the back half of 2020, the segment experienced suspension and deferral maintenance in capital projects by its customers as a result of hurricane and tropical storm activity in the United States Gulf Coast region. Revenues of our United Kingdom Building Services segment for 2020 increased 1.7% to $430.6 million, primarily as a result of new maintenance contract awards within the commercial and institutional market sectors. Revenues were also favorably impacted by $2.3 million as a result of exchange rate movement in the pound sterling year-over-year.  Please turn to Slide 11. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $903.6 million represent 10.3% of revenues as compared to $893.5 million or 9.7% of revenues in 2019. Full year 2020 SG&A includes $29.6 million of incremental expenses, inclusive of intangible asset amortization pertaining to businesses acquired. Excluding such incremental amounts, our SG&A has decreased $19.4 million on an organic basis, primarily as a result of certain cost reductions resulting from our actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As referenced during my quarter commentary, the increase in SG&A as a percentage of revenues is a result of the organic decrease in our revenue without a commensurate decrease in certain of our fixed overhead costs as we do not deem the current operating environment to be permanent. 2020's year-to-date operating income is $256.8 million. Adjusting this amount to exclude the noncash impairment loss on goodwill, identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets recorded in the second quarter, our non-GAAP operating income for the year was $489.6 million. This compares to operating income of $460.9 million for full year 2019 and represents a $28.7 million or 6.2% improvement year-over-year.  Despite the headwinds experienced in 2020, 3 of our 5 reportable segments achieved higher operating income and higher operating margins than that of the prior year. Of the 2 segments which did not, United States Building Services is reporting a modest decline of just over 1%, while our United States Industrial Services segment suffered a significant year-over-year reduction, resulting in an operating loss for 2020. With regard to each segment's discrete performance, I will start with our electrical, United States Electrical Construction segment. Their 2020 operating income of $166.5 million represents an all-time segment record, and it is an increase of $4.8 million or 3% compared to the prior year. Operating margin for 2020 is 8.4%, which is 110 basis points higher than 2019. This year-over-year improvement in operating income dollars was due to a reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses due to cost-control measures enacted during the course of 2020. The increase in operating margin for the year was a result of an increase in gross profit margin given favorable project execution and a more profitable mix of work within this segment. These improvements in gross profit margin were partially offset by an increase in the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to revenues as a result of the year-over-year revenue contraction within the Electrical Construction segment. United States Mechanical Construction operating income of $292.5 million increased $67.5 million or 30% over 2019 levels, and operating margin reached 8.4% versus 6.7% in the prior year. Acquired companies contributed incremental operating income of $9.3 million, inclusive of $12.7 million of amortization expense associated with identifiable intangible assets. The increase in operating income for 2020 was primarily due to strong project performance throughout the year in the majority of the market sector served by this segment, resulting in an increase in annual gross profit. The 170 basis point improvement in operating margin was also a result of our solid project execution and improved gross profit margin, most notably within the manufacturing and commercial market sectors. These increases in gross profit and gross profit margin were partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily as a result of an increase in incentive compensation expense due to the improved year-over-year operating performance for this segment. United States Building Services operating income for 2020 of $113.4 million declined by $1.3 million or 1.2% due to a reduction in year-over-year large project activity within the segment's energy services division as well as decreased project and building control opportunities within their mechanical services division due to both temporary closure and restricted access to certain customer facilities impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. These reductions were partially offset by incremental operating income contribution from companies acquired, which totaled $4.5 million, inclusive of $3.2 million of amortization expense associated with identifiable intangible assets. In addition, this segment experienced increased gross profit resulting from greater demand for certain services aimed at improving indoor air quality as various customers made changes to their HVAC systems in advance of their employees returning to work as recommended by the Center for Disease Control. Operating margin of 5.4% was consistent with the prior year as a reduction in gross profit margin was offset by a decrease in the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to revenues due to certain cost-reduction measures taken during 2020. Our United States Industrial Services segment incurred an operating loss of $2.8 million for 2020 as compared to operating income of $44.3 million in 2019. As referenced numerous times during this morning's call, this segment was the most severely impacted by the pandemic as well as the other macroeconomic factors affecting the oil and gas industry. This segment implemented significant cost reductions during the year in an effort to mute the year-over-year decline. However, as previously discussed, this segment's overhead structure includes a significant investment in fixed infrastructure, including plant and equipment. As we view current market conditions to be -- as to be temporary, that infrastructure is needed to respond to changes in demand patterns once they ultimately recover.  Operating income of our United Kingdom Building Services segment of $20.7 million or 4.8% of revenues compares to operating income of $18.3 million or 4.3% of revenues in the prior year. The $2.3 million improvement is largely due to an increase in gross profit from new maintenance contract awards, while the 50 basis point expansion in operating margin is attributable to both the increase in gross profit margin as well as a reduction in the ratio of selling and general and administrative expenses to revenues.  SG&A of this segment benefited from various cost-control initiatives implemented by our UK team. We are now on Slide 12. Additional key financial data on Slide 12 not addressed during my full year commentary is as follows: year-to-date gross profit of $1.4 billion is greater than 2019's gross profit by $39.5 million, while gross margin of 15.9% is higher than last year's 14.8% by 110 basis points. Total restructuring costs of $2.2 million are increased from 2019 due to actions taken during 2020 to both realign certain management functions as well as right size our cost structure in light of the revenue headwinds we faced.  Diluted earnings per common share was $2.40 compared to $5.75 per diluted share a year ago. When adjusting this amount for the impact of the noncash impairment charges recorded in 2020 second quarter, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $6.40 as compared to the same $5.75 in last year's annual period. This represents a $0.65 or 11.3% improvement year-over-year.  We are now on Slide 13. As outlined on this slide, EMCOR's liquidity profile remains strong despite the headwinds we faced during the course of 2020. Our cash balance has increased from $358.8 million at December 31, 2019, to $902.9 million at the end of 2020. Operating cash flow of $806.4 million, aided by the FICA and VAT cash tax deferrals previously referenced, was the primary driver of this increase.  Operating cash flow was partially offset by cash used in investing activities of nearly $95 million, predominantly representing payments for acquisitions of businesses and capital expenditures as well as cash used in financing activities, which totaled $172 million and consisted of the repurchase of our common stock, net repayments under our credit facility and dividends paid to our stockholders. Working capital has increased by over $236 million as a result of the increase in our cash balance, partially offset by a reduction in accounts receivable given the lower organic revenue during the period as well as an increase in contract liabilities due to advanced billing on certain long-term construction projects.  Other changes in key balance sheet positions of note are as follows: goodwill has decreased since December 31, 2019, as a result of the noncash impairment charge recognized during the second quarter of 2020, partially offset by an increase in goodwill resulting from businesses acquired or purchase price adjustments made during the year. Our identifiable intangible asset balance has decreased since the end of last year largely due to $60 million of amortization expense recorded during 2020, which was partially offset by incremental intangible assets recognized as a result of the acquisition of three businesses during calendar 2020.  Total debt has decreased by $35.7 million since the end of 2019, reflecting our net financing activity during the year. And course, debt-to-capitalization ratio has decreased to 11.9% from 13.2% in the year-ago period. Lastly, our stockholders' equity has decreased slightly since December 2019 as our net income was offset by share repurchases, dividend payments and postretirement plan liability adjustments made during 2020. Our balance sheet, in conjunction with the credit available to us, continues to put us in a position to invest in our business and achieve our strategic objectives as we look forward to 2021 and years beyond that. With my portion of the formal slide presentation concluded, I would like to get a drink of water, and return the call back to Tony. Tony? Yes. Thank you. Brent, I can add, clearly, our performance in the last two calendar years has been quite exceptional from a margin contribution basis and would certainly, distorts the averages if you look at them for certainly over the short period. And I think Tony mentioned the discipline with regards to bidding and ultimately project and customer selection earlier to your first question. That hasn't changed and it's not going to change. And ultimately, if it makes sense for us to participate, we're going to do whatever we need to participate. And we know what our track record is, and we don't see any reason why that's going to change as we go forward in time. Yes, Sean, to really kind of amplify Tony's comment, and I harken back to kind of commentary we had in 2019. 2020 was an unusual year for a whole host of reasons that everybody on this call is very aware of. But we had more significant work complete in 2020, and that leads to an uptick in margins as we close out projects, right, as those projects mature. And as we look at how the revenues are going to develop for 2021, we don't see the same level of significant project completion occurring in the calendar year. That's not to say that we're not going to get the same level of performance but certainly, leaves itself to an environment that would lead you to believe that at least on the electrical and mechanical side, you might see margins flat to slightly back up towards more historical averages. I mean, we're clearly well ahead of the 5-year and 10-year average for both of those segments. That's not to say that we're not striving to reset the bar at these new levels, but it's clearly mix-dependent. And more so, it's clearly, it's dependent on project life cycle. And it's just too early in the year to make that call."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the EMCOR Group Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed in mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Ms. Jamie Baird with FTI Consulting, you may begin.\nJamie Baird: Thank you, Lara, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the EMCOR Group conference call. We are here today to discuss the company\u2019s 2020 third quarter results, which were reported this morning. I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Matz, Executive Vice President of Shared Services, who will introduce management. Kevin, please go ahead.\nKevin Matz: Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone.

For call participants not accessing the conference call via the Internet, this presentation, including the slides will be archived in the Investor Relations section of our website under Presentations. You can find this at emcorgroup.com. With that said, please let me turn the call over to Tony. Tony?\nTony Guzzi: Yes. Good morning, and thanks, Kevin. I am going to start on pages four through six. We had an exceptional quarter, s reported with respect to operating income at $135.9 million, operating income percentage at 6.2% and with respect to earnings per diluted share at $1.76 on a non-GAAP adjusted basis. We earned revenues of $2.2 billion in the quarter and had operating cash flow of $270 million. We had excellent operational performance and cost control. Our team executed with focus, discipline and precision. We continue to take steps to keep our skilled trades workforce safe, motivated and productive. We achieved this performance despite a very difficult operating environment for our EMCOR Industrial Services segment, which you know, focuses on downstream, petrochemical, and oil and gas and refining. We have structurally reduced our SG&A by about $7 million to $9 million per quarter on a go-forward basis. The exceptional performance of our segments Building, Industrial Services gap thus demonstrating how the diversity and balance at EMCOR can work for our shareholders. I will cover some of the highlights by segment and I will cover the broad themes and practices that have driven our performance during these challenging times. Our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments had outstanding performance in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. We leveraged our cost structure across a solid mix of projects, returned strong and robust operating income margins of 9.2% in our Electrical Construction segment and 9.0% in our Mechanical Construction segment. We leveraged a lower cost structure, but more importantly, had exceptional field performance on our projects. We did benefit on some project closeout to resolutions. We always have some of those, something that Mark will cover in more detail. But the underlying performance and productivity in these segments is as good as we have ever had, period, full stop. Our Building -- U.S. Building Services segment performed exceptionally well, with a record quarterly operating income percentage of 6.9%. Our commercial site-based business had their best third quarter ever and resets their cost base to position us for even more success in the future as we grow the business. We have a very good customer mix. Our customers are demanding, but by involving us in their maintenance capital spending, they provide us with the opportunity to add value through incremental small projects and service activity. Our Government business also had a very good quarter. In addition, we had excellent repair service and project performance in our mobile mechanical services division. Our repair services aided by a hot summer coupled with significant demand for our IAQ or indoor air quality products and services. We also are near flat year-to-date for project bookings on an organic basis, which show significant recovery from the large drop in organic bookings in April and May. We also completed the ninth acquisition in August that will build our project capabilities and allow for long-term service growth in the Washington D.C. market. Our Industrial Services segment had a tough quarter in line with what we expected and discussed on our second quarter earnings call. Demand has dropped significantly across the industry and that coupled with successive hurricanes made for a very difficult quarter. This is a tough environment for Industrial Services as we focus on petrochemical and refining. However, we are well-positioned when our customers rebound. We have reset the business through aggressive cost cutting and redeploying personnel to the work that is available. The issue is our field supervision is absorbed and productive. However, they are capable of and what is available today and that is where the leverage is in this segment. Our U.K. segment continues to a steady performance and continues to build on a strong market position. Our strong customer relationships give us opportunities to not only meet their service needs, but also their maintenance and project retrofit needs. I want to take this opportunity to share with you how we have succeeded in this challenging operating environment across EMCOR. These actions and themes are why we have had this exceptional year-to-date performance across our business. Number one, we kept our focus as an organization. As we have moved through this ever-changing environment in 2020, we have stayed focused on accomplishing our mission for our customers. We are already a flat organization and we had direct communication at multiple levels. We became even flatter with even better communication across our company. Number two, employee safety is and has been our number one priority throughout this pandemic. Our people were able to keep this priority paramount as it is one of our core values. We just had to implement these practices in a different way. Our team knows we avoid shortcuts and we always emphasize worker safety. This unrelenting focus and commitment to safety is not new to us. It is one of the main reasons we can fill the best team in the industry. Number three, we work together across this large decentralized organization by focusing on the task at hand and we have sought to comply at all times with a multitude of regulations, programs and procedures in this constantly changing environment. Our staff has made sure that our subsidiaries had the best available information to implement the practices needed to keep progress moving on a project or a service demand. Again, teamwork and mutual respect for each other are core values of EMCOR. Number four, we stayed focused not only on safety but also productivity. Our people took ownership of job sites, brought solutions forward that allowed us to at least maintain the productivity we bid in the jobs through better scheduling, adjusted work practices, more prefabrication and better job site logistics. In many ways, we were uniquely trained to perform in this constantly changing environment. We are a team of very successful trade contractors, who know how to react and adapt to changing markets and job site conditions. Number five, we have positioned ourselves into some good term -- long-term markets, which I will talk about later, such as healthcare manufacturing, high-tech manufacturing, data centers, commercial and food processing. We offer valuable services in these markets through our electrical trades, our HVAC technicians, our pipefitters, welders, millwrights, sprinkler fitters and plumbers. We are able to move between markets with skill and agility that can handle the most complex construction and service opportunities within these markets. Number six, we were prepared and trained to serve our customers with new products when the pandemic hit. We bundled together our services and products related to IAQ/indoor air quality and building wellness, and had these solutions ready to present to our customers when we were able to reenter buildings, campuses and industrial facilities. We have helped and continue to help our customers reopen with more peace of mind, by improving the airflow and air quality in their workplaces. Number seven, we became leaner and more productive. We cut costs early and deep in some of our businesses. We did not wait to react. We found new ways to work through technology. And finally number eight, we leveraged our scale, our suppliers worked with us to make sure we had the necessary personal protective equipment necessary for our people to do their jobs. We had the job materials we needed to be successful, despite supply disruptions that may have impacted others. We shared ideas on how to keep safe but also stay productive. For me, it\u2019s been humbling to see this high level of execution during these difficult times. It speaks to the leadership of our segment and subsidiary leaders who look for solution when obstacles are in front of them. And our highly skilled and dedicated workforce who continued to work and serve our customers throughout these difficult times driven by this pandemic. I cannot thank them enough for all that they do for EMCOR every day, our customers and our shareholders. And with that, Mark, I will turn it to you.\nMark Pompa: Thank you, Tony, and good morning to everyone participating on today\u2019s call. For those accessing this presentation via the webcast we are now on slide seven. Over the next several slides, I will augment Tony\u2019s opening commentary and EMCOR\u2019s third quarter performance, as well as provide an update on our year-to-date results through September 30. All financial information referenced is derived from a consolidated financial statements, included in both our earnings release announcement and Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this morning. So let\u2019s revisit and expand our review of EMCOR\u2019s third quarter performance. Consolidated revenues of $2.2 billion, are down $86 million or 3.8% from quarter three 2019. Our third quarter results include $81.4 million of revenues attributable to businesses acquired, pertaining to the time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in last year\u2019s third quarter. Acquisition revenues positively impacted both our United States Mechanical Construction and United States Building Services segments. Excluding the impacted businesses acquired, third quarter consolidated revenues decreased approximately $167.5 million or 7.3%. Unlike our results for the second quarter of 2020 where each of our reportable segments had quarter-over-quarter revenue declines, we did see revenue gains in three of our five segments during the third quarter of this year. However, when you remove the impact of businesses acquired, all of our U.S. reportable segments experienced organic revenue declines period-over-period, as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the disruption within the oil and gas markets are still impacting a number of our businesses. United States Electrical Construction revenues of $508.9 million decreased $45.8 million or 8.3% from 2019\u2019s third quarter. Revenue declined across multiple market sectors due to the continuing impact of the pandemic, including the associated containment and mitigation measures, as well as the curtailment of certain capital spending by some of our customers. This segment additionally experienced a significant reduction in revenues within the manufacturing or industrial market sector, where certain of our electrical businesses perform services for both midstream and upstream oil and gas customers. Not dissimilar to our Industrial Services segment, the Electrical Construction segment has experienced numerous project deferrals, specifically in the manufacturing and industrial market sector resulting from cost control actions initiated by many of their customers within the broader oil and gas industry. United States Mechanical Construction segment revenues of $891.5 million, increased $22.3 million or 2.6% from quarter three of 2019. The results of the segment represent record third quarter revenue performance. Excluding acquisition revenues of $61.1 million, the segment\u2019s revenues decreased $38.8 million or 4.5% organically. Reductions in quarter-over-quarter revenues from the manufacturing market sector, inclusive of activities within the food processing submarket sector, as well as the healthcare market sector due to project completions in the prior year are the primary reasons for this segment\u2019s organic revenue decline. EMCOR\u2019s total Domestic Construction business third quarter revenues of $1.4 billion, decreased by $23.5 million or 1.6%. United States Building Services quarterly revenues of $551.5 million, increased $19.4 million or 3.7% and represents an all-time quarterly record for this segment. Excluding acquisition revenues of $20.3 million, this segment\u2019s revenues decreased approximately $900,000 or less than 0.75%. Reduced building control project activities due to access restrictions created by the COVID-19 pandemic were almost entirely offset by increased small project revenues, including indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity project volume from this segment\u2019s Government Services division, as well as an increase in demand for certain services aimed at improving indoor air quality in response to the pandemic and in line with the recommendations from the CDC. Tony will comment further on our IAQ capabilities later in his presentation. United States Industrial Services revenues of $139.7 million, decreased $94.4 million or 40.3%, as this segment continues to be impacted by the negative macroeconomic conditions and uncertainty within the markets in which it operates. Additionally, our quarterly performance within this segment was adversely affected by work stoppages resulting from hurricane and tropical storm activity in the Gulf Coast region, where the majority of our Industrial Services operations are located. United Kingdom Building Services segment revenues of $110.1 million, increased $12.5 million or 12.7% from last year\u2019s quarter. Revenue gains for the quarter resulted from new maintenance contract awards, as well as strong project activity across our customer portfolio. In addition, revenues of this segment were positively impacted by $5 million, as a result of favorable foreign exchange rate movements within the quarter. Please turn to slide eight. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $226.8 million represent 10.3% of third quarter revenues and reflect an increase of $6.7 million. The current year\u2019s quarter includes approximately $8.9 million of incremental expenses from businesses acquired, inclusive of intangible asset amortization, resulting in an organic quarter-over-quarter decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately $2.2 million. SG&A expenses for the third quarter of 2019 were favorably impacted by $4.5 million of insurance recovery and legal settlements within the Industrial Services segment. When excluding these recoveries from the prior year period, the adjusted organic decline in 2020\u2019s third quarter SG&A is $6.7 million. Quarter-over-quarter reductions in salaries and travel and entertainment expenses due to a combination of cost-cutting measures and the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic were partially offset by an increase in quarterly incentive compensation expense due to EMCOR\u2019s improved operating performance during the period and our revised upward expectations for full year 2020. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of revenues is due to the reduction in quarterly consolidated revenues without a commensurate decrease in certain of our fixed overhead cost as we do not deem the current operating environment to be permanent. This is consistent with our assessment during this year\u2019s second quarter. Additionally, with quarter-over-quarter and sequential increase in total incentive compensation expense previously mentioned, our SG&A as a percentage of revenues was unfavorably impacted by approximately 50 basis points within the third quarter of 2020. Reported operating income for the quarter of $135.9 million represented $20.1 million increase or 17.4%, as compared to operating income of $115.7 million in 2019\u2019s third quarter. This represents an all-time quarterly operating income record for EMCOR, which is quite remarkable performance when you consider the economic backdrop. Our third quarter operating margin of 6.2%, which favorably compares to the 5.1% of operating margin reported in last year\u2019s third quarter. We experienced operating margin expansion within each of our reportable segments other than our U.S. Industrial Services segment, which is reporting an operating loss for the quarter and our U.K. Building Services segment, which was essentially flat period-over-period. Specific quarterly performance by reporting segments is as follows, our U.S. Electrical Construction segment operating income of $47.1 million increased $13.4 million from the comparable 2019 period. Reported operating margin of 9.2% represents a 310-basis-point improvement over last year\u2019s third quarter. This improvement in both operating income dollars and operating margin is largely attributable to increased gross profit contribution from commercial market sector activities, inclusive of numerous telecommunication construction projects. In addition, operating income and operating margin of this segment benefited from favorable project closeouts within the transportation and institutional market sectors, which positively impacted quarterly operating margin in the current year by 70 basis points. Third quarter operating income of our U.S. Mechanical Construction services segment of $80 million represents an $18.8 million increase from last year\u2019s quarter, while operating margin in the quarter of 9% represents a 200-basis-point improvement over 2019. Despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, this segment has experienced increased gross profit from projects within the majority of the market sectors in which it operates. In addition, a more favorable mix of work within the both -- within both the manufacturing and the commercial market sectors drove the improvement in quarterly operating margin. Our combined U.S. Construction business is reporting a 9.1% operating margin and $127.1 million of operating income, which has increased from 2019\u2019s third quarter by $32.3 million or 34%. For the third quarter of 2020, operating income and operating margin for our U.S. Building Services segment was $38.2 million and 6.9%, respectively. The performance of this segment represents an all-time quarterly record in terms of both operating income and operating margin. Operating income increased by $3.2 million over last year\u2019s third quarter and operating margin improved by 30 basis points. These increases were primarily due to increased gross profit and gross profit margin from this segment\u2019s commercial site-based services division. In addition, this segment\u2019s results for the current quarter, benefited from lower selling, general and administrative expenses, due to cost-cutting measures enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our U.S. Industrial Services operating loss of $9.8 million represents a decrease of $15.4 million, compared to operating income of $5.6 million in last year\u2019s third quarter. As briefly mentioned earlier on this call, as well as during my commentary on our second quarter earnings call, this segment has been significantly impacted by adverse macroeconomic conditions within the oil and gas industry, as well as the dramatic decline in demand for refined oil products due to the travel restrictions and other containment and mitigation measures imposed in response to COVID-19. These conditions have resulted in reduced capital spending and the implementation of various cost-cutting measures by certain of our customers, which has resulted in a decrease in demand for the services provided by this segment. Compounding this reduced demand and as a -- and as I referenced during my revenue commentary, the Gulf Coast region has been impacted by numerous named storms during 2020\u2019s hurricane season, which resulted in the suspension of planned maintenance activities as our customers focused on storm preparation and recovery efforts. U.K. Building Services operating income of $5.3 million represents an approximately $600,000 increase over 2019\u2019s third quarter due to an increase in gross profit within this segment. Operating margin of 4.8% is slightly reduced from 2019\u2019s third quarter operating margin of 4.9%. We are now on slide nine. Additional financial items of significance for the quarter not addressed on my previous slides are as follows, quarter three gross profit of $363.2 million or 16.5% of revenues has improved over last year\u2019s quarter by $27.2 million and 180 basis points of gross margin. We experienced quarter-over-quarter improvement in gross profit dollars in all reportable segments other than our Industrial Services segment due to the unfavorable market conditions previously outlined. Diluted earnings per common share of $1.11, compares to $1.45 per diluted share in last year\u2019s third quarter. Adjusting our record quarterly performance for the negative impact on our income tax rate resulting from the non-deductible portion of the non-cash impairment charges recorded during the second quarter of this year, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2020, is $1.76, which favorably compares to last year\u2019s quarter by $0.31 or 21.4%. My last comment on this slide is a continuation of my income tax rate commentary, which as you can see on the bottom of slide nine is 54.7% for the quarter due to the non-deductibility of the majority of quarter two\u2019s non-cash impairment charges. With one quarter of 2020 remaining, I anticipate that our full year tax rate will be between 53% and 54%, which is a downward revision from the previous range provided on our quarter two call. As everyone on this call knows, this range can change, if we have any significant discrete tax items that occur during the fourth quarter. Please turn to slide 10. With my quarter commentary complete, let\u2019s now turn our attention to EMCOR\u2019s year-to-date results through September 30th. Revenues of $6.52 billion represent a decrease of $255.1 million or 3.8% when compared to revenues of $6.77 billion in the corresponding prior year period. Our year-to-date results include $214.1 million of revenues attributable to businesses acquired, pertaining to the period of time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in the 2019 year-to-date period. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired, year-to-date revenues decreased organically 6.9%, primarily as a result of the significant revenue contraction experienced during quarter two, given the containment and mitigation measures mandated by certain of our customers, as well as numerous governmental authorities in response to COVID-19. Year-to-date gross profit of $1 billion is higher than the 2019 nine-month period by $20.4 million or 2.1%. Year-to-date gross margin is 15.5%, which favorably compares to 2019\u2019s year-to-date gross margin of 14.6%. The year-over-year gross margin improvement was largely driven by our combined U.S. Construction business. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $659 million represent 10.1% of revenues, as compared to $652.5 million or 9.6% of revenues in the prior year period. Year-to-date 2020 includes $25.2 million of incremental SG&A, inclusive of intangible asset amortization pertaining to businesses acquired. Excluding such incremental costs, our SG&A has decreased on an organic basis by approximately $18.7 million year-over-year. Reported operating income for the first nine months of 2020 is $119.2 million. Adjusting this amount to exclude the non-cash impairment loss on goodwill, identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets recorded in the second quarter results in non-GAAP operating income of $352 million for 2020\u2019s nine-month period, as compared to $338 million for the corresponding 2019 year-to-date period. This adjusted non-GAAP operating income represents a $13.9 million or 4.1% improvement year-over-year. Diluted earnings per common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, is $0.96. When adjusting this amount for the impact of the non-cash impairment charges previously mentioned, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $4.54, as compared to $4.22 in last year\u2019s nine-month period. This represents a $0.32 or 7.6% improvement period-over-period. We are now on slide 11. EMCOR\u2019s liquidity profile continues to improve as we just completed another quarter of strong cash flow generation, bringing our year-to-date operating cash flow to $546.8 million. Our operating cash flow has benefited from the effective management of working capital by our subsidiary leadership teams, coupled with the impact of certain government measures enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which allow for the deferral of the employer\u2019s portion of social security tax payments and the remission of value-added tax for our U.K. subsidiary. On a year-to-date basis, these measures have favorably impacted operating cash flow by approximately $81 million. With this strong operating cash flow, cash on hand has increased to $679.3 million from the approximately $359 million on our year-end 2019 balance sheet and is the primary driver of the increase in our September 30th working capital balance. Other changes in key balance sheet positions of note are as follows, goodwill has decreased since December 31, 2019, as a result of a non-cash impairment charge recognized during the second quarter of 2020, partially offset by an increase in goodwill resulting from the businesses acquired during the year -- 2020 year-to-date period. Largely as a result of $44.8 million of amortization expense recorded during the first nine months of this year, our identifiable intangible asset balance has decreased since December 31, 2019. Similar to our goodwill balance, this decrease was partially offset by incremental intangible assets recognized, as a result of the acquisition of two businesses during the first nine months of this year. Total debt has decreased by approximately $30 million since the end of 2019, reflecting our net financing activity during the year. Although, not included on this slide due to the periods presented, EMCOR has paid down approximately $273 million of borrowings under its credit facility, inclusive of borrowings executed during 2020. EMCOR\u2019s debt to capitalization ratio has decreased to 12.3% as of September 30th. Lastly, our stockholder\u2019s equity has decreased since December 2019, as our share repurchase activity and dividend payments for the nine-month period of 2020 have exceeded our net income due to the impairment loss recognized in the second quarter. Due to our strong cash flow performance in concert with our available credit, EMCOR remains in a very strong position to take advantage of any market opportunities that may be present in future periods. With my lengthy portion of this slide presentation concluded, I would like to give the call back to Tony. Thank you.\nTony Guzzi: Thanks, Mark. And that\u2019s what happens when we are in the third quarter, right? Thank you. And I am going to be on page 12, remaining performance obligations by segment and market sector. Total RPOs at the end of the third quarter were a little over $4.5 billion, up $495 million or 12.3% when compared to the September 2019 level of $4 billion. RPOs likewise increased the same amount $494 million for the first nine months of 2020, with all of this growth being organic except for approximately $86 million relating to two acquisitions in the current 12-month period. Taken together, our Mechanical and Electrical Construction segment RPOs have increased $409 million or 12.4% since the year ago period, 7% of this growth is organic with the balance being RPOs that came with our November \u201819 acquisition of BKI, a full service mechanical contractor headquartered in the Atlanta area. I should note here that thus far in 2020, BKI has more than doubled its RPOs total in the first nine months of this year, as they continue to win work, including projects in the data center, manufacturing and healthcare markets. The integration of BKI has gone very well due to the exceptional team they have. They really are a terrific team so we are thrilled to have them on our team. Building Services segment RPOs increased in the quarter as this segment\u2019s small project, repair service work also continues to regain its footing. Remember the small project work in this segment was the first to feel the effect of the pandemic, as building operations simply shutdown. We are getting in there now as facilities open up and more and more building owners and tenants are looking for ways to increase their indoor air quality in their facilities and I will go a little deeper into IAQ on the next slide. Project bookings are nearly flat on a year-to-date basis, which is a pretty good recovery, considering the deep drop in bookings we had in April and May. On the right side of this page, we show RPOs by market sector. Similar to a quarter ago, all eight market sectors listed had year-over-year RPO increases, except for manufacturing/industrial, where we have just completed some major projects and are looking at reloading for additional work and we feel pretty good about that as we are in the midst of developing some good prospects in the manufacturing sector as supply chains change and we also are very strong in high tech manufacturing. Many of these projects come in pieces versus all at once into our backlog. Commercial project RPOs comprised our largest market sector at over 42% of total. This is almost a 20% increase from the year-end and it\u2019s really spurred by two things, really high-tech and data center projects. It bears repeating our industry has safe -- has adapted the safety and work protocols to keep projects progressing with the larger goal of keeping workers safe. Our protocols are working. The industry keeps working and bidding opportunities continue in pretty much all sectors and geographic markets. So I am going to take the next two page and cover on pages 13 and 14. What I am going to discuss is some markets and opportunities where -- as we move forward, we believe have some resiliency for us to operate in. And I am now going to turn to page 13. It says future effects on markets. We believe we have multiple pockets of resistance despite wider non-residential uncertainty. Let\u2019s go to first the data centers. This has only gotten stronger through the pandemic. It was strong already and our electrical, mechanical and fire protection demand across Mid-Atlantic, Pacific Northwest, Midwest and Southeast. We have done a good job here and we are one of the leaders and we have also made some strategic acquisitions, especially in the last 15 months, not only in fire protection assets, but also key electrical contractors like we did in the Midwest and also in the Southeast, which is emblematic of our BKI acquisition. And of course, we build organic capability here and build off long-term success in data center markets and we are able to build these hyperscale on time, on budget and with speed. It\u2019s important to note here that there\u2019s always changes in the data center market. Projects get redesigned. They get moved. They get delayed as they get redesigned. Other ones get accelerated. That was routine course of business outside of the pandemic and really had little to do with the pandemic, in our case. On the warehouse side, we continue to build out e-commerce supply chain and we continue to see a very strong demand and not only regular warehouses, we continue to see demand across cold storage. This is especially true for our fire protection and sprinkler work. In industrial/manufacturing, we believe we are well-positioned for electrical, mechanical opportunities and millwright opportunities, driven by the re-shoring of supply chains to the Southeast and relocation from higher cost states and sites. We do believe also that we will have additional food processing opportunities. Anecdotally, we won at least three jobs in the last four months, which would have been headed either to Mexico or overseas, that are now being built in the Southeast. On the healthcare side, we continue to see demand for our sys -- our work, electrical, mechanical, fire protection and then eventually service. Hospitals are looking to retrofit. They are looking to build new facilities and they are looking to have more flexibility in their existing facilities and build new facilities. We have grown backlog here. We expect to continue to grow and look this can be episodic, things come in and out on the big projects side. But the flip side of that is we are not doing as much service work as we have typically done in hospitals, as they deal with the impacts of COVID, long-term we expect to do more retrofit work as people will think to be more flexible we will think about it. We did a lot of work to create negative pressure environment through the pandemic in these hospitals. We expect to continue to do that. But -- and any -- and if you have a bigger casualty event, accidents, terrorist situations, if they want to be able to do positive pressure. So facilities are going to have to move between the two and that\u2019s all about airflow and the kinds of work we do. And then you are going to have to have enhanced electrical systems and communication wiring in those facilities and we are uniquely positioned to help with those and we have great relationships with some of the biggest hospital systems in the country and we have helped them through the pandemic, we have helped them build some of their new facilities in the past and we expect to do both in the future and I think you are starting to see the impact of that in our backlog. On the water and wastewater side, this we think is a good long-term market for us, especially in Florida and really there they are looking for comprehensive construction services. And in water and wastewater, many times we serve as a prime contractor, bringing all trades and activities together. Mechanical services, we believe has been a good market for us for a long, long time. We have a terrific business. Most of it rests in Building Services. Some of our service operations rest in our Mechanical Construction segment and you can see that in our 10-Q. We see growing demand stepping from maintenance deferrals. We think there\u2019s going to be a lot of retrofit opportunities, I want to cover both that and indoor air quality as we switch to page 14. EMCOR has been a leader for a long time, as you look at block one, of HVAC capabilities. HVAC is a big part of our business and it can be up to a third or more of what we do in any given year. If you look at it, we do new construction, of course, we can, we can do big work. We talked about that on some of those resilient markets on the page before, core, tenant fit-out. We are a great retrofit company. We know how to do the energy retrofit work. We know how to engineer that energy retrofit work and we know how to support and help all the ESCOs that are doing that energy retrofit work. That\u2019s equipment replacement, energy retrofit, lighting upgrade, building control systems. One of the things maybe we don\u2019t brag about enough is a capability that we have in that aftermarket of HVAC. We are the leader there and we are the largest independent controller\u2019s contractor on top of everything else. And really what we seek to get to is building wellness, have the most efficient building a place that\u2019s healthy. Now, as you move to block two, indoor air quality, let\u2019s think about this at a high level. Really the goal over the last 20 years, and I have seen this from an OEM, I have seen it from a service perspective. I have seen it from a new construction perspective. Has been to take outside air out of the building, outside air is inefficient, right, in the summer with humidity, it causes efficiency problem. In the winter, it causes the same, for obvious reasons. And so we have worked real hard to take outside air out. That all went by the wayside in the middle of March. Now we are opening up air dampers that haven\u2019t been open in a long time and actually buildings are going back to 25 CFM per person and that\u2019s cubic feet per minute, and we had got that down to 15 CFM. And we have safe and productive ways to do that like demand control ventilation. So what are we doing now on indoor air quality? Well, a lot of it is, hey, you got to give people peace of mind and you as an owner have to do everything possible to increase the wellness and indoor air quality of your building. So, how do you do that? You do that through enhanced filtration. We take things from merc 10 or 12 up to merc 14 or 15. You do that through UV lamp technology that gets better and better and this stuff actually works. It reduces surface decontamination and it increases airborne inactivation, right? So, things pass through the coil, pass across the air handler media and as a result you make it cleaner. Needlepoint bipolar ionization, we are one of the leaders in the implementation of that technology. And as I talked about earlier, we spend a lot of time training on this all the way down through our technicians during the lockdown and the pandemic and we were ready to go. This is a recent case study here. This is somewhat has 240 buildings mainly a small packaged equipment. So here you have to attack it by getting into the mixing box. And how do you do that? You do that through UV because what you are trying to do is get the surface contamination gone through UV lights. We will do this across 240 we do this 90 sites. The goal is to demonstrate to the employees and actually have it happen and the indoor air quality gets better. This was a large multi-state corporation with lots of sites, and I\u2019d given a number that we thought it would be like a good medium-sized project. This is actually much better than we thought it was going to be. It\u2019s hard to quantify exactly what it will be. But it\u2019s something we can get in front of our customers with and help them drive productivity in their buildings by giving them a better workspace. Now one of the things you have to think about is indoor air quality and efficiency work across purposes with each other. I personally believe we have already had a good retrofit market. That retrofit market is going to gain strength as we move through 2021 on the HVAC side. And again, EMCOR being the largest independent air conditioning contractor, with a great retrofit capability will clearly be in a position to help our customers balance indoor air quality against efficiency. With that, I am going to turn to the last two pages 15 and 16, and I am going to close out here. Clearly, we have done much better than we expected when we withdrew guidance in April and then when we reinstated guidance with our second quarter earnings announcement, both of which we believe were the right thing to do. Today we are raising our guidance for earnings per share from continuing operations. We will move to $5.90 to $6.10 non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share and revenues of around $8.7 billion. In providing this revised guidance, we have assumed the following operating environment. First, we remain an essential service in most cases; second, we continue to execute productively in this environment; third, there are no significant shutdowns like we saw in March and April and for us that means our sites, our projects, our crafts; four, we expect to have continued strong performance from our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments, Building Services in the U.K. We still see pretty good opportunities that we are estimating in bidding and to-date, we have seen no significant project deferrals outside of oil and gas, as Mark described it. And all-in-all, non-residential market may move downward in the fourth quarter or continue to sort of be mixed, we do expect that decline to be in the mid-single-digits as we move into 2021. This is still a big market and if you refer back to page 13, we have a lot of operating space in what we believe are resilient markets. For Industrial Services, which is downstream, refining and petrochemical for the most part, we do expect sequential improvement as we go from Q3 to Q4, but nothing significant for the balance of the year. And as of today, we do expect the first quarter of 2021 to be better than the fourth quarter of 2020. We have some visibility, not as much as we would typically have at this time. However, we do not expect any significant contribution from this segment for the balance of the year. Where we end up in this range now is largely a factor of job timing, completion and service demand. As far as capital allocation, we will continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and then we do expect to return to some level of share repurchase activity in the next few quarters. We expect to continue to be a balanced capital allocator. What I am really excited about is we are rebuilding our pipeline of potential acquisitions and expect to start executing that pipeline in early 2021. We expect those acquisitions to be similar to the acquisitions that we executed from 2018 to 2020, which really was a terrific period for us to grow our company through acquisition. We certainly have the balance sheet to support such growth in our company and we again expect to remain balanced capital allocators. Lara, with that, I will turn it over to you and take questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please.\nBrent Thielman: Hey. Great. Thanks. Good morning. Congrats on a great quarter.\nTony Guzzi: Good morning, Brent.\nBrent Thielman: Tony, appreciate all the color on slide 13, interesting to kind of run through all those markets. Some of these seem like pretty sort of specialized kind of highly technical areas and I am wondering as these get larger for you, if these particular areas provide larger margin opportunities to the company, of course, assuming you execute on these appropriately?\nTony Guzzi: Yeah. I mean, with -- some of these markets you are in, you are working with a customer on budget, you are doing fee-based jobs. You are balancing speed against execution. A lot of times you are working against the budget. Brent, our margins are pretty good right now and that\u2019s mainly coming from productivity, not pricing. So I am always hesitant to get too excited about commenting on, well, that\u2019s a great margin area. Now, as you go to the smaller work, clearly, when you bring IAQ solutions and other things, but they are repair service and so a lot of time it\u2019s time and material and a lot of times it\u2019s small ticket items with high impact. So sometimes they can have a little higher margin, but you are very specialized in what you are doing there. So you look back having the kind of capability we have technically allows us to perform the way we have.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. And Tony, is it fair to say that the $500 million odd bump in RPOs, I mean, it\u2019s really mostly related to these markets or are there other things that are benefiting you there?\nTony Guzzi: No. It\u2019s mostly these markets and we don\u2019t think, even though we are down in manufacturing, we like to look at that as a good long-term market for us too. And it\u2019s always important, when the food process jobs come in or sometimes a high-tech job comes in, they come in in a lump. But even the high-tech jobs can come in in pieces, as we develop the project and a lot of the manufacturing moves where people are re-shoring or building out capability, they tend to come in pieces and so they never cause a big bump in our RPOs.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. Great. And then on the Industrial Services business over the near term, obviously, you had tough environment. I am curious, I guess, two-part question, Tony, if the hurricanes and some of the storm activity we have been seeing has created any some near-term CapEx, repair work. And then, I guess, your thoughts into the business as we move into 2021, generally speaking?\nTony Guzzi: Look, I will answer the one and I want Mark to kick in on some of the dynamics that happen on the cost side with the hurricanes. But, yeah, surely, I don\u2019t think they have caused really a lot of opportunity for us in the near-term. They did cause disruption and Mark will get into that in a second. And as we move into 2021, I mean, I think, it\u2019s tied to the pandemic, right, and the resumption of travel. Right now what\u2019s happening is crack spreads are actually okay. The issue is capacity utilization. And about 7% to 9% depending on depending on this mix is ZA [ph]. ZA is now being dumped back into diesel and that\u2019s really affecting the profitability because that incremental barrel, right, that incremental volume coming out of refinery is where they really make the margins, no matter what that product is. So utilization has to come up and then I think they will start spending money again. Mark?\nMark Pompa: Brent, with regards to build on what Tony just said and specific to the performance in the quarter, unfortunately, the disruption related to the storms wasn\u2019t just as simple of us not executing work and generating revenue. We obviously had our work crews mobilized to execute against a maintenance plan that didn\u2019t happen. So there\u2019s a fair amount of cost that was incurred during the quarter that clearly we did not generate any revenues or profits from. We were not unable to release that labor in multiple situations, because we were asked to keep them on standby in case that we were asked to assist in any of the assessment or recovery activities. So specific to the question about capital opportunities as a result of storm damage, certainly the opportunity is there, but we are with most of our customers still in the assessment phase and hopefully there will be some opportunities for us, albeit it\u2019s unfortunate at the expense of the storm damage disrupting both our customers and all the residents in that Gulf Coast region, which -- last night\u2019s storm was the fifth named storm that hit in the 2020 hurricane season. So it\u2019s really unfortunate. On top of everything else that\u2019s been unfortunate in calendar 2020.\nTony Guzzi: And we are following the same path.\nBrent Thielman: Yeah. Okay. I will pass it on. Thank you, guys.\nTony Guzzi: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from the line of Sean Eastman from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now line. Go ahead, please.\nSean Eastman: Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. Compliments to the fields, really impressive, would never know there\u2019s a pandemic going on, so nice work. I guess, firstly for me, I appreciated all the color around the pockets of resilient demand and you can certainly make a strong argument that EME can sort of outperform the broader non-res trajectory in the coming years. But we are hearing from multiple peers about a slower decision-making, deferred starts, things just slow to move across the finish line. So I just wonder how you would characterize risk of seeing an air pocket into early next year around that dynamic, whether that\u2019s something you think we should have kind of reflected in our estimates, just given the uncertainty in the macro and around the election.\nTony Guzzi: Sean, your specific question was on project delays and deferrals?\nSean Eastman: Yeah. Just characterize the level of risk, decision-making slows down and we do see deferrals even in these end markets where there is resilient demand drivers?\nTony Guzzi: So, as of today -- I speak about what I know, right? As of today, once we got through the oil and gas issues in March, which is a very different market and most of that works on time and material anyway, so they can turn them off relatively quickly. As of today, we see nothing abnormal in delays, deferrals or anything else. We have not experienced. We have a different book of business probably than a couple of our peers. We are well-constituted in several, many data center markets. We don\u2019t look at the decision-making around one data center or two data centers with the amount of work we are doing, as anything other than routine course of business. These things shift around, they move around, the designs change, this is all about capacity planning in a region the way we think about it. Secondarily, we work on projects over a long period of time, and as of today, all of the significant projects that we have been working on are continuing to advance. We did have one small project change, which actually worked to our benefit, because of a re-shoring issue that happened with one of our customers. We are talking to a lot of people about that right now and we are also talking to folks about healthcare opportunities. Now, when we get to the election, the reality -- the good thing about being my age now is, I have now worked under Republican administrations as a senior business executive for a long time and I have worked under Democratic administrations. I may have my personal views about that. But from a business standpoint, the things that we do tend to need to get done, whether the Democrats are in-charge or the Republicans are in-charge. People are going to need the kinds of things we talked about on page 13. And then, we will say, oh, we are going to get a big infrastructure bill because the Democrats are in-charge, and of course, that was the great hope when the Republicans are in-charge. Eventually something will happen there, maybe. But at the end of the day, people are still going to build things. They are still going to build things in the markets that we are really good at. We are still going to do mechanical service on buildings. We are still going to retrofit buildings. We now have this influx of IAQ work. We have this markets we are able to pivot to and participate more in, either by building organic capability or through acquisition, like we have done in data centers and healthcare, and then we also have businesses we can build out, whether it be low voltage, which we already are a market leader, but we would like to build that out. We continue to build on our controls footprint. And so, it\u2019s sort of three yards and a cloud of dust here and once in a while, we take the top off the defense and do really well.\nSean Eastman: That\u2019s really helpful. I appreciate it, Tony. And it\u2019s been a long call so I will leave it there and pass it along.\nTony Guzzi: Thank you, Sean. Thanks for following us.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have another question on the phone line coming from Noelle Dilts from Stifel. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please.\nNoelle Dilts: Hi, guys, and congratulations on a great quarter.\nTony Guzzi: Thank you.\nNoelle Dilts: I was hoping you could just comment on, just given the environment, it does sound like maybe some of the smaller contractors might be facing more challenges than you are. So, one, curious how you think that might affects consolidation opportunities in the industry. And more importantly, just kind of how you are thinking about potential M&A targets, what you are seeing in terms of pricing and what would be interesting to you in the current environment?\nTony Guzzi: Yeah. I think, Noelle, if you took our acquisitions from the last three years, lay them on a piece of paper. You see we have spent over $400 million. We brought some terrific capability and terrific teams into our company. And I think that would be look -- and I think, got it, probably, 13 acquisitions, Mark, something like that, big and small. And I think we would look to execute the same way and our pipeline was really good going into the pandemic. We were able to complete the acquisition in D.C., because we have a lot of it done. We have other things teed up. And where I would think that we would emphasize is really four or five areas. One is we still, despite as big as we are, think we can still play a role in building more capabilities for geography. Good successful electrical or mechanical contractors in markets where we are not, we would look to acquire. And usually they bring broad, what the kinds of companies we look in different geography, we look for companies that are like ours. The best of what they do. They have the ability to do a lot of different things and they can flex between markets in their local market -- end markets between their local markets. And we have several that we are talking to and our discussion is a sort of pandemic independent. It may slow down our discussion. But -- we know who they are and they know who we are and a lot of times where someone is selling their life work to us and they tend to work for us and they tend to work for us for a long time. It\u2019s been a recipe for great success for us. I think the electrical, mechanical contractors, you saw what we did in the Southeast and the Midwest back in 2019. We would look to do that again as far as capability and good markets. I think the second thing is, we will always look to add mechanical service capability. Now they can take a different flavor, sometimes we buy a large company that has a bigger platform in a market. Other times we have our platform and we look to expand around that geographically to build capability. A lot of ways that\u2019s how we got, that is how we build our very successful California company, Mesa, over a long period of time where it\u2019s clearly the market leader in mechanical service that was done through organic growth, that was done through opening branch offices with a great management team, having great labor management and then it was also done through selective small acquisitions. And we look to do that in other places or we build a beachhead in a market and then expand from there. And really the aisle on that is to be able to offer a full range of services and that we can on the mechanical basis. And then I think the final way we would look at it is, we always are looking up for good fire protection assets. We have two really great platform companies. They grow great organically and we look to adding capability where appropriate. So they would be the places that we would look to acquire. I think for us the sort of $10 million, $50 million, $100 million even $200 million deal was a place we operate really well in. The $10 million obviously gets absorbed into a larger entity, whereas the $50 million acquisition price or so becomes a standalone entity for us in a market, and of course, the $200 million plus deal really becomes a market leader for us in an environment. So it\u2019s all sort of all of the above. Now how does this affect it? I think anytime you have a big dislocation, what we see is that people reevaluate where they are. And if they thought they had a five-year window, they may accelerate that forward a little bit and say, well, maybe I should start thinking about this now. As far as pricing, if you are buying a good company, they cost what they cost. We tend not to get too far ahead of ourselves in pricing. We are certainly not competitive with private equity. I mean, they are much smarter than we are about how to run these companies. So we wouldn\u2019t dare compete with them on that.\nNoelle Dilts: Okay. Thanks for that. It\u2019s great color. I guess the second question -- again, I appreciate the detail you provided on slide 13 and 14. That\u2019s really helpful. Is there a way that you could help us, like, look at your backlog, and say, look at that piece that\u2019s commercial and understand how much of that work might be in those verticals that are a little bit more resilient? And I guess, I am just kind of trying to bridge how to think about those markets that you believe are a bit more insulated and the work you currently have in backlog?\nTony Guzzi: Yeah. I mean, we don\u2019t break it out. We have broken out to a lot of detail now. I mean, you will have a ton of detail on what we do. We are pretty protective of how much we are doing in some of those markets. Our customers appreciate that and we certainly don\u2019t want to let our competitors know where we are that successful or not.\nNoelle Dilts: Okay.\nMark Pompa: I think that was a large market. Just to interject there, obviously, it\u2019s in our disclosed RPO balance. Those are signed contracts. And just to build on what Tony said earlier, it\u2019s very unusual for us once we actually sign a contract or a project that that project actually doesn\u2019t happen, so.\nNoelle Dilts: Okay.\nTony Guzzi: But like I commented, Noelle, I mean, what you are really trying to drive out I think is, what do we do in high-tech and data centers within the Commercial segment. I did comment that the growth in that segment is coming from those markets.\nNoelle Dilts: Okay. Great. I think that\u2019s it for me. Thank you.\nTony Guzzi: Thank you very much, Noelle.\nOperator: Thank you. And as there are no further questions on the line, I would now like to turn the call over back to Mr. Tony Guzzi for closing remarks.\nTony Guzzi: Yeah. I am going to finish and I made this comment when we were talking. I think for this leadership team around this table and for clearly our people at the segment level, we are absolutely humbled by how well our organization has responded to this crisis. And we thank our employees and our leadership in the field for keeping focus on the task at hand and keeping our employees safe. We are going to do everything we can to keep doing that. We will get through this next phase of whatever we are in right now with this pandemic and hopefully come out here in the first quarter with solutions to this problem. Thank you all very much, and I guess, we won\u2019t talk to you until the New Year. Be well.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Thank you so much presenters. And again, thank you everyone for participating. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect. Stay safe and have a lovely day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Pompa",
            "content": "Thank you, Tony, and good morning to everyone participating on today's call. For those accessing this presentation via the webcast we are now on slide seven. Over the next several slides, I will augment Tony's opening commentary and EMCOR's third quarter performance, as well as provide an update on our year-to-date results through September 30. All financial information referenced is derived from a consolidated financial statements, included in both our earnings release announcement and Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this morning. So let's revisit and expand our review of EMCOR's third quarter performance. Consolidated revenues of $2.2 billion, are down $86 million or 3.8% from quarter three 2019. Our third quarter results include $81.4 million of revenues attributable to businesses acquired, pertaining to the time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in last year's third quarter. Acquisition revenues positively impacted both our United States Mechanical Construction and United States Building Services segments. Excluding the impacted businesses acquired, third quarter consolidated revenues decreased approximately $167.5 million or 7.3%. Unlike our results for the second quarter of 2020 where each of our reportable segments had quarter-over-quarter revenue declines, we did see revenue gains in three of our five segments during the third quarter of this year. However, when you remove the impact of businesses acquired, all of our U.S. reportable segments experienced organic revenue declines period-over-period, as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the disruption within the oil and gas markets are still impacting a number of our businesses. United States Electrical Construction revenues of $508.9 million decreased $45.8 million or 8.3% from 2019's third quarter. Revenue declined across multiple market sectors due to the continuing impact of the pandemic, including the associated containment and mitigation measures, as well as the curtailment of certain capital spending by some of our customers. This segment additionally experienced a significant reduction in revenues within the manufacturing or industrial market sector, where certain of our electrical businesses perform services for both midstream and upstream oil and gas customers. Not dissimilar to our Industrial Services segment, the Electrical Construction segment has experienced numerous project deferrals, specifically in the manufacturing and industrial market sector resulting from cost control actions initiated by many of their customers within the broader oil and gas industry. United States Mechanical Construction segment revenues of $891.5 million, increased $22.3 million or 2.6% from quarter three of 2019. The results of the segment represent record third quarter revenue performance. Excluding acquisition revenues of $61.1 million, the segment's revenues decreased $38.8 million or 4.5% organically. Reductions in quarter-over-quarter revenues from the manufacturing market sector, inclusive of activities within the food processing submarket sector, as well as the healthcare market sector due to project completions in the prior year are the primary reasons for this segment's organic revenue decline. EMCOR's total Domestic Construction business third quarter revenues of $1.4 billion, decreased by $23.5 million or 1.6%. United States Building Services quarterly revenues of $551.5 million, increased $19.4 million or 3.7% and represents an all-time quarterly record for this segment. Excluding acquisition revenues of $20.3 million, this segment's revenues decreased approximately $900,000 or less than 0.75%. Reduced building control project activities due to access restrictions created by the COVID-19 pandemic were almost entirely offset by increased small project revenues, including indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity project volume from this segment's Government Services division, as well as an increase in demand for certain services aimed at improving indoor air quality in response to the pandemic and in line with the recommendations from the CDC. Tony will comment further on our IAQ capabilities later in his presentation. United States Industrial Services revenues of $139.7 million, decreased $94.4 million or 40.3%, as this segment continues to be impacted by the negative macroeconomic conditions and uncertainty within the markets in which it operates. Additionally, our quarterly performance within this segment was adversely affected by work stoppages resulting from hurricane and tropical storm activity in the Gulf Coast region, where the majority of our Industrial Services operations are located. United Kingdom Building Services segment revenues of $110.1 million, increased $12.5 million or 12.7% from last year's quarter. Revenue gains for the quarter resulted from new maintenance contract awards, as well as strong project activity across our customer portfolio. In addition, revenues of this segment were positively impacted by $5 million, as a result of favorable foreign exchange rate movements within the quarter. Please turn to slide eight. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $226.8 million represent 10.3% of third quarter revenues and reflect an increase of $6.7 million. The current year's quarter includes approximately $8.9 million of incremental expenses from businesses acquired, inclusive of intangible asset amortization, resulting in an organic quarter-over-quarter decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately $2.2 million. SG&A expenses for the third quarter of 2019 were favorably impacted by $4.5 million of insurance recovery and legal settlements within the Industrial Services segment. When excluding these recoveries from the prior year period, the adjusted organic decline in 2020's third quarter SG&A is $6.7 million. Quarter-over-quarter reductions in salaries and travel and entertainment expenses due to a combination of cost-cutting measures and the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic were partially offset by an increase in quarterly incentive compensation expense due to EMCOR's improved operating performance during the period and our revised upward expectations for full year 2020. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of revenues is due to the reduction in quarterly consolidated revenues without a commensurate decrease in certain of our fixed overhead cost as we do not deem the current operating environment to be permanent. This is consistent with our assessment during this year's second quarter. Additionally, with quarter-over-quarter and sequential increase in total incentive compensation expense previously mentioned, our SG&A as a percentage of revenues was unfavorably impacted by approximately 50 basis points within the third quarter of 2020. Reported operating income for the quarter of $135.9 million represented $20.1 million increase or 17.4%, as compared to operating income of $115.7 million in 2019's third quarter. This represents an all-time quarterly operating income record for EMCOR, which is quite remarkable performance when you consider the economic backdrop. Our third quarter operating margin of 6.2%, which favorably compares to the 5.1% of operating margin reported in last year's third quarter. We experienced operating margin expansion within each of our reportable segments other than our U.S. Industrial Services segment, which is reporting an operating loss for the quarter and our U.K. Building Services segment, which was essentially flat period-over-period. Specific quarterly performance by reporting segments is as follows, our U.S. Electrical Construction segment operating income of $47.1 million increased $13.4 million from the comparable 2019 period. Reported operating margin of 9.2% represents a 310-basis-point improvement over last year's third quarter. This improvement in both operating income dollars and operating margin is largely attributable to increased gross profit contribution from commercial market sector activities, inclusive of numerous telecommunication construction projects. In addition, operating income and operating margin of this segment benefited from favorable project closeouts within the transportation and institutional market sectors, which positively impacted quarterly operating margin in the current year by 70 basis points. Third quarter operating income of our U.S. Mechanical Construction services segment of $80 million represents an $18.8 million increase from last year's quarter, while operating margin in the quarter of 9% represents a 200-basis-point improvement over 2019. Despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, this segment has experienced increased gross profit from projects within the majority of the market sectors in which it operates. In addition, a more favorable mix of work within the both -- within both the manufacturing and the commercial market sectors drove the improvement in quarterly operating margin. Our combined U.S. Construction business is reporting a 9.1% operating margin and $127.1 million of operating income, which has increased from 2019's third quarter by $32.3 million or 34%. For the third quarter of 2020, operating income and operating margin for our U.S. Building Services segment was $38.2 million and 6.9%, respectively. The performance of this segment represents an all-time quarterly record in terms of both operating income and operating margin. Operating income increased by $3.2 million over last year's third quarter and operating margin improved by 30 basis points. These increases were primarily due to increased gross profit and gross profit margin from this segment's commercial site-based services division. In addition, this segment's results for the current quarter, benefited from lower selling, general and administrative expenses, due to cost-cutting measures enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our U.S. Industrial Services operating loss of $9.8 million represents a decrease of $15.4 million, compared to operating income of $5.6 million in last year's third quarter. As briefly mentioned earlier on this call, as well as during my commentary on our second quarter earnings call, this segment has been significantly impacted by adverse macroeconomic conditions within the oil and gas industry, as well as the dramatic decline in demand for refined oil products due to the travel restrictions and other containment and mitigation measures imposed in response to COVID-19. These conditions have resulted in reduced capital spending and the implementation of various cost-cutting measures by certain of our customers, which has resulted in a decrease in demand for the services provided by this segment. Compounding this reduced demand and as a -- and as I referenced during my revenue commentary, the Gulf Coast region has been impacted by numerous named storms during 2020's hurricane season, which resulted in the suspension of planned maintenance activities as our customers focused on storm preparation and recovery efforts. U.K. Building Services operating income of $5.3 million represents an approximately $600,000 increase over 2019's third quarter due to an increase in gross profit within this segment. Operating margin of 4.8% is slightly reduced from 2019's third quarter operating margin of 4.9%. We are now on slide nine. Additional financial items of significance for the quarter not addressed on my previous slides are as follows, quarter three gross profit of $363.2 million or 16.5% of revenues has improved over last year's quarter by $27.2 million and 180 basis points of gross margin. We experienced quarter-over-quarter improvement in gross profit dollars in all reportable segments other than our Industrial Services segment due to the unfavorable market conditions previously outlined. Diluted earnings per common share of $1.11, compares to $1.45 per diluted share in last year's third quarter. Adjusting our record quarterly performance for the negative impact on our income tax rate resulting from the non-deductible portion of the non-cash impairment charges recorded during the second quarter of this year, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2020, is $1.76, which favorably compares to last year's quarter by $0.31 or 21.4%. My last comment on this slide is a continuation of my income tax rate commentary, which as you can see on the bottom of slide nine is 54.7% for the quarter due to the non-deductibility of the majority of quarter two's non-cash impairment charges. With one quarter of 2020 remaining, I anticipate that our full year tax rate will be between 53% and 54%, which is a downward revision from the previous range provided on our quarter two call. As everyone on this call knows, this range can change, if we have any significant discrete tax items that occur during the fourth quarter. Please turn to slide 10. With my quarter commentary complete, let's now turn our attention to EMCOR's year-to-date results through September 30th. Revenues of $6.52 billion represent a decrease of $255.1 million or 3.8% when compared to revenues of $6.77 billion in the corresponding prior year period. Our year-to-date results include $214.1 million of revenues attributable to businesses acquired, pertaining to the period of time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in the 2019 year-to-date period. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired, year-to-date revenues decreased organically 6.9%, primarily as a result of the significant revenue contraction experienced during quarter two, given the containment and mitigation measures mandated by certain of our customers, as well as numerous governmental authorities in response to COVID-19. Year-to-date gross profit of $1 billion is higher than the 2019 nine-month period by $20.4 million or 2.1%. Year-to-date gross margin is 15.5%, which favorably compares to 2019's year-to-date gross margin of 14.6%. The year-over-year gross margin improvement was largely driven by our combined U.S. Construction business. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $659 million represent 10.1% of revenues, as compared to $652.5 million or 9.6% of revenues in the prior year period. Year-to-date 2020 includes $25.2 million of incremental SG&A, inclusive of intangible asset amortization pertaining to businesses acquired. Excluding such incremental costs, our SG&A has decreased on an organic basis by approximately $18.7 million year-over-year. Reported operating income for the first nine months of 2020 is $119.2 million. Adjusting this amount to exclude the non-cash impairment loss on goodwill, identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets recorded in the second quarter results in non-GAAP operating income of $352 million for 2020's nine-month period, as compared to $338 million for the corresponding 2019 year-to-date period. This adjusted non-GAAP operating income represents a $13.9 million or 4.1% improvement year-over-year. Diluted earnings per common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, is $0.96. When adjusting this amount for the impact of the non-cash impairment charges previously mentioned, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $4.54, as compared to $4.22 in last year's nine-month period. This represents a $0.32 or 7.6% improvement period-over-period. We are now on slide 11. EMCOR's liquidity profile continues to improve as we just completed another quarter of strong cash flow generation, bringing our year-to-date operating cash flow to $546.8 million. Our operating cash flow has benefited from the effective management of working capital by our subsidiary leadership teams, coupled with the impact of certain government measures enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which allow for the deferral of the employer's portion of social security tax payments and the remission of value-added tax for our U.K. subsidiary. On a year-to-date basis, these measures have favorably impacted operating cash flow by approximately $81 million. With this strong operating cash flow, cash on hand has increased to $679.3 million from the approximately $359 million on our year-end 2019 balance sheet and is the primary driver of the increase in our September 30th working capital balance. Other changes in key balance sheet positions of note are as follows, goodwill has decreased since December 31, 2019, as a result of a non-cash impairment charge recognized during the second quarter of 2020, partially offset by an increase in goodwill resulting from the businesses acquired during the year -- 2020 year-to-date period. Largely as a result of $44.8 million of amortization expense recorded during the first nine months of this year, our identifiable intangible asset balance has decreased since December 31, 2019. Similar to our goodwill balance, this decrease was partially offset by incremental intangible assets recognized, as a result of the acquisition of two businesses during the first nine months of this year. Total debt has decreased by approximately $30 million since the end of 2019, reflecting our net financing activity during the year. Although, not included on this slide due to the periods presented, EMCOR has paid down approximately $273 million of borrowings under its credit facility, inclusive of borrowings executed during 2020. EMCOR's debt to capitalization ratio has decreased to 12.3% as of September 30th. Lastly, our stockholder's equity has decreased since December 2019, as our share repurchase activity and dividend payments for the nine-month period of 2020 have exceeded our net income due to the impairment loss recognized in the second quarter. Due to our strong cash flow performance in concert with our available credit, EMCOR remains in a very strong position to take advantage of any market opportunities that may be present in future periods. With my lengthy portion of this slide presentation concluded, I would like to give the call back to Tony. Thank you. Brent, with regards to build on what Tony just said and specific to the performance in the quarter, unfortunately, the disruption related to the storms wasn't just as simple of us not executing work and generating revenue. We obviously had our work crews mobilized to execute against a maintenance plan that didn't happen. So there's a fair amount of cost that was incurred during the quarter that clearly we did not generate any revenues or profits from. We were not unable to release that labor in multiple situations, because we were asked to keep them on standby in case that we were asked to assist in any of the assessment or recovery activities. So specific to the question about capital opportunities as a result of storm damage, certainly the opportunity is there, but we are with most of our customers still in the assessment phase and hopefully there will be some opportunities for us, albeit it's unfortunate at the expense of the storm damage disrupting both our customers and all the residents in that Gulf Coast region, which -- last night's storm was the fifth named storm that hit in the 2020 hurricane season. So it's really unfortunate. On top of everything else that's been unfortunate in calendar 2020. I think that was a large market. Just to interject there, obviously, it's in our disclosed RPO balance. Those are signed contracts. And just to build on what Tony said earlier, it's very unusual for us once we actually sign a contract or a project that that project actually doesn't happen, so."

            "name": "Tony Guzzi",
            "content": "Yes. Good morning, and thanks, Kevin. I am going to start on pages four through six. We had an exceptional quarter, s reported with respect to operating income at $135.9 million, operating income percentage at 6.2% and with respect to earnings per diluted share at $1.76 on a non-GAAP adjusted basis. We earned revenues of $2.2 billion in the quarter and had operating cash flow of $270 million. We had excellent operational performance and cost control. Our team executed with focus, discipline and precision. We continue to take steps to keep our skilled trades workforce safe, motivated and productive. We achieved this performance despite a very difficult operating environment for our EMCOR Industrial Services segment, which you know, focuses on downstream, petrochemical, and oil and gas and refining. We have structurally reduced our SG&A by about $7 million to $9 million per quarter on a go-forward basis. The exceptional performance of our segments Building, Industrial Services gap thus demonstrating how the diversity and balance at EMCOR can work for our shareholders. I will cover some of the highlights by segment and I will cover the broad themes and practices that have driven our performance during these challenging times. Our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments had outstanding performance in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. We leveraged our cost structure across a solid mix of projects, returned strong and robust operating income margins of 9.2% in our Electrical Construction segment and 9.0% in our Mechanical Construction segment. We leveraged a lower cost structure, but more importantly, had exceptional field performance on our projects. We did benefit on some project closeout to resolutions. We always have some of those, something that Mark will cover in more detail. But the underlying performance and productivity in these segments is as good as we have ever had, period, full stop. Our Building -- U.S. Building Services segment performed exceptionally well, with a record quarterly operating income percentage of 6.9%. Our commercial site-based business had their best third quarter ever and resets their cost base to position us for even more success in the future as we grow the business. We have a very good customer mix. Our customers are demanding, but by involving us in their maintenance capital spending, they provide us with the opportunity to add value through incremental small projects and service activity. Our Government business also had a very good quarter. In addition, we had excellent repair service and project performance in our mobile mechanical services division. Our repair services aided by a hot summer coupled with significant demand for our IAQ or indoor air quality products and services. We also are near flat year-to-date for project bookings on an organic basis, which show significant recovery from the large drop in organic bookings in April and May. We also completed the ninth acquisition in August that will build our project capabilities and allow for long-term service growth in the Washington D.C. market. Our Industrial Services segment had a tough quarter in line with what we expected and discussed on our second quarter earnings call. Demand has dropped significantly across the industry and that coupled with successive hurricanes made for a very difficult quarter. This is a tough environment for Industrial Services as we focus on petrochemical and refining. However, we are well-positioned when our customers rebound. We have reset the business through aggressive cost cutting and redeploying personnel to the work that is available. The issue is our field supervision is absorbed and productive. However, they are capable of and what is available today and that is where the leverage is in this segment. Our U.K. segment continues to a steady performance and continues to build on a strong market position. Our strong customer relationships give us opportunities to not only meet their service needs, but also their maintenance and project retrofit needs. I want to take this opportunity to share with you how we have succeeded in this challenging operating environment across EMCOR. These actions and themes are why we have had this exceptional year-to-date performance across our business. Number one, we kept our focus as an organization. As we have moved through this ever-changing environment in 2020, we have stayed focused on accomplishing our mission for our customers. We are already a flat organization and we had direct communication at multiple levels. We became even flatter with even better communication across our company. Number two, employee safety is and has been our number one priority throughout this pandemic. Our people were able to keep this priority paramount as it is one of our core values. We just had to implement these practices in a different way. Our team knows we avoid shortcuts and we always emphasize worker safety. This unrelenting focus and commitment to safety is not new to us. It is one of the main reasons we can fill the best team in the industry. Number three, we work together across this large decentralized organization by focusing on the task at hand and we have sought to comply at all times with a multitude of regulations, programs and procedures in this constantly changing environment. Our staff has made sure that our subsidiaries had the best available information to implement the practices needed to keep progress moving on a project or a service demand. Again, teamwork and mutual respect for each other are core values of EMCOR. Number four, we stayed focused not only on safety but also productivity. Our people took ownership of job sites, brought solutions forward that allowed us to at least maintain the productivity we bid in the jobs through better scheduling, adjusted work practices, more prefabrication and better job site logistics. In many ways, we were uniquely trained to perform in this constantly changing environment. We are a team of very successful trade contractors, who know how to react and adapt to changing markets and job site conditions. Number five, we have positioned ourselves into some good term -- long-term markets, which I will talk about later, such as healthcare manufacturing, high-tech manufacturing, data centers, commercial and food processing. We offer valuable services in these markets through our electrical trades, our HVAC technicians, our pipefitters, welders, millwrights, sprinkler fitters and plumbers. We are able to move between markets with skill and agility that can handle the most complex construction and service opportunities within these markets. Number six, we were prepared and trained to serve our customers with new products when the pandemic hit. We bundled together our services and products related to IAQ/indoor air quality and building wellness, and had these solutions ready to present to our customers when we were able to reenter buildings, campuses and industrial facilities. We have helped and continue to help our customers reopen with more peace of mind, by improving the airflow and air quality in their workplaces. Number seven, we became leaner and more productive. We cut costs early and deep in some of our businesses. We did not wait to react. We found new ways to work through technology. And finally number eight, we leveraged our scale, our suppliers worked with us to make sure we had the necessary personal protective equipment necessary for our people to do their jobs. We had the job materials we needed to be successful, despite supply disruptions that may have impacted others. We shared ideas on how to keep safe but also stay productive. For me, it's been humbling to see this high level of execution during these difficult times. It speaks to the leadership of our segment and subsidiary leaders who look for solution when obstacles are in front of them. And our highly skilled and dedicated workforce who continued to work and serve our customers throughout these difficult times driven by this pandemic. I cannot thank them enough for all that they do for EMCOR every day, our customers and our shareholders. And with that, Mark, I will turn it to you. Thanks, Mark. And that's what happens when we are in the third quarter, right? Thank you. And I am going to be on page 12, remaining performance obligations by segment and market sector. Total RPOs at the end of the third quarter were a little over $4.5 billion, up $495 million or 12.3% when compared to the September 2019 level of $4 billion. RPOs likewise increased the same amount $494 million for the first nine months of 2020, with all of this growth being organic except for approximately $86 million relating to two acquisitions in the current 12-month period. Taken together, our Mechanical and Electrical Construction segment RPOs have increased $409 million or 12.4% since the year ago period, 7% of this growth is organic with the balance being RPOs that came with our November \u201819 acquisition of BKI, a full service mechanical contractor headquartered in the Atlanta area. I should note here that thus far in 2020, BKI has more than doubled its RPOs total in the first nine months of this year, as they continue to win work, including projects in the data center, manufacturing and healthcare markets. The integration of BKI has gone very well due to the exceptional team they have. They really are a terrific team so we are thrilled to have them on our team. Building Services segment RPOs increased in the quarter as this segment's small project, repair service work also continues to regain its footing. Remember the small project work in this segment was the first to feel the effect of the pandemic, as building operations simply shutdown. We are getting in there now as facilities open up and more and more building owners and tenants are looking for ways to increase their indoor air quality in their facilities and I will go a little deeper into IAQ on the next slide. Project bookings are nearly flat on a year-to-date basis, which is a pretty good recovery, considering the deep drop in bookings we had in April and May. On the right side of this page, we show RPOs by market sector. Similar to a quarter ago, all eight market sectors listed had year-over-year RPO increases, except for manufacturing/industrial, where we have just completed some major projects and are looking at reloading for additional work and we feel pretty good about that as we are in the midst of developing some good prospects in the manufacturing sector as supply chains change and we also are very strong in high tech manufacturing. Many of these projects come in pieces versus all at once into our backlog. Commercial project RPOs comprised our largest market sector at over 42% of total. This is almost a 20% increase from the year-end and it's really spurred by two things, really high-tech and data center projects. It bears repeating our industry has safe -- has adapted the safety and work protocols to keep projects progressing with the larger goal of keeping workers safe. Our protocols are working. The industry keeps working and bidding opportunities continue in pretty much all sectors and geographic markets. So I am going to take the next two page and cover on pages 13 and 14. What I am going to discuss is some markets and opportunities where -- as we move forward, we believe have some resiliency for us to operate in. And I am now going to turn to page 13. It says future effects on markets. We believe we have multiple pockets of resistance despite wider non-residential uncertainty. Let's go to first the data centers. This has only gotten stronger through the pandemic. It was strong already and our electrical, mechanical and fire protection demand across Mid-Atlantic, Pacific Northwest, Midwest and Southeast. We have done a good job here and we are one of the leaders and we have also made some strategic acquisitions, especially in the last 15 months, not only in fire protection assets, but also key electrical contractors like we did in the Midwest and also in the Southeast, which is emblematic of our BKI acquisition. And of course, we build organic capability here and build off long-term success in data center markets and we are able to build these hyperscale on time, on budget and with speed. It's important to note here that there's always changes in the data center market. Projects get redesigned. They get moved. They get delayed as they get redesigned. Other ones get accelerated. That was routine course of business outside of the pandemic and really had little to do with the pandemic, in our case. On the warehouse side, we continue to build out e-commerce supply chain and we continue to see a very strong demand and not only regular warehouses, we continue to see demand across cold storage. This is especially true for our fire protection and sprinkler work. In industrial/manufacturing, we believe we are well-positioned for electrical, mechanical opportunities and millwright opportunities, driven by the re-shoring of supply chains to the Southeast and relocation from higher cost states and sites. We do believe also that we will have additional food processing opportunities. Anecdotally, we won at least three jobs in the last four months, which would have been headed either to Mexico or overseas, that are now being built in the Southeast. On the healthcare side, we continue to see demand for our sys -- our work, electrical, mechanical, fire protection and then eventually service. Hospitals are looking to retrofit. They are looking to build new facilities and they are looking to have more flexibility in their existing facilities and build new facilities. We have grown backlog here. We expect to continue to grow and look this can be episodic, things come in and out on the big projects side. But the flip side of that is we are not doing as much service work as we have typically done in hospitals, as they deal with the impacts of COVID, long-term we expect to do more retrofit work as people will think to be more flexible we will think about it. We did a lot of work to create negative pressure environment through the pandemic in these hospitals. We expect to continue to do that. But -- and any -- and if you have a bigger casualty event, accidents, terrorist situations, if they want to be able to do positive pressure. So facilities are going to have to move between the two and that's all about airflow and the kinds of work we do. And then you are going to have to have enhanced electrical systems and communication wiring in those facilities and we are uniquely positioned to help with those and we have great relationships with some of the biggest hospital systems in the country and we have helped them through the pandemic, we have helped them build some of their new facilities in the past and we expect to do both in the future and I think you are starting to see the impact of that in our backlog. On the water and wastewater side, this we think is a good long-term market for us, especially in Florida and really there they are looking for comprehensive construction services. And in water and wastewater, many times we serve as a prime contractor, bringing all trades and activities together. Mechanical services, we believe has been a good market for us for a long, long time. We have a terrific business. Most of it rests in Building Services. Some of our service operations rest in our Mechanical Construction segment and you can see that in our 10-Q. We see growing demand stepping from maintenance deferrals. We think there's going to be a lot of retrofit opportunities, I want to cover both that and indoor air quality as we switch to page 14. EMCOR has been a leader for a long time, as you look at block one, of HVAC capabilities. HVAC is a big part of our business and it can be up to a third or more of what we do in any given year. If you look at it, we do new construction, of course, we can, we can do big work. We talked about that on some of those resilient markets on the page before, core, tenant fit-out. We are a great retrofit company. We know how to do the energy retrofit work. We know how to engineer that energy retrofit work and we know how to support and help all the ESCOs that are doing that energy retrofit work. That's equipment replacement, energy retrofit, lighting upgrade, building control systems. One of the things maybe we don't brag about enough is a capability that we have in that aftermarket of HVAC. We are the leader there and we are the largest independent controller's contractor on top of everything else. And really what we seek to get to is building wellness, have the most efficient building a place that's healthy. Now, as you move to block two, indoor air quality, let's think about this at a high level. Really the goal over the last 20 years, and I have seen this from an OEM, I have seen it from a service perspective. I have seen it from a new construction perspective. Has been to take outside air out of the building, outside air is inefficient, right, in the summer with humidity, it causes efficiency problem. In the winter, it causes the same, for obvious reasons. And so we have worked real hard to take outside air out. That all went by the wayside in the middle of March. Now we are opening up air dampers that haven't been open in a long time and actually buildings are going back to 25 CFM per person and that's cubic feet per minute, and we had got that down to 15 CFM. And we have safe and productive ways to do that like demand control ventilation. So what are we doing now on indoor air quality? Well, a lot of it is, hey, you got to give people peace of mind and you as an owner have to do everything possible to increase the wellness and indoor air quality of your building. So, how do you do that? You do that through enhanced filtration. We take things from merc 10 or 12 up to merc 14 or 15. You do that through UV lamp technology that gets better and better and this stuff actually works. It reduces surface decontamination and it increases airborne inactivation, right? So, things pass through the coil, pass across the air handler media and as a result you make it cleaner. Needlepoint bipolar ionization, we are one of the leaders in the implementation of that technology. And as I talked about earlier, we spend a lot of time training on this all the way down through our technicians during the lockdown and the pandemic and we were ready to go. This is a recent case study here. This is somewhat has 240 buildings mainly a small packaged equipment. So here you have to attack it by getting into the mixing box. And how do you do that? You do that through UV because what you are trying to do is get the surface contamination gone through UV lights. We will do this across 240 we do this 90 sites. The goal is to demonstrate to the employees and actually have it happen and the indoor air quality gets better. This was a large multi-state corporation with lots of sites, and I'd given a number that we thought it would be like a good medium-sized project. This is actually much better than we thought it was going to be. It's hard to quantify exactly what it will be. But it's something we can get in front of our customers with and help them drive productivity in their buildings by giving them a better workspace. Now one of the things you have to think about is indoor air quality and efficiency work across purposes with each other. I personally believe we have already had a good retrofit market. That retrofit market is going to gain strength as we move through 2021 on the HVAC side. And again, EMCOR being the largest independent air conditioning contractor, with a great retrofit capability will clearly be in a position to help our customers balance indoor air quality against efficiency. With that, I am going to turn to the last two pages 15 and 16, and I am going to close out here. Clearly, we have done much better than we expected when we withdrew guidance in April and then when we reinstated guidance with our second quarter earnings announcement, both of which we believe were the right thing to do. Today we are raising our guidance for earnings per share from continuing operations. We will move to $5.90 to $6.10 non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share and revenues of around $8.7 billion. In providing this revised guidance, we have assumed the following operating environment. First, we remain an essential service in most cases; second, we continue to execute productively in this environment; third, there are no significant shutdowns like we saw in March and April and for us that means our sites, our projects, our crafts; four, we expect to have continued strong performance from our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments, Building Services in the U.K. We still see pretty good opportunities that we are estimating in bidding and to-date, we have seen no significant project deferrals outside of oil and gas, as Mark described it. And all-in-all, non-residential market may move downward in the fourth quarter or continue to sort of be mixed, we do expect that decline to be in the mid-single-digits as we move into 2021. This is still a big market and if you refer back to page 13, we have a lot of operating space in what we believe are resilient markets. For Industrial Services, which is downstream, refining and petrochemical for the most part, we do expect sequential improvement as we go from Q3 to Q4, but nothing significant for the balance of the year. And as of today, we do expect the first quarter of 2021 to be better than the fourth quarter of 2020. We have some visibility, not as much as we would typically have at this time. However, we do not expect any significant contribution from this segment for the balance of the year. Where we end up in this range now is largely a factor of job timing, completion and service demand. As far as capital allocation, we will continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and then we do expect to return to some level of share repurchase activity in the next few quarters. We expect to continue to be a balanced capital allocator. What I am really excited about is we are rebuilding our pipeline of potential acquisitions and expect to start executing that pipeline in early 2021. We expect those acquisitions to be similar to the acquisitions that we executed from 2018 to 2020, which really was a terrific period for us to grow our company through acquisition. We certainly have the balance sheet to support such growth in our company and we again expect to remain balanced capital allocators. Lara, with that, I will turn it over to you and take questions. Good morning, Brent. Yeah. I mean, with -- some of these markets you are in, you are working with a customer on budget, you are doing fee-based jobs. You are balancing speed against execution. A lot of times you are working against the budget. Brent, our margins are pretty good right now and that's mainly coming from productivity, not pricing. So I am always hesitant to get too excited about commenting on, well, that's a great margin area. Now, as you go to the smaller work, clearly, when you bring IAQ solutions and other things, but they are repair service and so a lot of time it's time and material and a lot of times it's small ticket items with high impact. So sometimes they can have a little higher margin, but you are very specialized in what you are doing there. So you look back having the kind of capability we have technically allows us to perform the way we have. No. It's mostly these markets and we don't think, even though we are down in manufacturing, we like to look at that as a good long-term market for us too. And it's always important, when the food process jobs come in or sometimes a high-tech job comes in, they come in in a lump. But even the high-tech jobs can come in in pieces, as we develop the project and a lot of the manufacturing moves where people are re-shoring or building out capability, they tend to come in pieces and so they never cause a big bump in our RPOs. Look, I will answer the one and I want Mark to kick in on some of the dynamics that happen on the cost side with the hurricanes. But, yeah, surely, I don't think they have caused really a lot of opportunity for us in the near-term. They did cause disruption and Mark will get into that in a second. And as we move into 2021, I mean, I think, it's tied to the pandemic, right, and the resumption of travel. Right now what's happening is crack spreads are actually okay. The issue is capacity utilization. And about 7% to 9% depending on depending on this mix is ZA [ph]. ZA is now being dumped back into diesel and that's really affecting the profitability because that incremental barrel, right, that incremental volume coming out of refinery is where they really make the margins, no matter what that product is. So utilization has to come up and then I think they will start spending money again. Mark? And we are following the same path. Thank you. Sean, your specific question was on project delays and deferrals? So, as of today -- I speak about what I know, right? As of today, once we got through the oil and gas issues in March, which is a very different market and most of that works on time and material anyway, so they can turn them off relatively quickly. As of today, we see nothing abnormal in delays, deferrals or anything else. We have not experienced. We have a different book of business probably than a couple of our peers. We are well-constituted in several, many data center markets. We don't look at the decision-making around one data center or two data centers with the amount of work we are doing, as anything other than routine course of business. These things shift around, they move around, the designs change, this is all about capacity planning in a region the way we think about it. Secondarily, we work on projects over a long period of time, and as of today, all of the significant projects that we have been working on are continuing to advance. We did have one small project change, which actually worked to our benefit, because of a re-shoring issue that happened with one of our customers. We are talking to a lot of people about that right now and we are also talking to folks about healthcare opportunities. Now, when we get to the election, the reality -- the good thing about being my age now is, I have now worked under Republican administrations as a senior business executive for a long time and I have worked under Democratic administrations. I may have my personal views about that. But from a business standpoint, the things that we do tend to need to get done, whether the Democrats are in-charge or the Republicans are in-charge. People are going to need the kinds of things we talked about on page 13. And then, we will say, oh, we are going to get a big infrastructure bill because the Democrats are in-charge, and of course, that was the great hope when the Republicans are in-charge. Eventually something will happen there, maybe. But at the end of the day, people are still going to build things. They are still going to build things in the markets that we are really good at. We are still going to do mechanical service on buildings. We are still going to retrofit buildings. We now have this influx of IAQ work. We have this markets we are able to pivot to and participate more in, either by building organic capability or through acquisition, like we have done in data centers and healthcare, and then we also have businesses we can build out, whether it be low voltage, which we already are a market leader, but we would like to build that out. We continue to build on our controls footprint. And so, it's sort of three yards and a cloud of dust here and once in a while, we take the top off the defense and do really well. Thank you, Sean. Thanks for following us. Thank you. Yeah. I think, Noelle, if you took our acquisitions from the last three years, lay them on a piece of paper. You see we have spent over $400 million. We brought some terrific capability and terrific teams into our company. And I think that would be look -- and I think, got it, probably, 13 acquisitions, Mark, something like that, big and small. And I think we would look to execute the same way and our pipeline was really good going into the pandemic. We were able to complete the acquisition in D.C., because we have a lot of it done. We have other things teed up. And where I would think that we would emphasize is really four or five areas. One is we still, despite as big as we are, think we can still play a role in building more capabilities for geography. Good successful electrical or mechanical contractors in markets where we are not, we would look to acquire. And usually they bring broad, what the kinds of companies we look in different geography, we look for companies that are like ours. The best of what they do. They have the ability to do a lot of different things and they can flex between markets in their local market -- end markets between their local markets. And we have several that we are talking to and our discussion is a sort of pandemic independent. It may slow down our discussion. But -- we know who they are and they know who we are and a lot of times where someone is selling their life work to us and they tend to work for us and they tend to work for us for a long time. It's been a recipe for great success for us. I think the electrical, mechanical contractors, you saw what we did in the Southeast and the Midwest back in 2019. We would look to do that again as far as capability and good markets. I think the second thing is, we will always look to add mechanical service capability. Now they can take a different flavor, sometimes we buy a large company that has a bigger platform in a market. Other times we have our platform and we look to expand around that geographically to build capability. A lot of ways that's how we got, that is how we build our very successful California company, Mesa, over a long period of time where it's clearly the market leader in mechanical service that was done through organic growth, that was done through opening branch offices with a great management team, having great labor management and then it was also done through selective small acquisitions. And we look to do that in other places or we build a beachhead in a market and then expand from there. And really the aisle on that is to be able to offer a full range of services and that we can on the mechanical basis. And then I think the final way we would look at it is, we always are looking up for good fire protection assets. We have two really great platform companies. They grow great organically and we look to adding capability where appropriate. So they would be the places that we would look to acquire. I think for us the sort of $10 million, $50 million, $100 million even $200 million deal was a place we operate really well in. The $10 million obviously gets absorbed into a larger entity, whereas the $50 million acquisition price or so becomes a standalone entity for us in a market, and of course, the $200 million plus deal really becomes a market leader for us in an environment. So it's all sort of all of the above. Now how does this affect it? I think anytime you have a big dislocation, what we see is that people reevaluate where they are. And if they thought they had a five-year window, they may accelerate that forward a little bit and say, well, maybe I should start thinking about this now. As far as pricing, if you are buying a good company, they cost what they cost. We tend not to get too far ahead of ourselves in pricing. We are certainly not competitive with private equity. I mean, they are much smarter than we are about how to run these companies. So we wouldn't dare compete with them on that. Yeah. I mean, we don't break it out. We have broken out to a lot of detail now. I mean, you will have a ton of detail on what we do. We are pretty protective of how much we are doing in some of those markets. Our customers appreciate that and we certainly don't want to let our competitors know where we are that successful or not. But like I commented, Noelle, I mean, what you are really trying to drive out I think is, what do we do in high-tech and data centers within the Commercial segment. I did comment that the growth in that segment is coming from those markets. Thank you very much, Noelle. Yeah. I am going to finish and I made this comment when we were talking. I think for this leadership team around this table and for clearly our people at the segment level, we are absolutely humbled by how well our organization has responded to this crisis. And we thank our employees and our leadership in the field for keeping focus on the task at hand and keeping our employees safe. We are going to do everything we can to keep doing that. We will get through this next phase of whatever we are in right now with this pandemic and hopefully come out here in the first quarter with solutions to this problem. Thank you all very much, and I guess, we won't talk to you until the New Year. Be well."

[Operator Instructions] Mr. Haskel Kwestel with FTI Consulting, you may begin.\nHaskel Kwestel: Thank you, Lara, and good morning everyone. Welcome to the EMCOR Group conference call. We are here today to discuss the company's 2020 second quarter results which were reported this morning. I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Matz, Executive Vice President of Shared Services, who will introduce management. Kevin, please go ahead.\nKevin Matz: Thank you, Haskle, and good morning everyone. Thank you for your interest in EMCOR, and welcome to our earnings conference call for the second quarter of 2020. How time has really moved on. And as I said in our last call, I hope you and your families are well, staying safe as we move through this unprecedented time. For those of you who are accessing the call via the Internet and our Web site, welcome, and we hope you have arrived at the beginning of our slide presentation that will accompany our remarks today. Please advance to slide two. This presentation and discussion contains forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial information. Page two describes in detail the forward-looking statements and the non-GAAP financial information disclosures. I encourage everyone to review both disclosures in conjunction with our discussion and accompanied slide. Slide three shows executives who are with me to discuss the quarter and six months' result. They are Tony Guzzi, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Pompa, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and our Senior Vice President and General Counsel, Maxine Mauricio. For call participants not accessing the call directly via the Internet, this presentation including our slides will be archived in the Investor Relations section of our Web site under Presentations, and again, you can find this at emcorgroup.com. With that being said, let me turn the call over to Tony.\nTony Guzzi: Thanks a lot, Kevin, and I will be addressing pages four through six. Let me first start by thanking our employees for their extraordinary efforts in these continued challenging times. Our performance under these conditions is outstanding. Our organization showed the grit, resiliency, discipline, and innovation that we are known for, and we stayed focus on keeping our employees safe while executing for our customers. Turning to our financial results, throughout our discussion all my financial commentary disregards the impact of the impairment charge that Mark will cover in detail. We earned an adjusted $1.44 diluted share for the second quarter. Adjusted operating income margins for the second quarter were a strong 5.47%. Operating cash flow is excellent at $276 million on a year-to-date basis. We accomplished this in an environment where we had 15.5% negative organic revenue growth for the quarter just ended. Our Mechanical Construction segment performance was exceptional with operating income growth of 24% and 8.5% operating income margins. Our Electrical Construction segment had strong operating income margins of 7.2%, despite having a 21.7% decrease in revenues as they were more significantly impacted by the mandated shutdowns than our Mechanical Construction segment was, and further, the Electrical Construction segment is more exposed to the volatility caused by oil and gas exposure in this segment. Our U.S. Building Services segment had a very strong quarter with 5.6% operating income margins, despite a 9.8% revenue decrease. We saw demand improved through the quarter, especially in our mechanical services and government services businesses. We exited the quarter in a nice, hot, steamy summer with an even more competitive cost structure. Our Industrial Services segment is also moving ahead in a very challenged market. Our customers are cutting cost, deferring work, and fighting through a really tough market for them, and as a result, for us. We will continue to maximize any opportunity available, cut cost, and look to write flexible solutions when possible. I don't anticipate this strength to improve until at least the first quarter of 2021 at the earliest. We are fortunate to be a segment leader, and have longstanding relationships with the most important customers in the downstream refining and petrochemical markets. Our U.K. segment had a strong quarter, and we expect this execution and performance to continue. They face many of the same challenges that our U.S. Building Services segment faced. However, our U.K. customer base is more institutional, manufacturing, and government-focused, and as a result, we are stable [indiscernible] employments throughout the U.K. shutdown as we were deemed essential in many cases. So, how did we continue performing in this environment, and how will we continue to perform? My comments cut across all EMCOR reporting segments. We outlined some of these actions on our first quarter call in April, and we executed well. So, number one, we focused on employee safety first, and as a result, we were able to staff job safely and with the right people. Said differently, our people had confidence that we would do the right thing. We implemented guidelines to keep operating, and when necessary to reopen. We aggressively procured the PPE, that's the Personal Protective Equipment, upfront that our employees needed to keep working, and we executed the training necessary to work safely in this environment. We communicated at all levels with a focus on safety, execution, and results. Our flat organizational structure helped our communications remain effective, and unhampered, despite COVID-related challenges. Number two, we thoroughly and quickly implemented all the different government mandates and programs with respect to COVID. Our staff did a superb job in distilling these mandates and programs into specific actions for our subsidiary operations to continue operating productively and safely, and in compliance with these varied government mandates. Number three, we aggressively cut SG&A through both the short and long-term measures. We cut executive pay 25% in the quarter, cut other salary employees pay in the quarter, furloughed staff, permanent laid-off salary staff, cut almost all travel and entertainment expenses, and reduced any additional discretionary expenses. We reduced $21 million in the quarter versus the year-ago period, and when removing incremental SG&A for businesses acquired, we cut $28 million on an organic basis. I expect about half of those cuts to be permanent. We acted fast and decisively, and it shows in our results. Further, we aggressively right-sized our craft labor workforce to match demand through layoffs and furloughs. Number four, we knew we had to comp out what would be reduced productivity, because of increased use of PPE, and the implementation of other COVID-related safety measures. We have successfully combined to this challenge, and met this challenge by working with our customers and our workforce to offer better scheduling, planning, and work practices. We believe for the most part that we are near breakeven on a productivity basis to where we would have been pre-COVID. Number five, we trained our field and sales force on IAQ, that is, Indoor Air Quality; and other building enhancements products and projects during the initial phases of COVID, so we would be ready to provide solutions for our customers to be able to return to their facilities with confidence and in an improved indoor environment. Number six, our subsidiary leaders led us well as any organization that I could imagine. I'll say that again, our subsidiary leaders led us well as any organization that I could imagine, and they executed all the above initiatives I just mentioned in an exceptional manner. With all that said, we leave the quarter with a strong RPO position of $4.6 billion, our balance sheet stripping through the quarter, despite adverse conditions, and an even more competitive cost structure than we already had. With all that said, I will turn the discussion over to Mark.\nMark Pompa: Thank you, Tony, and good morning to everyone participating on the call today. For those accessing this presentation via the webcast, we are now on slide seven. Over the next several slides, I will supplement Tony's opening commentary on EMCOR's second quarter performance, as well as provide an update on our year-to-date results through June 30. All financial information reference is derived from our consolidated financial statements included in both our earnings release announcement and Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this morning. So, let's revisit and expand our review of EMCOR's second quarter performance. Consolidated revenues of $2 billion are down $310.2 million or 13.3% over quarter two, 2019. Our second quarter results include $50.2 million of revenues attributable to businesses acquired pertaining to the time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR on last year's second quarter. Acquisition revenues positively impacted both our United States Mechanical Construction and United States Building Services segments. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired, second quarter consolidated revenues decreased approximately $360.4 million or 15.5%. All of EMCOR's reportable segments experienced quarter-over-quarter revenue declines as a result of the containment and mitigation measures mandated by certain of our customers, as well as numerous governmental authorities in response to COVID-19. This resulted in facilities' closures and project delays, which impacted our ability to execute on our remaining performance obligations in many of the geographies that we serve. The specifics to each of our reportable segments are as follows. The United States Electrical Construction segment revenues of $445.9 million decreased $123.5 million, or 21.7% from 2019 second quarter. In addition to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on second quarter revenues, the unfavorable variance year-over-year is partially attributable to 2019's all-time record quarterly revenue performance. Revenue declines in most of the market sectors we serve were partially offset by quarter-over-quarter revenue growth in the institutional and hospitality market sectors. United States Mechanical Construction segment revenues of $790.4 million decreased $32.7 million or 4% from quarter two, 2019. Excluding acquisition revenues of $47.9 million, this segment's revenues decreased organically 9.8% quarter-over-quarter. Revenue declines in manufacturing and commercial market sector activities were muted by revenue gains quarter-over-quarter within the institutional transportation and healthcare market sectors. The prior-year quarter also represented an all-time quarterly revenue record for U.S. Mechanical Construction segment. Second quarter revenues from EMCOR's combined United States construction business of $1.24 billion decreased $156.2 million or 11.2%. As Tony will cover later during his presentation, our combined United States construction business has experienced growth both sequentially and year-over-year, and the remaining performance obligations through June 30. Some of this growth in RPOs has come at the expense of revenue generation during the second quarter due to COVID-19. However, we were also successful in obtaining new project opportunities during this period. United States Building Services quarterly revenues of $472.4 million decreased $51.3 million or 9.8%. Excluding acquisition revenues of $2.3 million, the segment's revenues decreased 10.2% from the record results achieved in the second quarter of 2019. Reduced project and controls activities within their Mechanical Services division, largely attributable to the impact of COVID-19 as well as large project activity in their Energy Services division were the primary drivers of the quarterly revenue decline. Additionally, as I mentioned on previous calls, we're continuing to see a reduction in IDIQ project activity within our Government Services division, due to both a smaller contract base as well as an overall reduction in government spending. EMCOR's Industrial Services segment was significantly impacted by the sharp decrease and volatility in crude oil prices resulting from geopolitical tensions between OPEC and Russia as well as the dramatic reduction in demand for refined oil products due to the containment and mitigation measures implemented in response to COVID-19. These factors have resulted in decreased demand for our services as this segment's customer base has initiated severe cost containment measures which have resulted in the deferral or cancellation of previously planned maintenance, as well as the suspension of most capital spending programs. As a result, our Industrial Services segment second quarter revenues declined $212.2 million from the $295.5 million reported in 2019 second quarter. This represents a reduction of $83.3 million or 28.2%. United Kingdom Building Services revenues of $93.1 point million decreased $19.4 million or 17.3% from last year's quarter. The period-over-period revenue reduction was primarily attributable to a decrease in project activities, resulting from COVID-19 containment and mitigation measures instituted by the U.K. government. This segment's quarterly revenues were also negatively impacted by $3.4 million of foreign exchange headwinds. Please turn to slide eight. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $205.2 million represent 10.2% of revenues and reflect a decrease of $21.1 million from quarter two, 2019. SG&A for the second quarter includes approximately $7.2 million of incremental expenses from businesses acquired, inclusive of intangible asset amortization resulting in an organic quarter-over-quarter decrease of approximately $28.3 million. The decline in organic selling, general and administrative expense is primarily due to certain cost reductions resulting from or actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes the period-over-period decrease in salaries expense due to both reduce headcount as well as temporary salary reductions. Additionally, incentive compensation expenses decreased due to lower projected annual operating results relative to incentive targets when compared to the prior year. Lastly, we have experienced reductions in both medical claims as well as certain discretionary spending such as travel and entertainment costs quarter-over-quarter. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of revenues is due to the reduction in quarterly consolidated revenues without a commensurate decrease in certain of our fixed overhead costs, as we do not deem the current operating environment to be permanent. During the second quarter, we identified certain indicators and the impairment within those of our businesses that are highly dependent on the strength of the oil and gas and related industrial markets. Previously referenced volatility in crude oil prices, as well as the containment and mitigation measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the demand for our services within these businesses resulting in revised near term revenue and operating margin expectations. These negative developments additionally resulted in uncertainty within the U.S. equity markets, which led to an increase in the weighted average cost of capital utilized in our appointment analysis. The combination of lower forecasted revenue and profitability along with a higher weighted average cost of capital has resulted in the recognition of a $232.8 million non-cash impairment charge during the quarter. $225.5 million of his charge pertains to a write-off of goodwill associated with our Industrial services reporting unit, while the remaining $7.3 million relates to the diminution and value of certain trade names and fixed assets within our United States Industrial Services and our United States Electrical Construction segments. As a result of the non-cash impairment charge just referenced, we're reporting an operating loss for the second quarter of 2020 of $122.6 million, which represents a decrease in absolute dollars of $242.6 million when compared to operating income of $120 million reported in the comparable 2019 period. On an adjusted basis, excluding the impact of the non-cash impairment loss, our second quarter operating income would have been $110.1 million, which represents a period-over-period decrease of $9.8 million or 8.2%. While adjusted operating income has declined, we have experienced an increase in operating margin on an adjusted basis. For the second quarter 2020, our non-GAAP operating margin was 5.5%, compared to our reported operating margin of 5.2% in the second quarter of 2019, reflecting strong operating conversion within most of our reportable segments. Considering the operating environment during the quarter, our entire team did a great job. Specific quarterly performance by reporting segment is as follows. Our U.S. Electrical Construction Services segment operating income of $32.2 million, decreased $11.6 million from the comparable 2019 period. Reported operating margin of 7.2%, represents a 50 basis point decline over last year's second quarter. The reduction in quarterly operating income and operating margin is due to the significant decrease in revenues as well as the impact of favorable project closeouts within 2019 second quarter. Second quarter operating income of our U.S. Mechanical Construction Services segment of $66.9 million, represents a $13 million increase from last year's quarter. Despite the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, this segment experienced an increase in gross profit within the commercial institutional and healthcare market sectors. Operating margin of 8.5%, improved 190 basis points over the 6.6 operating margin generated in 2019, primarily due to a more favorable revenue mix than in the year ago quarter. Our total U.S. construction business is reporting $99.1 million of operating income and an 8% operating margin. This performance has improved by $1.4 million and 100 basis points of operating margin from 2019 second quarter. In addition, it represents a sequential improvement from 2020s first quarter in both absolute dollars and margin performance. Operating income for U.S. Building Services is $26.4 million or 5.6% of revenues, and although reduce by $1.6 million from last year's second quarter, represents a 30 basis point improvement in operating margin. The quarter-over-quarter reduction in operating income is due to lower gross profit contributions from their mobile mechanical services and energy services division as a result of reductions in revenues as previously mentioned. The improvement in operating margin is due to a better mix of service maintenance and repair activities within the segments, mobile mechanical services division. Our U.S. Industrial Services segment operating income of $3 million represents a decrease of $13.1 million from last year's second quarter operating income of $16 million. Operating margin of a segment for the three months ended June 30 2020 was 1.4%, compared to 5.4% for the three months ended June 30, 2019. The decrease in operating income and operating margin was primarily driven by the reduction in quarter-over-quarter revenues, which resulted from the adverse market conditions mentioned during today's call, as well as significant pricing pressure due to limited shop services opportunities. U.K. Building Services operating income of $5.4 million was essentially flat with 2019 second quarter, as foreign exchange headwinds accounted for the modest period-over-period decline. Operating margin of 5.7% represents an 80 basis point increase over last year, as a result of improved maintenance contract performance as well as the implementation of cost containment measures, which resulted in SG&A expense reductions. We are now on slide nine. Additional financial items of significance for the quarter not addressed on the previous slides are as follows. Quarter two gross profit of $315.3 million is reduced from 2019 second quarter by $31.1 million or 9%. Despite this reduction in gross profit dollars, we did experience an improvement in gross profit as a percentage of revenues with a reported gross margin of 15.7%, which is 80 basis points higher than last year's quarter. As previously mentioned on this call, we had exceptional revenue conversion within our U.S. Mechanical Construction segment, as well as margin expansion within both our U.S. and U.K. Building Services segments. We are reporting a loss per diluted share of $1.52 as compared to earnings per diluted share in last year's second quarter of $1.49. On an adjusted basis after adding back the impairment loss on goodwill, identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is $1.44, as compared to the same report at $1.49 in last year's quarter. This represents a modest reduction of $0.05 or just over 3%. Not to be repetitive in my commentary, but in light of COVID-19 in the economic backdrop we all experienced during the last several months EMCOR has done a great job of maximizing returns were given the opportunity to deliver it services. Please turn to slide 10. With the quarter commentary complete, let's turn our attention to EMCOR's first six-month results. Revenues of $4.31 billion represent a decrease of $169.1 million or 3.8% when compared to revenues of $4.4 8 billion in the corresponding prior year period. Our second quarter revenue declines offset revenue gains posted in quarter one at each of our U.S. Mechanical Construction, U.S. Building Services, U.S. Industrial Services and U.K. Building Services segments, while our U.S. Electrical Construction Services segment has had two consecutive quarters of revenue contraction. Year-to-date gross profit of $648.3 million is lower than the 2019 six-month period by $6.8 million, or a modest 1%. Year-to-date gross margin is 15%, which favorably compares to 2019 year-to-date gross margin of 14.6%. Gross Margin improvement was largely driven by our combined U.S. construction business, as well as our U.K. Building Services segment. Selling general and administrative expenses of $432.2 million for the 2020 six-month period represent 10% of revenues compared to $432.4 million or 9.6% of revenues in 2019. While SG&A for the year-to-date period has decreased nominally from the prior year to substantial cost reduction measures implemented in the second quarter have positioned us at a lower run rate than at this time last year. We reported a loss per diluted share of $0.14 for the six months ended June 30, 2020, which compares to diluted earnings per share of $2.77 in the corresponding 2019 period. Adjusting the results for the current year to exclude the non-cash impairment loss on goodwill identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets resulted in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.78. When comparing this as adjusted number to last year's reported amount $2.77, we are reporting a $0.01 increase. I would like to remind everyone on the call that our performance for the first six months of 2019 set records for most financial metrics with earnings per share in particular, exceeding the prior benchmark by almost 30%. Not to marginalize the sizable impairment charge taken this year, but the fact that on an adjusted basis, we were able to slightly exceed our previous year record. Despite the extraordinary market challenges presented. I believe EMCOR has done quite an exceptional job. My last comment on the slide pertains to EMCOR's income tax rate for 2020. As noted on the slide EMCOR's tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2020 was 59.4%. Our tax rate for the remainder of 2020 will continue to be impacted by the impairment charges recorded during the second quarter, the majority of which were non-deductible for non-GAAP for tax purposes. So with that said at this time our full-year estimated tax rate is between 58% and 59%. However, this can change if any discrete tax events occur during the remainder of the year. We are now on slide 11. I spent some time during our quarter one earnings call detailing enforce liquidity profile. As a reminder, the first quarter historically -- is historically our weakest from a cash generation standpoint, due to funding a prior year earned incentive awards. In addition, 2020's first quarter was negatively impacted by our inability to monetize certain of our first quarter revenue activities, due to delays and customer billings, resulting from our previously communicated ransomware attack. However, as Tony mentioned we had record operating cash flow for the first-half of the year, and as a result of liquidity profile has improved from our already strong position. With strong operating cash flow through June, we have paid down to $200 million revolving credit borrowings outstanding as of March 31, 2020, and our cash on hand has increased to $481.4 million from the approximately $359 million on our year-end 2019 balance sheet. The improvement on operating cash flow was due to excellent working capital management by our subsidiary leadership teams, as well as the benefit with deferral of certain tax payments, due to government measures enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These measures which included the deferral of estimated U.S. federal income tax payments, the employer's portion of Social Security tax payments, and the remission of value-added tax for our U.K. subsidiary have favorably impacted second quarter and year-to-date cash flow by approximately $100 million. Please note that while we will continue to benefit from some of these deferrals throughout the remainder of 2020, our estimated U.S. federal tax payments were funded subsequent to the quarter on July 15th. Changes and additional key balance sheet positions are as follows. Working Capital levels have increased primarily due to the increase in cash just referenced. Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets have decreased since December 31, 2019 largely as a result of the impairment charges previously referenced. In addition intangible assets have decreased as a result of $29.4 million of amortization during the year-to-date period. Stockholder's equity has declined due to the operating loss recognized during the first six months of 2020. EMCOR's debt-to-capitalization ratio of 13.5% is essentially flat, when compared to our position at 2019 year-end, and is reduced from 19.9% at March 31, 2020. We have just over $1.2 billion of availability under our revolving credit line and anticipate that we will continue to generate positive operating cash flow during the last six months of calendar 2020. EMCOR's balance sheet and resulting liquidity position remains strong and we continue to preserve our flexibility and evaluate all market opportunities. With my commentary concluded, I will now turn the call back to Tony, Tony.\nTony Guzzi: Thanks, Mark, and I'm on page 12 remaining performance obligation by segment and market sector. In short, we continue to work and have seen our small productivity improved for the second quarter, as it hit a low point in April for bookings and execution, some comparisons to consider. Total RPOs at the end of the second quarter, were just about $4.6 billion, up $365 billion or 8.6%, when compared to the June 2019 level of $4.23 billion. RPOs also increased a $160 7 million from the first quarter of 2020 reflectivity continued demand, as we are seeing for market -- continued demand we are seeing for our services and our markets. So, for the first six months of 2020, total RPOs increased $555 million or 13.8% from December 31. With all this growth, only $11 million relates to a tuck-in acquisition, so almost all that growth is organic. Domestic RPOs have increased $346 million or 8.4% just a year ago period drive mainly by our Mechanical Construction segment. We did run through some electrical construction project as we completed some complex work. However, we expect to backfill these projects, as we continue to see demand, especially in the high-tech and data market and high-tech for us means semiconductor and the datacenter market. Our U.S. Building Services segment RPOs dipped a little in the quarter as the segments project work was first impacted by COVID-19 building access delays and decision-making. As the economy opens up, combined with the hotter weather, we are getting more access to facilities and seeing the resumption of our work. Additionally, both of our Industrial services in EMCOR U.K. segments increased RPO level by roughly 15%, respectively from June 30, 2019. On the right side of the page we have on 12 we show RPOs by market sector. Of the eight market sectors listed all had year-over-year RPO increases except for manufacturing and industrial. This is not to be confused with our Industrial segment. Currently we're in the process of competing some major food processing projects. We continue to see demand for these large complicated projects, and have a number of potential opportunities we are looking at. Commercial project RPOs comprised our largest sector -- market sector that were 40% of the total. This is had 19% increase from year-end referred via our data center projects, and as we've said before, we are uniquely suited for these fast paced, especially in the hyper scale projects from both in electrical and mechanical perspective. Other very active markets for us are healthcare, water, and wastewater, with these sectors being up 25% and 49% respectively, from year-end 2019. Today, we have not seen any material slowdown in bidding opportunities, apart from the mandated areas that was New York, New Jersey, Boston and parts of California and a little bit in Pennsylvania. However, these areas are now open. As I said earlier, the industry has adapted safety -- safe work practices and protocols to keep project progressing, and especially to keep workers safe. Finally, we are positioned very well to help our customers as they adjust their HVAC in building, control systems to improve the IQ, and cleanliness of their buildings and other facilities. It starts with the introduction of more outside air into the space as one of the simplest ways to make a building healthier, but unfortunately, this makes the building less efficient. We have strong experience in IQ systems and our service companies and mechanical contractors know how to implement UV lights; bipolar ionization, enhanced filtering, and control system modifications. Most of this work will never make it into reported RPOs from a quarter-to-quarter basis and it is quick turn, high margin activity. Together, it will mount to a nice media -- medium sized project with good margins. I do expect these IQ additions to longer terms for a more robust HVAC replacement market, as we seek to increase efficiency to combat the increase in IAQ, especially the introduction of outside air. So, as I said in our first quarter call, I don't know exactly how all the works specifically we will roll out, and how that booking will be, it's a fluid and challenging environment. There will be bumps along the way. However, the direction of future opportunities for a contractor like us remains pointed in a positive direction. So now I'm going to close on pages 13 to 14. When we went through guidance in April, we said we had hoped that we could provide a view on the outlook for the remainder of the year during the second quarter earnings call. We have spent the last few weeks debating internally whether to provide more definitive versus generic guidance for the remainder of the year. We have decided to provide more specific guidance with some caveats, which mostly deal with the external environment. The main caveat is we expect operating conditions to remain similar to -- as to today's operating conditions where most of the country is opened for our type of work. And we are deemed in essential activity. So we decided to give guidance as to the why and what as outlined below. Subject to that main caveat, we're likely going to earn $5 to $5.50 diluted earnings per share this year on an adjusted basis adding back the impact of impairment. I think revenues will likely be $8.6 billion to $8.7 billion. In this revenue guidance, it is our expectation from our recent forecast, where we believe that all of our reporting segments will grow revenues in the second-half of the year versus the first-half of the year, except for our Industrial Services segment. We now understand how COVID-19 has impacted our productivity. We are seeing stabilization a small project work, and the summer heat is helping our U.S. Building Services segment, we have a strong RPO position, and we see markets recovering, especially in our mechanical, Electrical Construction segments, and in our U.S. and U.K. Building Services segments. So, how do you move up in this range largely will depend on three factors. The external marker remains largely same or even improved from today's operating environment. Under today's conditions, we can book and execute work, keep our workforce productive, and we believe we will continue to see the recovery in the small project work. You know if the Industrial Services segment folks have an opportunity to help customers in an unexpected way, then we will perform slightly better than expected, and we have no major project disruptions or any new significant customer bankruptcies. So, as far as capital allocation, the dividend is safe for the foreseeable future, however we're unlikely to make any more share repurchase in the near-term. We will look to execute accessible tuck-in acquisitions where we have decent visibility into and belief in the long-term success of the acquisition. That's really no different than any time we buy a company, and we based on the business, the market and the improvements we can make, we have several potential mechanical or Electrical Construction segment acquisitions and are in the preliminary stage of discussion on several mechanical services, a few small ones and Fire Protection acquisitions that we will likely execute. Thanks for all your support during these challenging times, and with that, I'll take questions. Lara?\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now live, sir. Go ahead, please.\nTony Guzzi: Good morning, Brent.\nBrent Thielman: Hey, thank you. Hey, good morning. Congratulations on a great quarter.\nTony Guzzi: Thanks.\nBrent Thielman: Tony, on the electrical business, I think I caught this at the end, it sounds like they certainly were more impacted by some of these market disruptions. Can you just walk me through, are you expecting most of those headwinds to abate as we move into the second-half of the year as we think about the outlook?\nTony Guzzi: Yes, look I think the core of our electrical business, which is commercial construction and institutional construction, and healthcare construction to continue to be fine and look like the mechanical business. In the electrical business that's a little bit different is we have a position in oil and gas. If you'll remember that's where four years ago we bought Ardent and Rabalais, it's in that segment. Ardent had a terrific year last year, and we will fight through those headwinds in the back-half of the year. Mark, anything?\nMark Pompa: Yes, and Brent, the other thing is some of the major population centers that were entirely shutdown, we have significant presence on the electrical side. Some of those markets we also have mechanical presence, but more so electrical focus and the inability to be able to have our people either report to our offices for work, or certainly report to any of our customer's locations to perform any of the services was extremely difficult in the quarter, which is why you see the revenue and margin performance.\nTony Guzzi: Yes, the base business obviously is performing very well at 7.2% operating income margins, and we've had terrific performance really across the country, and like Mark said, they had to fight through the head end of shutdowns, but it will have overcome the compare on the back-half of the year in the oil and gas business.\nBrent Thielman: Okay, okay, appreciate that. And then, Tony, I obviously understand the headwinds on the Industrial Services business, just wondering if you are able to use some of that manpower and capacity maybe to benefit you in other ways or in other segments, sort of through these tough times right now?\nTony Guzzi: Yes, we marginally have -- look, first of all, in manpower we would use is the trade labor, and that's flexible anyway. We have used some of the trade labor to help us augment especially on the electrical side, some surging capacity we had on both the manufacturing and datacenter side, but that then normalizes. I wouldn't say to any significant manner, no.\nBrent Thielman: Okay, last one, Mark the impairment, the goodwill intangibles, was that effectively all of it associated with the Industrial segment, is there still some remaining on the balance sheet?\nMark Pompa: No, there is roughly just over $100 million of goodwill remaining in the Industrial segment post the adjustment.\nBrent Thielman: Okay, thank you.\nMark Pompa: Don't foresee an issue for the remainder of this year, but clearly that the business will have to continue to perform beyond 2021 to continue to support that record evaluation.\nBrent Thielman: Yes, understood. All right, guys, thank you. Best of luck.\nTony Guzzi: Thanks, Brent.\nMark Pompa: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Your next question will come from the line of Adam Thalhimer from Thompson Davis. Sir, your line is now live. Go ahead, sir.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey, good morning guys. I would also say congrats.\nTony Guzzi: Thank you.\nMark Pompa: Thanks, Adam.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey, just high level on the back-half embedded within the guidance, how do you guys see seasonality playing out this year? Usually Q4 is a little stronger than Q3, just curious.\nTony Guzzi: Yes, I mean the headwind, I mean clearly reflected in our guidance is how we see seasonality playing out, and as I said, we see stronger second-half revenues versus first-half for our reporting segments, except for Industrial, but typically, Industrial typically has a good third quarter and even first part of fourth quarter. So, we don't see that happening this year. I think for the remaining reporting segments, as long as we sort of have the operating conditions we have now, seasonality should be about what it is. Mark, am I right?\nMark Pompa: And I think Adam the only other variable is because we certainly experienced a fair amount of delays during quarter two, as much as we are able to control the pacing of the projects that we're on. I'm not quite sure, once we get through these revenue bursts to get caught up with that's going to do in quarter four. So, not all of our projects start on January 1 and end on December 31, as I'm sure everybody in this call knows, but I think with the compression of things that have to get performed between July 1 and December 31 of 2020, you may not see seasonality consistent with what we've experienced on a historical basis.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. I think I get that. So basically, you're just saying Q3, Q4 in a model and kind of the same this year.\nTony Guzzi: Except for Industrial.\nMark Pompa: Except for Industrial.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. And then, so on Industrial, so that we've seen that segment do in recent years as low as kind of $140 million in revenue and slight operating loss, is that kind of what you are anticipating here?\nTony Guzzi: I don't know if I've seen it do $140 million in revenue\u2026\nMark Pompa: Hey, Q3 of '17, it's a while ago on a quarterly basis.\nTony Guzzi: On a quarterly basis.\nAdam Thalhimer: On a quarterly basis.\nTony Guzzi: We have taken annual.\nMark Pompa: Look, I think big picture, I think we'll make money on an EBITDA basis. We've got some goodwill and depreciation to jump over. I think profitability is going to be de-minimis on an operating income basis in the back-half of the year.\nAdam Thalhimer: And then, so with what's going on in oil and gas right now, Tony, I mean what's your thought on 2021?\nTony Guzzi: I have no idea right now. I mean one of the challenges we've had in that business over the last couple of years is the first quarter is always going to be better, right, and quite frankly, the last two have been okay. And this year was shaping up to be a good year. So, the question is going to be, let's say, we start seeing resumption of air travel, resumption of demand as you go from December, January, and February. What does that mean for refiner decision-making is maintenance. Are they going to keep running because they're finally making money again, and starting to get to better capacity utilization, or are they going to go through scheduled maintenance? Sitting here today, I don't really have any visibility on that. On the books, first quarter 2021 looks okay, but I think, boy, we're going to have to really see December before we know that.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay, understood. And then just lastly, I'm trying to rationalize this in my head, just the ABI kind of being as low as it has been for the past four months, but you guys talked about really strong bidding, and I just -- how do you guys look at that?\nTony Guzzi: Well, first of all, we're a [laggard], [ph] right, I mean we would be bidding on projects probably more [indiscernible] with an ABI in February, March. The second thing is I think it depends where and how you're competing. I've always sort of with the ABIs wrong, right, it's consistently right or consistently wrong, it's self-reported numbers. My gut, I'm not sure how that was, if I were running my architectural firm or engineering firm in the month of April and May, I'm not sure how I reported numbers with a dispersed workforce to the -- AIA would have been at the top of my list.\nAdam Thalhimer: Understood. All right, I'll let somebody else have that. Thanks, guys.\nTony Guzzi: Thanks, Adam.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. And your next question will come from the line of Noelle Dilts from Stifel. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please.\nNoelle Dilts: Hi, guys, good morning, and again congrats on a great performance in a tough market. So first, I just wanted to ask about how you're thinking about share gain? I've heard throughout earnings season a number of larger kind of higher quality players in the market saying that they think they may be gaining share because some of the smaller contractors may be distressed, just kind of curious how you're thinking about that phenomenon?\nTony Guzzi: Yes, we never think about that. Well, it's just sort of something that has ever been on our radar screen. This is a big, big market. We are the biggest of what we do, but there is a lot of competitors out there. I never sit around and worry about who is going to succeed and who is going to fail. Contractors -- there is a wonderful thing about this business, right, when things are well, we talk about contractors overextending themselves and running into working capital problems. When things are bad, we talk about contractors taking bad work, and then failing. Here is what I've learned over a long period of time. [Indiscernible] to what you do to convey to make money on the market that's available to you to make money, grow when it's responsible to grow in that local market, shrink when you need to adjust your cost structure, and never count on your competitors making a good decision in a changing market. All that being said, I don't think there will be a lot of contractors that are sizeable that say that $15 million to $20 million contractor that will necessarily fell in this market because of the PPP loans. I think they will survive, and the question is, what does that look like a year from now?\nNoelle Dilts: Okay, great. That's helpful. And I guess it's sort of a related question, but I think last quarter, you kind of talked a little bit about it just being tough when you're looking at M&A opportunities, kind of trying to get a sense of where the market is going, how to think about the risk with some of the targets you might be looking at, and then also the price that was kind of being demanded at that time. Are you starting to see things come into balance, what are you just seeing in terms of pricing in the market at the moment when you are looking at some of these targets?\nTony Guzzi: So, we tend to look through the cycle. We closed an acquisition today in our Building Services segment to augment and strengthen our Mechanical Services segment. It's a very good mechanicals contractor that focuses on retrofit and the interiors market. We have a pretty good service company there that we think long-term together, they'll be dynamite. Of course, we have large project capability on the mechanical side with our [indiscernible]. So this is a nice fit, and an important market with a company that we've known for a long time, and we can sort of look through the cycle and look through the market into performance, and it is performing very well. And we look at -- when we make a deal, we always try to look at a deal to say does this work for us, and does it work for the person selling the company. We don't want to be known as the people that are out there looking for a bargain, and if that acquisition exceeds our expectations, it became from superior execution, our ability to generate synergies especially on the revenue side for them to take more risks than they would have typically they have the capability that maybe they didn't want to expand their personal balance sheet to do that. I think there will be opportunities, but EMCOR in general does not look for distressed assets. We made it a few times in our past maybe we've ended up with them, but it wasn't intentional, and so, we're going to keep the tried and true thing we've done, look at the market, look at the position in the market of the person we're thinking of buying. If it's a very small acquisition, is it going to tuck into one of our larger acquisition-driven medium size acquisition to our larger subsidiaries, that's largely how we've built the fire protection business with two anchor acquisitions overtime and many, many years ago, and look to generate the right kind of synergies on the revenue side. And of course, do the cost takeout were responsible.\nNoelle Dilts: Thanks. That's very helpful. I guess one last question that expands a bit on what Adam was asking about. When you look out at 2021 on the non-res side of the market, you've talked about a lot of the high tech verticals and data center being really strong, and any other verticals where you're feeling kind of more confident, as you look out next year versus those where you might feel a little more cautious. And then, you spent a lot of time talking about the opportunity around indoor air quality and maybe some remodel, any way that you can help investors think about the size of that market and the opportunity?\nTony Guzzi: Let's start big picture. I don't know what will happen in on non-res, and how what happened in second quarter will impact the overall numbers. You know whether it will be up or down once you correct for the second quarter. If the second quarter didn't have such an anomaly, maybe it would be down a little bit, but I don't know that, but with the second quarter being off as much, it could actually be up a little bit right on a real basis year-to-year. When I think about it, you know, what's likely to be challenged, right? I think just flat out commercial office space will be challenged except for maybe the renovation and the potential retrofit and replacement market. I don't think there will be a lot of new construction going on, although there are several projects that were involved with, I think will get built. It's funny, when I went back and looked at data, as we got rid of for the first quarter column today. We haven't been involved in a high rise commercial office building in any substantial way for four years.\nMark Pompa: Greenfield.\nTony Guzzi: Yes, yes, Greenfield, yes, Mark, thanks, Greenfield. We are always doing retrofit work. We're always doing tenant fit work. So I think the Greenfield market will be more challenged. I think residential high rise was already starting to become challenged. I think that will continue to be challenged. I think anything around technology is going to do well. And that includes build office space. I don't think we're going to walk away from working in offices forever. I think it'll be a hybrid model, and that will require reconfiguration of spaces. And I'm not sure if people are going to be as excited about their open Office plans as they have in the future, because most people want to have contingency plans to operate much like we are today in our offices. I think that the healthcare market will have some stress for us potentially, as you see in our backlog, because spaces are going to be adjusted, and there're some big projects out there that we're looking at today. I think that the manufacturing/industrial for us potentially could get strong. It's going to look like an anomaly for a while, as our big food processors jobs move in and out. I think that will continue to be a market that will be strong for us. I'm actually fairly significant believer in onshore, and I think we're starting to see that happen. We've seen it over the last couple years, but I think it's not only going to be from China back to the U.S. I think there will be a challenge for Mexico to attract new business, and people build redundant supply here in the U.S. versus Mexico, because the [Maquiladora] [ph] story was a tough story. We hear from some of our customers and supply lines here in the second quarter with COVID, and they found how difficult it could be operate with the current government. I think that the institutional market will be a little bit slower than I think it will pick up as buildings get reconfigured. And in the education market, again, you're going to have to think about IAQ, IAQ then drive efficiency. And so this whole replacement market where we support, we do a little bit ourselves in a couple states, but for the most part, we support the heck out of the performance contractors. They could in fact see an uptick in their business late '21 going into '22. I think water and wastewater will continue to be a good market for us mainly because of we have location, location, location, a lot going on down in South Florida, and will be part of that. I don't think that hospitality will be a real area of strength for anybody here anytime soon. In fact, we can argue here at EMCOR we maybe just start blending out with our commercial sector. We just leave it off there for comparison sake. Is that helpful?\nNoelle Dilts: Perfect. Yes. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you.\nTony Guzzi: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Sean Eastman from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Go ahead please.\nSean Eastman: Hi, guys, compliment your team on a strong effort and solid quarter. I was just curious I think one of the highlights here in the second quarter is just that RPO picking up sequentially considering this backdrop here, but I guess part of that is kind of helped by a lighter revenue quarter, and you're anticipating the revenue run rate to pick up here in the back-half. So I'm just kind of wondering about that second-half dynamic, you know, should we expect some RPO to sort of work down in the second-half. How should we be thinking about that?\nTony Guzzi: I'll let Mark jump in here too. Where I look at it is, it depends. We have several projects we're looking at that they get awarded in a rather significant, than you won't see that. We've also seen more stability in the small project activity. That is now part of our RPOs, so you'll look back many years that wouldn't have been necessarily in there.\nMark Pompa: I think one of the things that will be a little bit of a headwind is we're completing one heck of a food process job right now, and much like we had three years ago, we had a little gap. We may have that again now. We have some very good prospects there. I think that book and build business underneath it is okay.\nSean Eastman: Could there be an air pocket to develop because of decision-making in April, May tying back to this ABI number when architecture and engineers were working remotely?\nTony Guzzi: Yes, that could happen, but I don't think it's long-term yet. Our working assumption with EMCOR has been for a while that things don't get really normal until first quarter of '21, and we've been sort of configuring our business and working that way for a while. So, we're sort of looking around all those pieces. Mark?\nMark Pompa: Yes. So, on the only thing I would add to Tony is -- amplified from Tony's commentary is that some of the revenue improvement we're looking at in the back-half of the year is going to be coming from the project work that's going to come off the maintenance because of the season -- the more normal seasonality and while that we are saying, and most of the geographies where we have mechanical services capabilities. And as Tony indicated, a lot of that work actually never actually goes into RPOs, just one of the quick turn nature of it. Conversely because we're looking at revenue to decline from the back-half for the year within our Industrial Services segment, other than the shop piece of that business as you know. That's all our workers time and material, so I never actually impacted the RPO number. So I'm not necessarily convinced that you're going to see the same level of sequential growth. As we move to the third quarter, but I think with all of the opportunities out there and what we are executing again. I would like to say there's going to be no worse than flat, it's not slightly either as we progress through quarter three and quarter four, and putting aside some of those larger projects when we talk about depending on the timing of one, if they are awarded and if they are awarded just when they come in to the next spot.\nSean Eastman: Okay, got it, helpful. Next is just on the Construction segment margins, it's interesting to see both of them hanging in pretty well here particularly mechanical, the second quarter, just any update on the margin trajectory in those segments, you guys mentioned mix, completing projects, cost controls and a big thing here in the near-term, any reason why these levels aren't sort of sustainable or whether they are normalized margin ranges shouldn't be attainable, even into out year, even\u2026\nTony Guzzi: I would go to latter, not the former. I don't think 8.5% mechanical margin is sustainable for extended period of time. I think, we've had these in the past where they jump in and out, we always say look back 12 months, and that gives you every three or four quarters, it gives you a pretty good idea, how we're performing. We've said for a long time anywhere from 6% to 7.5% mechanically is pretty good performance. I guess we ticked that up to 6.5% mechanically, which is pretty good as a baseline to seven. Anyhow maybe 7.5%, we are finishing jobs. These are going better than expected. Electrically, we've been performing at these levels for a long time, those sectors are led by people that really know how to cut cost when they need to, not, how to meter back in the cost, a lot of it happens upfront, right? We don't have big write-offs typically, may be we have them every three or four years. Usually, most of it's not our fault, and we do a pretty good job recovery sometimes. A third at any given time might be our fault, and so, we do a good job, avoiding badness. I always say margins are driven by and absence of that is an executing or good work when you have it. So that funnel upfront is very important and we have been very careful right now, on the kind of job we're selecting, and at the beginning of this COVID thing, people were like getting a little desperate, we then participate, and we've seen more normal fitting resume. So yes, longwinded answer to normalize margins, these are a little high right now for mechanical, but you know, I look back 12 months we are doing okay. Mark?\nMark Pompa: Yes. I think, I see no reason that we are not going to continue to perform at our historical averages and they are really, if you even look at the last 36 months relative to our construction operations on a combined basis. They've been fairly consistent within 50 basis points. So the work that's remaining to be performed in our remaining performance obligations as margin profiles consistent with what you've seen us on, and we were going to continue to operate under our operational excellence program and continue to do what's best for a customer, so\u2026\nTony Guzzi: Yes, we didn't believe that, we would have put the guidance out that we did, right, I mean, and our major question mark in the back-half of the year really centers around Industrial, and maybe to a much lesser extent, as small project work, and Mark went through why we believe that will keep going at much lesser extent than what could happen with small project only because it's the valve they can turn on and off. Not anything we are actually seeing today. Just if things are really bad like that they did in April that valve we will turn off again. And we said that in our guidance, that's one of the caveats.\nSean Eastman: Got it. I will leave it there. Thanks so much for the time. Really appreciate it.\nTony Guzzi: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you so much. And for your last question, we have one from Joe Mondillo from Sidoti & Company. Your line is now live. So, go ahead please.\nTony Guzzi: Hey, Joe.\nJoe Mondillo: Hi, good morning everyone. Sorry, I got dropped off the call for about four minutes maybe just a little just a couple minutes ago. I am not sure what happened, but I wanted to ask about sort of the COVID-related opportunity in terms of air quality and work there. I know it's probably still early, but I am wondering what your thoughts are on how big off an opportunity that could be in terms of retrofit buildings for air quality.\nTony Guzzi: Yes, I would break it into two pieces, Joe. The first piece is what you are doing today to take existing systems and making more friendly for better indoor environment. I think when you add all that up at EMCOR, it will be a nice project, it will be a -- altogether, it will be a sort of $12 million to $20 million project with above average margins. These things are going to happen somewhere between $2 and $10,000 at a time, maybe $20 at the top under typical 100,000 square foot of space. That's sort of what they are. However, the longer term opportunity is okay, we need what we needed to do with the system we had. Now, how do we make sure that we have a better built space for the long-term? We do a lot of this on newer building. So, you are going to have to update the HVAC system and the control system because IAQ for the most part -- the biggest part of it is bringing in more outside air. I mean that's the first thing you could do, and it's actually one of the most effective things you can do. That works across purposes with efficiency. So, I believe that as you play this out over a two-year period, you are going to see the replacement market get stronger going from in the middle '21 and beyond. And it's already a pretty good replacement market because equipment is so much more variable and efficient today than it was even just 10 years ago. So, I think that's a second phase you will see. And then, I think of course, there will be added HVAC content and controls content in new builds. We are already seeing that, but you will see even more of that, and any of you, if you can go to a specific case, I think when you get to the healthcare space, now that we have had this issue around ICU beds, where ICUs are in general are built to operate [indiscernible] 90% of the capacity all the time. They are very expensive. So, I think as you build new hospitals and retrofit hospitals, I think you are going to be putting in the ability to flex into more ICU space. And so, how do you do that? You introduce negative pressure, right, which creates negative pressure than ICU room. You will put the more the systems into a room and they may or not be used until you need them. So that's going to be an opportunity that's going to happen. So, IAQ is a simple thing to say, it takes all kind of different flavors; existing, today, immediate, I can do things. I can put UV lights on. I can do enhanced filtering. I can do bipolar ionization. I can increase the airflow from outside. Long-term, I can do all kind of things with a system. Those things and more, but they could be actually built in into the system. In the longer term, how do I make my space as flexible as I can either in industrial setting and office setting, or in healthcare setting, so I can adjust between different kinds of uses depending on something like this potentially happening again.\nJoe Mondillo: Okay. And so I guess when you take this sort of the -- the knit the opportunities together, how you characterize them is your best guess that's going to be more material, more in the longer terms in the mid '21 and beyond?\nTony Guzzi: Yes I think '21, it'll add on to an already good summer. I mean in '20.\nJoe Mondillo: Okay.\nTony Guzzi: I think as you get mid '21 and beyond and things start getting incorporated designed, it will be more material. You won't necessarily see. You will just know you are doing more HVAC [count] [ph] in a building, or you'll see a more rapid replacement cycle. Things get replaced to 10 or 12 years instead of 15 to 20.\nJoe Mondillo: Got it. And then, I wanted to ask regarding the cost structure, was there anything - any temporary cost reductions in the second quarter that come back say starting in 3Q regardless of revenue?\nTony Guzzi: Yes, about half it will. In my commentary, I said I think about half of these cost reductions will be permanent.\nJoe Mondillo: And did you quantify the cost reductions?\nTony Guzzi: Yes, we did. We said $21 million actual versus the year-ago period, $28 million organic. So, I think if you do that, you would say we are picking up about $10 million a quarter give or take in ongoing cost reduction.\nJoe Mondillo: Got it, okay. And then, the RPOs that mechanical segment and then just one other question after this, but the RPOs there really strong, is that surprising just given the challenge in the second quarter just with the overall economy? And then also slowing non-rent space overall, or\u2026\nTony Guzzi: No, that was -- look, [everything] [ph] is slowing in our res space, if you have the right capability in the right market via larger contractors you can generate a positive result on your RPOs because of large projects. That is in fact what happened with our larger companies in the mechanical space. We have two or three of them that really had nice bookings in the quarter.\nJoe Mondillo: Okay. And then lastly from me, did I hear right that you said you do not expect any further share repurchases for the rest of the year?\nTony Guzzi: I didn't say the rest of the year. I said in the near term and that probably for us means Q3 as of today.\nJoe Mondillo: Okay, got it. All right, thanks a lot for taking the questions.\nTony Guzzi: We expect - look along those lines, if you take our long-term view of the world and we get into a more normalized operating condition, we expect to be a balanced capital allocator like we have always have been.\nJoe Mondillo: Thanks a lot. Have a great day.\nTony Guzzi: Thank you, Joe.\nOperator: Thank you so much. And that's it for your last question. I will turn the call back to the presenters for the closing remarks.\nTony Guzzi: Okay. Look, as I finish today, I really want to thank our employees and then the leaders of the -- of our associates and our employees. This has been an unprecedented four or five months here. And everybody has just put their head down, gone to work, kept focus on our employee safety, kept focus on doing right things by our employees first the best that we could, and then focused on delivering results for our customers and keeping things on track. It's been a terrific effort by our leadership team and has been very, very exceptional effort for our broader employee base. I think this is going to continue for the next four or five months, and I know that our team will meet the challenge and we will respond to what we need to respond to keep the organization moving forward in a positive manner. So, I am going to thank all of them first and thank our customers and of course our investors also. And we will continue to try and do everything we can to deliver good results for you. With that, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you so much. And again, thank you everyone for participating. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Stay safe and have a lovely day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Pompa",
            "content": "Thank you, Tony, and good morning to everyone participating on the call today. For those accessing this presentation via the webcast, we are now on slide seven. Over the next several slides, I will supplement Tony's opening commentary on EMCOR's second quarter performance, as well as provide an update on our year-to-date results through June 30. All financial information reference is derived from our consolidated financial statements included in both our earnings release announcement and Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this morning. So, let's revisit and expand our review of EMCOR's second quarter performance. Consolidated revenues of $2 billion are down $310.2 million or 13.3% over quarter two, 2019. Our second quarter results include $50.2 million of revenues attributable to businesses acquired pertaining to the time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR on last year's second quarter. Acquisition revenues positively impacted both our United States Mechanical Construction and United States Building Services segments. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired, second quarter consolidated revenues decreased approximately $360.4 million or 15.5%. All of EMCOR's reportable segments experienced quarter-over-quarter revenue declines as a result of the containment and mitigation measures mandated by certain of our customers, as well as numerous governmental authorities in response to COVID-19. This resulted in facilities' closures and project delays, which impacted our ability to execute on our remaining performance obligations in many of the geographies that we serve. The specifics to each of our reportable segments are as follows. The United States Electrical Construction segment revenues of $445.9 million decreased $123.5 million, or 21.7% from 2019 second quarter. In addition to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on second quarter revenues, the unfavorable variance year-over-year is partially attributable to 2019's all-time record quarterly revenue performance. Revenue declines in most of the market sectors we serve were partially offset by quarter-over-quarter revenue growth in the institutional and hospitality market sectors. United States Mechanical Construction segment revenues of $790.4 million decreased $32.7 million or 4% from quarter two, 2019. Excluding acquisition revenues of $47.9 million, this segment's revenues decreased organically 9.8% quarter-over-quarter. Revenue declines in manufacturing and commercial market sector activities were muted by revenue gains quarter-over-quarter within the institutional transportation and healthcare market sectors. The prior-year quarter also represented an all-time quarterly revenue record for U.S. Mechanical Construction segment. Second quarter revenues from EMCOR's combined United States construction business of $1.24 billion decreased $156.2 million or 11.2%. As Tony will cover later during his presentation, our combined United States construction business has experienced growth both sequentially and year-over-year, and the remaining performance obligations through June 30. Some of this growth in RPOs has come at the expense of revenue generation during the second quarter due to COVID-19. However, we were also successful in obtaining new project opportunities during this period. United States Building Services quarterly revenues of $472.4 million decreased $51.3 million or 9.8%. Excluding acquisition revenues of $2.3 million, the segment's revenues decreased 10.2% from the record results achieved in the second quarter of 2019. Reduced project and controls activities within their Mechanical Services division, largely attributable to the impact of COVID-19 as well as large project activity in their Energy Services division were the primary drivers of the quarterly revenue decline. Additionally, as I mentioned on previous calls, we're continuing to see a reduction in IDIQ project activity within our Government Services division, due to both a smaller contract base as well as an overall reduction in government spending. EMCOR's Industrial Services segment was significantly impacted by the sharp decrease and volatility in crude oil prices resulting from geopolitical tensions between OPEC and Russia as well as the dramatic reduction in demand for refined oil products due to the containment and mitigation measures implemented in response to COVID-19. These factors have resulted in decreased demand for our services as this segment's customer base has initiated severe cost containment measures which have resulted in the deferral or cancellation of previously planned maintenance, as well as the suspension of most capital spending programs. As a result, our Industrial Services segment second quarter revenues declined $212.2 million from the $295.5 million reported in 2019 second quarter. This represents a reduction of $83.3 million or 28.2%. United Kingdom Building Services revenues of $93.1 point million decreased $19.4 million or 17.3% from last year's quarter. The period-over-period revenue reduction was primarily attributable to a decrease in project activities, resulting from COVID-19 containment and mitigation measures instituted by the U.K. government. This segment's quarterly revenues were also negatively impacted by $3.4 million of foreign exchange headwinds. Please turn to slide eight. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $205.2 million represent 10.2% of revenues and reflect a decrease of $21.1 million from quarter two, 2019. SG&A for the second quarter includes approximately $7.2 million of incremental expenses from businesses acquired, inclusive of intangible asset amortization resulting in an organic quarter-over-quarter decrease of approximately $28.3 million. The decline in organic selling, general and administrative expense is primarily due to certain cost reductions resulting from or actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes the period-over-period decrease in salaries expense due to both reduce headcount as well as temporary salary reductions. Additionally, incentive compensation expenses decreased due to lower projected annual operating results relative to incentive targets when compared to the prior year. Lastly, we have experienced reductions in both medical claims as well as certain discretionary spending such as travel and entertainment costs quarter-over-quarter. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of revenues is due to the reduction in quarterly consolidated revenues without a commensurate decrease in certain of our fixed overhead costs, as we do not deem the current operating environment to be permanent. During the second quarter, we identified certain indicators and the impairment within those of our businesses that are highly dependent on the strength of the oil and gas and related industrial markets. Previously referenced volatility in crude oil prices, as well as the containment and mitigation measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the demand for our services within these businesses resulting in revised near term revenue and operating margin expectations. These negative developments additionally resulted in uncertainty within the U.S. equity markets, which led to an increase in the weighted average cost of capital utilized in our appointment analysis. The combination of lower forecasted revenue and profitability along with a higher weighted average cost of capital has resulted in the recognition of a $232.8 million non-cash impairment charge during the quarter. $225.5 million of his charge pertains to a write-off of goodwill associated with our Industrial services reporting unit, while the remaining $7.3 million relates to the diminution and value of certain trade names and fixed assets within our United States Industrial Services and our United States Electrical Construction segments. As a result of the non-cash impairment charge just referenced, we're reporting an operating loss for the second quarter of 2020 of $122.6 million, which represents a decrease in absolute dollars of $242.6 million when compared to operating income of $120 million reported in the comparable 2019 period. On an adjusted basis, excluding the impact of the non-cash impairment loss, our second quarter operating income would have been $110.1 million, which represents a period-over-period decrease of $9.8 million or 8.2%. While adjusted operating income has declined, we have experienced an increase in operating margin on an adjusted basis. For the second quarter 2020, our non-GAAP operating margin was 5.5%, compared to our reported operating margin of 5.2% in the second quarter of 2019, reflecting strong operating conversion within most of our reportable segments. Considering the operating environment during the quarter, our entire team did a great job. Specific quarterly performance by reporting segment is as follows. Our U.S. Electrical Construction Services segment operating income of $32.2 million, decreased $11.6 million from the comparable 2019 period. Reported operating margin of 7.2%, represents a 50 basis point decline over last year's second quarter. The reduction in quarterly operating income and operating margin is due to the significant decrease in revenues as well as the impact of favorable project closeouts within 2019 second quarter. Second quarter operating income of our U.S. Mechanical Construction Services segment of $66.9 million, represents a $13 million increase from last year's quarter. Despite the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, this segment experienced an increase in gross profit within the commercial institutional and healthcare market sectors. Operating margin of 8.5%, improved 190 basis points over the 6.6 operating margin generated in 2019, primarily due to a more favorable revenue mix than in the year ago quarter. Our total U.S. construction business is reporting $99.1 million of operating income and an 8% operating margin. This performance has improved by $1.4 million and 100 basis points of operating margin from 2019 second quarter. In addition, it represents a sequential improvement from 2020s first quarter in both absolute dollars and margin performance. Operating income for U.S. Building Services is $26.4 million or 5.6% of revenues, and although reduce by $1.6 million from last year's second quarter, represents a 30 basis point improvement in operating margin. The quarter-over-quarter reduction in operating income is due to lower gross profit contributions from their mobile mechanical services and energy services division as a result of reductions in revenues as previously mentioned. The improvement in operating margin is due to a better mix of service maintenance and repair activities within the segments, mobile mechanical services division. Our U.S. Industrial Services segment operating income of $3 million represents a decrease of $13.1 million from last year's second quarter operating income of $16 million. Operating margin of a segment for the three months ended June 30 2020 was 1.4%, compared to 5.4% for the three months ended June 30, 2019. The decrease in operating income and operating margin was primarily driven by the reduction in quarter-over-quarter revenues, which resulted from the adverse market conditions mentioned during today's call, as well as significant pricing pressure due to limited shop services opportunities. U.K. Building Services operating income of $5.4 million was essentially flat with 2019 second quarter, as foreign exchange headwinds accounted for the modest period-over-period decline. Operating margin of 5.7% represents an 80 basis point increase over last year, as a result of improved maintenance contract performance as well as the implementation of cost containment measures, which resulted in SG&A expense reductions. We are now on slide nine. Additional financial items of significance for the quarter not addressed on the previous slides are as follows. Quarter two gross profit of $315.3 million is reduced from 2019 second quarter by $31.1 million or 9%. Despite this reduction in gross profit dollars, we did experience an improvement in gross profit as a percentage of revenues with a reported gross margin of 15.7%, which is 80 basis points higher than last year's quarter. As previously mentioned on this call, we had exceptional revenue conversion within our U.S. Mechanical Construction segment, as well as margin expansion within both our U.S. and U.K. Building Services segments. We are reporting a loss per diluted share of $1.52 as compared to earnings per diluted share in last year's second quarter of $1.49. On an adjusted basis after adding back the impairment loss on goodwill, identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is $1.44, as compared to the same report at $1.49 in last year's quarter. This represents a modest reduction of $0.05 or just over 3%. Not to be repetitive in my commentary, but in light of COVID-19 in the economic backdrop we all experienced during the last several months EMCOR has done a great job of maximizing returns were given the opportunity to deliver it services. Please turn to slide 10. With the quarter commentary complete, let's turn our attention to EMCOR's first six-month results. Revenues of $4.31 billion represent a decrease of $169.1 million or 3.8% when compared to revenues of $4.4 8 billion in the corresponding prior year period. Our second quarter revenue declines offset revenue gains posted in quarter one at each of our U.S. Mechanical Construction, U.S. Building Services, U.S. Industrial Services and U.K. Building Services segments, while our U.S. Electrical Construction Services segment has had two consecutive quarters of revenue contraction. Year-to-date gross profit of $648.3 million is lower than the 2019 six-month period by $6.8 million, or a modest 1%. Year-to-date gross margin is 15%, which favorably compares to 2019 year-to-date gross margin of 14.6%. Gross Margin improvement was largely driven by our combined U.S. construction business, as well as our U.K. Building Services segment. Selling general and administrative expenses of $432.2 million for the 2020 six-month period represent 10% of revenues compared to $432.4 million or 9.6% of revenues in 2019. While SG&A for the year-to-date period has decreased nominally from the prior year to substantial cost reduction measures implemented in the second quarter have positioned us at a lower run rate than at this time last year. We reported a loss per diluted share of $0.14 for the six months ended June 30, 2020, which compares to diluted earnings per share of $2.77 in the corresponding 2019 period. Adjusting the results for the current year to exclude the non-cash impairment loss on goodwill identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets resulted in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.78. When comparing this as adjusted number to last year's reported amount $2.77, we are reporting a $0.01 increase. I would like to remind everyone on the call that our performance for the first six months of 2019 set records for most financial metrics with earnings per share in particular, exceeding the prior benchmark by almost 30%. Not to marginalize the sizable impairment charge taken this year, but the fact that on an adjusted basis, we were able to slightly exceed our previous year record. Despite the extraordinary market challenges presented. I believe EMCOR has done quite an exceptional job. My last comment on the slide pertains to EMCOR's income tax rate for 2020. As noted on the slide EMCOR's tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2020 was 59.4%. Our tax rate for the remainder of 2020 will continue to be impacted by the impairment charges recorded during the second quarter, the majority of which were non-deductible for non-GAAP for tax purposes. So with that said at this time our full-year estimated tax rate is between 58% and 59%. However, this can change if any discrete tax events occur during the remainder of the year. We are now on slide 11. I spent some time during our quarter one earnings call detailing enforce liquidity profile. As a reminder, the first quarter historically -- is historically our weakest from a cash generation standpoint, due to funding a prior year earned incentive awards. In addition, 2020's first quarter was negatively impacted by our inability to monetize certain of our first quarter revenue activities, due to delays and customer billings, resulting from our previously communicated ransomware attack. However, as Tony mentioned we had record operating cash flow for the first-half of the year, and as a result of liquidity profile has improved from our already strong position. With strong operating cash flow through June, we have paid down to $200 million revolving credit borrowings outstanding as of March 31, 2020, and our cash on hand has increased to $481.4 million from the approximately $359 million on our year-end 2019 balance sheet. The improvement on operating cash flow was due to excellent working capital management by our subsidiary leadership teams, as well as the benefit with deferral of certain tax payments, due to government measures enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These measures which included the deferral of estimated U.S. federal income tax payments, the employer's portion of Social Security tax payments, and the remission of value-added tax for our U.K. subsidiary have favorably impacted second quarter and year-to-date cash flow by approximately $100 million. Please note that while we will continue to benefit from some of these deferrals throughout the remainder of 2020, our estimated U.S. federal tax payments were funded subsequent to the quarter on July 15th. Changes and additional key balance sheet positions are as follows. Working Capital levels have increased primarily due to the increase in cash just referenced. Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets have decreased since December 31, 2019 largely as a result of the impairment charges previously referenced. In addition intangible assets have decreased as a result of $29.4 million of amortization during the year-to-date period. Stockholder's equity has declined due to the operating loss recognized during the first six months of 2020. EMCOR's debt-to-capitalization ratio of 13.5% is essentially flat, when compared to our position at 2019 year-end, and is reduced from 19.9% at March 31, 2020. We have just over $1.2 billion of availability under our revolving credit line and anticipate that we will continue to generate positive operating cash flow during the last six months of calendar 2020. EMCOR's balance sheet and resulting liquidity position remains strong and we continue to preserve our flexibility and evaluate all market opportunities. With my commentary concluded, I will now turn the call back to Tony, Tony. Yes, and Brent, the other thing is some of the major population centers that were entirely shutdown, we have significant presence on the electrical side. Some of those markets we also have mechanical presence, but more so electrical focus and the inability to be able to have our people either report to our offices for work, or certainly report to any of our customer's locations to perform any of the services was extremely difficult in the quarter, which is why you see the revenue and margin performance. No, there is roughly just over $100 million of goodwill remaining in the Industrial segment post the adjustment. Don't foresee an issue for the remainder of this year, but clearly that the business will have to continue to perform beyond 2021 to continue to support that record evaluation. Thank you. Thanks, Adam. And I think Adam the only other variable is because we certainly experienced a fair amount of delays during quarter two, as much as we are able to control the pacing of the projects that we're on. I'm not quite sure, once we get through these revenue bursts to get caught up with that's going to do in quarter four. So, not all of our projects start on January 1 and end on December 31, as I'm sure everybody in this call knows, but I think with the compression of things that have to get performed between July 1 and December 31 of 2020, you may not see seasonality consistent with what we've experienced on a historical basis. Except for Industrial. Hey, Q3 of '17, it's a while ago on a quarterly basis. Look, I think big picture, I think we'll make money on an EBITDA basis. We've got some goodwill and depreciation to jump over. I think profitability is going to be de-minimis on an operating income basis in the back-half of the year. Greenfield. I think one of the things that will be a little bit of a headwind is we're completing one heck of a food process job right now, and much like we had three years ago, we had a little gap. We may have that again now. We have some very good prospects there. I think that book and build business underneath it is okay. Yes. So, on the only thing I would add to Tony is -- amplified from Tony's commentary is that some of the revenue improvement we're looking at in the back-half of the year is going to be coming from the project work that's going to come off the maintenance because of the season -- the more normal seasonality and while that we are saying, and most of the geographies where we have mechanical services capabilities. And as Tony indicated, a lot of that work actually never actually goes into RPOs, just one of the quick turn nature of it. Conversely because we're looking at revenue to decline from the back-half for the year within our Industrial Services segment, other than the shop piece of that business as you know. That's all our workers time and material, so I never actually impacted the RPO number. So I'm not necessarily convinced that you're going to see the same level of sequential growth. As we move to the third quarter, but I think with all of the opportunities out there and what we are executing again. I would like to say there's going to be no worse than flat, it's not slightly either as we progress through quarter three and quarter four, and putting aside some of those larger projects when we talk about depending on the timing of one, if they are awarded and if they are awarded just when they come in to the next spot. Yes. I think, I see no reason that we are not going to continue to perform at our historical averages and they are really, if you even look at the last 36 months relative to our construction operations on a combined basis. They've been fairly consistent within 50 basis points. So the work that's remaining to be performed in our remaining performance obligations as margin profiles consistent with what you've seen us on, and we were going to continue to operate under our operational excellence program and continue to do what's best for a customer, so..."

            "name": "Tony Guzzi",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Kevin, and I will be addressing pages four through six. Let me first start by thanking our employees for their extraordinary efforts in these continued challenging times. Our performance under these conditions is outstanding. Our organization showed the grit, resiliency, discipline, and innovation that we are known for, and we stayed focus on keeping our employees safe while executing for our customers. Turning to our financial results, throughout our discussion all my financial commentary disregards the impact of the impairment charge that Mark will cover in detail. We earned an adjusted $1.44 diluted share for the second quarter. Adjusted operating income margins for the second quarter were a strong 5.47%. Operating cash flow is excellent at $276 million on a year-to-date basis. We accomplished this in an environment where we had 15.5% negative organic revenue growth for the quarter just ended. Our Mechanical Construction segment performance was exceptional with operating income growth of 24% and 8.5% operating income margins. Our Electrical Construction segment had strong operating income margins of 7.2%, despite having a 21.7% decrease in revenues as they were more significantly impacted by the mandated shutdowns than our Mechanical Construction segment was, and further, the Electrical Construction segment is more exposed to the volatility caused by oil and gas exposure in this segment. Our U.S. Building Services segment had a very strong quarter with 5.6% operating income margins, despite a 9.8% revenue decrease. We saw demand improved through the quarter, especially in our mechanical services and government services businesses. We exited the quarter in a nice, hot, steamy summer with an even more competitive cost structure. Our Industrial Services segment is also moving ahead in a very challenged market. Our customers are cutting cost, deferring work, and fighting through a really tough market for them, and as a result, for us. We will continue to maximize any opportunity available, cut cost, and look to write flexible solutions when possible. I don't anticipate this strength to improve until at least the first quarter of 2021 at the earliest. We are fortunate to be a segment leader, and have longstanding relationships with the most important customers in the downstream refining and petrochemical markets. Our U.K. segment had a strong quarter, and we expect this execution and performance to continue. They face many of the same challenges that our U.S. Building Services segment faced. However, our U.K. customer base is more institutional, manufacturing, and government-focused, and as a result, we are stable [indiscernible] employments throughout the U.K. shutdown as we were deemed essential in many cases. So, how did we continue performing in this environment, and how will we continue to perform? My comments cut across all EMCOR reporting segments. We outlined some of these actions on our first quarter call in April, and we executed well. So, number one, we focused on employee safety first, and as a result, we were able to staff job safely and with the right people. Said differently, our people had confidence that we would do the right thing. We implemented guidelines to keep operating, and when necessary to reopen. We aggressively procured the PPE, that's the Personal Protective Equipment, upfront that our employees needed to keep working, and we executed the training necessary to work safely in this environment. We communicated at all levels with a focus on safety, execution, and results. Our flat organizational structure helped our communications remain effective, and unhampered, despite COVID-related challenges. Number two, we thoroughly and quickly implemented all the different government mandates and programs with respect to COVID. Our staff did a superb job in distilling these mandates and programs into specific actions for our subsidiary operations to continue operating productively and safely, and in compliance with these varied government mandates. Number three, we aggressively cut SG&A through both the short and long-term measures. We cut executive pay 25% in the quarter, cut other salary employees pay in the quarter, furloughed staff, permanent laid-off salary staff, cut almost all travel and entertainment expenses, and reduced any additional discretionary expenses. We reduced $21 million in the quarter versus the year-ago period, and when removing incremental SG&A for businesses acquired, we cut $28 million on an organic basis. I expect about half of those cuts to be permanent. We acted fast and decisively, and it shows in our results. Further, we aggressively right-sized our craft labor workforce to match demand through layoffs and furloughs. Number four, we knew we had to comp out what would be reduced productivity, because of increased use of PPE, and the implementation of other COVID-related safety measures. We have successfully combined to this challenge, and met this challenge by working with our customers and our workforce to offer better scheduling, planning, and work practices. We believe for the most part that we are near breakeven on a productivity basis to where we would have been pre-COVID. Number five, we trained our field and sales force on IAQ, that is, Indoor Air Quality; and other building enhancements products and projects during the initial phases of COVID, so we would be ready to provide solutions for our customers to be able to return to their facilities with confidence and in an improved indoor environment. Number six, our subsidiary leaders led us well as any organization that I could imagine. I'll say that again, our subsidiary leaders led us well as any organization that I could imagine, and they executed all the above initiatives I just mentioned in an exceptional manner. With all that said, we leave the quarter with a strong RPO position of $4.6 billion, our balance sheet stripping through the quarter, despite adverse conditions, and an even more competitive cost structure than we already had. With all that said, I will turn the discussion over to Mark. Thanks, Mark, and I'm on page 12 remaining performance obligation by segment and market sector. In short, we continue to work and have seen our small productivity improved for the second quarter, as it hit a low point in April for bookings and execution, some comparisons to consider. Total RPOs at the end of the second quarter, were just about $4.6 billion, up $365 billion or 8.6%, when compared to the June 2019 level of $4.23 billion. RPOs also increased a $160 7 million from the first quarter of 2020 reflectivity continued demand, as we are seeing for market -- continued demand we are seeing for our services and our markets. So, for the first six months of 2020, total RPOs increased $555 million or 13.8% from December 31. With all this growth, only $11 million relates to a tuck-in acquisition, so almost all that growth is organic. Domestic RPOs have increased $346 million or 8.4% just a year ago period drive mainly by our Mechanical Construction segment. We did run through some electrical construction project as we completed some complex work. However, we expect to backfill these projects, as we continue to see demand, especially in the high-tech and data market and high-tech for us means semiconductor and the datacenter market. Our U.S. Building Services segment RPOs dipped a little in the quarter as the segments project work was first impacted by COVID-19 building access delays and decision-making. As the economy opens up, combined with the hotter weather, we are getting more access to facilities and seeing the resumption of our work. Additionally, both of our Industrial services in EMCOR U.K. segments increased RPO level by roughly 15%, respectively from June 30, 2019. On the right side of the page we have on 12 we show RPOs by market sector. Of the eight market sectors listed all had year-over-year RPO increases except for manufacturing and industrial. This is not to be confused with our Industrial segment. Currently we're in the process of competing some major food processing projects. We continue to see demand for these large complicated projects, and have a number of potential opportunities we are looking at. Commercial project RPOs comprised our largest sector -- market sector that were 40% of the total. This is had 19% increase from year-end referred via our data center projects, and as we've said before, we are uniquely suited for these fast paced, especially in the hyper scale projects from both in electrical and mechanical perspective. Other very active markets for us are healthcare, water, and wastewater, with these sectors being up 25% and 49% respectively, from year-end 2019. Today, we have not seen any material slowdown in bidding opportunities, apart from the mandated areas that was New York, New Jersey, Boston and parts of California and a little bit in Pennsylvania. However, these areas are now open. As I said earlier, the industry has adapted safety -- safe work practices and protocols to keep project progressing, and especially to keep workers safe. Finally, we are positioned very well to help our customers as they adjust their HVAC in building, control systems to improve the IQ, and cleanliness of their buildings and other facilities. It starts with the introduction of more outside air into the space as one of the simplest ways to make a building healthier, but unfortunately, this makes the building less efficient. We have strong experience in IQ systems and our service companies and mechanical contractors know how to implement UV lights; bipolar ionization, enhanced filtering, and control system modifications. Most of this work will never make it into reported RPOs from a quarter-to-quarter basis and it is quick turn, high margin activity. Together, it will mount to a nice media -- medium sized project with good margins. I do expect these IQ additions to longer terms for a more robust HVAC replacement market, as we seek to increase efficiency to combat the increase in IAQ, especially the introduction of outside air. So, as I said in our first quarter call, I don't know exactly how all the works specifically we will roll out, and how that booking will be, it's a fluid and challenging environment. There will be bumps along the way. However, the direction of future opportunities for a contractor like us remains pointed in a positive direction. So now I'm going to close on pages 13 to 14. When we went through guidance in April, we said we had hoped that we could provide a view on the outlook for the remainder of the year during the second quarter earnings call. We have spent the last few weeks debating internally whether to provide more definitive versus generic guidance for the remainder of the year. We have decided to provide more specific guidance with some caveats, which mostly deal with the external environment. The main caveat is we expect operating conditions to remain similar to -- as to today's operating conditions where most of the country is opened for our type of work. And we are deemed in essential activity. So we decided to give guidance as to the why and what as outlined below. Subject to that main caveat, we're likely going to earn $5 to $5.50 diluted earnings per share this year on an adjusted basis adding back the impact of impairment. I think revenues will likely be $8.6 billion to $8.7 billion. In this revenue guidance, it is our expectation from our recent forecast, where we believe that all of our reporting segments will grow revenues in the second-half of the year versus the first-half of the year, except for our Industrial Services segment. We now understand how COVID-19 has impacted our productivity. We are seeing stabilization a small project work, and the summer heat is helping our U.S. Building Services segment, we have a strong RPO position, and we see markets recovering, especially in our mechanical, Electrical Construction segments, and in our U.S. and U.K. Building Services segments. So, how do you move up in this range largely will depend on three factors. The external marker remains largely same or even improved from today's operating environment. Under today's conditions, we can book and execute work, keep our workforce productive, and we believe we will continue to see the recovery in the small project work. You know if the Industrial Services segment folks have an opportunity to help customers in an unexpected way, then we will perform slightly better than expected, and we have no major project disruptions or any new significant customer bankruptcies. So, as far as capital allocation, the dividend is safe for the foreseeable future, however we're unlikely to make any more share repurchase in the near-term. We will look to execute accessible tuck-in acquisitions where we have decent visibility into and belief in the long-term success of the acquisition. That's really no different than any time we buy a company, and we based on the business, the market and the improvements we can make, we have several potential mechanical or Electrical Construction segment acquisitions and are in the preliminary stage of discussion on several mechanical services, a few small ones and Fire Protection acquisitions that we will likely execute. Thanks for all your support during these challenging times, and with that, I'll take questions. Lara? Good morning, Brent. Thanks. Yes, look I think the core of our electrical business, which is commercial construction and institutional construction, and healthcare construction to continue to be fine and look like the mechanical business. In the electrical business that's a little bit different is we have a position in oil and gas. If you'll remember that's where four years ago we bought Ardent and Rabalais, it's in that segment. Ardent had a terrific year last year, and we will fight through those headwinds in the back-half of the year. Mark, anything? Yes, the base business obviously is performing very well at 7.2% operating income margins, and we've had terrific performance really across the country, and like Mark said, they had to fight through the head end of shutdowns, but it will have overcome the compare on the back-half of the year in the oil and gas business. Yes, we marginally have -- look, first of all, in manpower we would use is the trade labor, and that's flexible anyway. We have used some of the trade labor to help us augment especially on the electrical side, some surging capacity we had on both the manufacturing and datacenter side, but that then normalizes. I wouldn't say to any significant manner, no. Thanks, Brent. Thank you. Yes, I mean the headwind, I mean clearly reflected in our guidance is how we see seasonality playing out, and as I said, we see stronger second-half revenues versus first-half for our reporting segments, except for Industrial, but typically, Industrial typically has a good third quarter and even first part of fourth quarter. So, we don't see that happening this year. I think for the remaining reporting segments, as long as we sort of have the operating conditions we have now, seasonality should be about what it is. Mark, am I right? Except for Industrial. I don't know if I've seen it do $140 million in revenue... On a quarterly basis. We have taken annual. I have no idea right now. I mean one of the challenges we've had in that business over the last couple of years is the first quarter is always going to be better, right, and quite frankly, the last two have been okay. And this year was shaping up to be a good year. So, the question is going to be, let's say, we start seeing resumption of air travel, resumption of demand as you go from December, January, and February. What does that mean for refiner decision-making is maintenance. Are they going to keep running because they're finally making money again, and starting to get to better capacity utilization, or are they going to go through scheduled maintenance? Sitting here today, I don't really have any visibility on that. On the books, first quarter 2021 looks okay, but I think, boy, we're going to have to really see December before we know that. Well, first of all, we're a [laggard], [ph] right, I mean we would be bidding on projects probably more [indiscernible] with an ABI in February, March. The second thing is I think it depends where and how you're competing. I've always sort of with the ABIs wrong, right, it's consistently right or consistently wrong, it's self-reported numbers. My gut, I'm not sure how that was, if I were running my architectural firm or engineering firm in the month of April and May, I'm not sure how I reported numbers with a dispersed workforce to the -- AIA would have been at the top of my list. Thanks, Adam. Yes, we never think about that. Well, it's just sort of something that has ever been on our radar screen. This is a big, big market. We are the biggest of what we do, but there is a lot of competitors out there. I never sit around and worry about who is going to succeed and who is going to fail. Contractors -- there is a wonderful thing about this business, right, when things are well, we talk about contractors overextending themselves and running into working capital problems. When things are bad, we talk about contractors taking bad work, and then failing. Here is what I've learned over a long period of time. [Indiscernible] to what you do to convey to make money on the market that's available to you to make money, grow when it's responsible to grow in that local market, shrink when you need to adjust your cost structure, and never count on your competitors making a good decision in a changing market. All that being said, I don't think there will be a lot of contractors that are sizeable that say that $15 million to $20 million contractor that will necessarily fell in this market because of the PPP loans. I think they will survive, and the question is, what does that look like a year from now? So, we tend to look through the cycle. We closed an acquisition today in our Building Services segment to augment and strengthen our Mechanical Services segment. It's a very good mechanicals contractor that focuses on retrofit and the interiors market. We have a pretty good service company there that we think long-term together, they'll be dynamite. Of course, we have large project capability on the mechanical side with our [indiscernible]. So this is a nice fit, and an important market with a company that we've known for a long time, and we can sort of look through the cycle and look through the market into performance, and it is performing very well. And we look at -- when we make a deal, we always try to look at a deal to say does this work for us, and does it work for the person selling the company. We don't want to be known as the people that are out there looking for a bargain, and if that acquisition exceeds our expectations, it became from superior execution, our ability to generate synergies especially on the revenue side for them to take more risks than they would have typically they have the capability that maybe they didn't want to expand their personal balance sheet to do that. I think there will be opportunities, but EMCOR in general does not look for distressed assets. We made it a few times in our past maybe we've ended up with them, but it wasn't intentional, and so, we're going to keep the tried and true thing we've done, look at the market, look at the position in the market of the person we're thinking of buying. If it's a very small acquisition, is it going to tuck into one of our larger acquisition-driven medium size acquisition to our larger subsidiaries, that's largely how we've built the fire protection business with two anchor acquisitions overtime and many, many years ago, and look to generate the right kind of synergies on the revenue side. And of course, do the cost takeout were responsible. Let's start big picture. I don't know what will happen in on non-res, and how what happened in second quarter will impact the overall numbers. You know whether it will be up or down once you correct for the second quarter. If the second quarter didn't have such an anomaly, maybe it would be down a little bit, but I don't know that, but with the second quarter being off as much, it could actually be up a little bit right on a real basis year-to-year. When I think about it, you know, what's likely to be challenged, right? I think just flat out commercial office space will be challenged except for maybe the renovation and the potential retrofit and replacement market. I don't think there will be a lot of new construction going on, although there are several projects that were involved with, I think will get built. It's funny, when I went back and looked at data, as we got rid of for the first quarter column today. We haven't been involved in a high rise commercial office building in any substantial way for four years. Yes, yes, Greenfield, yes, Mark, thanks, Greenfield. We are always doing retrofit work. We're always doing tenant fit work. So I think the Greenfield market will be more challenged. I think residential high rise was already starting to become challenged. I think that will continue to be challenged. I think anything around technology is going to do well. And that includes build office space. I don't think we're going to walk away from working in offices forever. I think it'll be a hybrid model, and that will require reconfiguration of spaces. And I'm not sure if people are going to be as excited about their open Office plans as they have in the future, because most people want to have contingency plans to operate much like we are today in our offices. I think that the healthcare market will have some stress for us potentially, as you see in our backlog, because spaces are going to be adjusted, and there're some big projects out there that we're looking at today. I think that the manufacturing/industrial for us potentially could get strong. It's going to look like an anomaly for a while, as our big food processors jobs move in and out. I think that will continue to be a market that will be strong for us. I'm actually fairly significant believer in onshore, and I think we're starting to see that happen. We've seen it over the last couple years, but I think it's not only going to be from China back to the U.S. I think there will be a challenge for Mexico to attract new business, and people build redundant supply here in the U.S. versus Mexico, because the [Maquiladora] [ph] story was a tough story. We hear from some of our customers and supply lines here in the second quarter with COVID, and they found how difficult it could be operate with the current government. I think that the institutional market will be a little bit slower than I think it will pick up as buildings get reconfigured. And in the education market, again, you're going to have to think about IAQ, IAQ then drive efficiency. And so this whole replacement market where we support, we do a little bit ourselves in a couple states, but for the most part, we support the heck out of the performance contractors. They could in fact see an uptick in their business late '21 going into '22. I think water and wastewater will continue to be a good market for us mainly because of we have location, location, location, a lot going on down in South Florida, and will be part of that. I don't think that hospitality will be a real area of strength for anybody here anytime soon. In fact, we can argue here at EMCOR we maybe just start blending out with our commercial sector. We just leave it off there for comparison sake. Is that helpful? Thank you. I'll let Mark jump in here too. Where I look at it is, it depends. We have several projects we're looking at that they get awarded in a rather significant, than you won't see that. We've also seen more stability in the small project activity. That is now part of our RPOs, so you'll look back many years that wouldn't have been necessarily in there. Yes, that could happen, but I don't think it's long-term yet. Our working assumption with EMCOR has been for a while that things don't get really normal until first quarter of '21, and we've been sort of configuring our business and working that way for a while. So, we're sort of looking around all those pieces. Mark? I would go to latter, not the former. I don't think 8.5% mechanical margin is sustainable for extended period of time. I think, we've had these in the past where they jump in and out, we always say look back 12 months, and that gives you every three or four quarters, it gives you a pretty good idea, how we're performing. We've said for a long time anywhere from 6% to 7.5% mechanically is pretty good performance. I guess we ticked that up to 6.5% mechanically, which is pretty good as a baseline to seven. Anyhow maybe 7.5%, we are finishing jobs. These are going better than expected. Electrically, we've been performing at these levels for a long time, those sectors are led by people that really know how to cut cost when they need to, not, how to meter back in the cost, a lot of it happens upfront, right? We don't have big write-offs typically, may be we have them every three or four years. Usually, most of it's not our fault, and we do a pretty good job recovery sometimes. A third at any given time might be our fault, and so, we do a good job, avoiding badness. I always say margins are driven by and absence of that is an executing or good work when you have it. So that funnel upfront is very important and we have been very careful right now, on the kind of job we're selecting, and at the beginning of this COVID thing, people were like getting a little desperate, we then participate, and we've seen more normal fitting resume. So yes, longwinded answer to normalize margins, these are a little high right now for mechanical, but you know, I look back 12 months we are doing okay. Mark? Yes, we didn't believe that, we would have put the guidance out that we did, right, I mean, and our major question mark in the back-half of the year really centers around Industrial, and maybe to a much lesser extent, as small project work, and Mark went through why we believe that will keep going at much lesser extent than what could happen with small project only because it's the valve they can turn on and off. Not anything we are actually seeing today. Just if things are really bad like that they did in April that valve we will turn off again. And we said that in our guidance, that's one of the caveats. Thank you. Hey, Joe. Yes, I would break it into two pieces, Joe. The first piece is what you are doing today to take existing systems and making more friendly for better indoor environment. I think when you add all that up at EMCOR, it will be a nice project, it will be a -- altogether, it will be a sort of $12 million to $20 million project with above average margins. These things are going to happen somewhere between $2 and $10,000 at a time, maybe $20 at the top under typical 100,000 square foot of space. That's sort of what they are. However, the longer term opportunity is okay, we need what we needed to do with the system we had. Now, how do we make sure that we have a better built space for the long-term? We do a lot of this on newer building. So, you are going to have to update the HVAC system and the control system because IAQ for the most part -- the biggest part of it is bringing in more outside air. I mean that's the first thing you could do, and it's actually one of the most effective things you can do. That works across purposes with efficiency. So, I believe that as you play this out over a two-year period, you are going to see the replacement market get stronger going from in the middle '21 and beyond. And it's already a pretty good replacement market because equipment is so much more variable and efficient today than it was even just 10 years ago. So, I think that's a second phase you will see. And then, I think of course, there will be added HVAC content and controls content in new builds. We are already seeing that, but you will see even more of that, and any of you, if you can go to a specific case, I think when you get to the healthcare space, now that we have had this issue around ICU beds, where ICUs are in general are built to operate [indiscernible] 90% of the capacity all the time. They are very expensive. So, I think as you build new hospitals and retrofit hospitals, I think you are going to be putting in the ability to flex into more ICU space. And so, how do you do that? You introduce negative pressure, right, which creates negative pressure than ICU room. You will put the more the systems into a room and they may or not be used until you need them. So that's going to be an opportunity that's going to happen. So, IAQ is a simple thing to say, it takes all kind of different flavors; existing, today, immediate, I can do things. I can put UV lights on. I can do enhanced filtering. I can do bipolar ionization. I can increase the airflow from outside. Long-term, I can do all kind of things with a system. Those things and more, but they could be actually built in into the system. In the longer term, how do I make my space as flexible as I can either in industrial setting and office setting, or in healthcare setting, so I can adjust between different kinds of uses depending on something like this potentially happening again. Yes I think '21, it'll add on to an already good summer. I mean in '20. I think as you get mid '21 and beyond and things start getting incorporated designed, it will be more material. You won't necessarily see. You will just know you are doing more HVAC [count] [ph] in a building, or you'll see a more rapid replacement cycle. Things get replaced to 10 or 12 years instead of 15 to 20. Yes, about half it will. In my commentary, I said I think about half of these cost reductions will be permanent. Yes, we did. We said $21 million actual versus the year-ago period, $28 million organic. So, I think if you do that, you would say we are picking up about $10 million a quarter give or take in ongoing cost reduction. No, that was -- look, [everything] [ph] is slowing in our res space, if you have the right capability in the right market via larger contractors you can generate a positive result on your RPOs because of large projects. That is in fact what happened with our larger companies in the mechanical space. We have two or three of them that really had nice bookings in the quarter. I didn't say the rest of the year. I said in the near term and that probably for us means Q3 as of today. We expect - look along those lines, if you take our long-term view of the world and we get into a more normalized operating condition, we expect to be a balanced capital allocator like we have always have been. Thank you, Joe. Okay. Look, as I finish today, I really want to thank our employees and then the leaders of the -- of our associates and our employees. This has been an unprecedented four or five months here. And everybody has just put their head down, gone to work, kept focus on our employee safety, kept focus on doing right things by our employees first the best that we could, and then focused on delivering results for our customers and keeping things on track. It's been a terrific effort by our leadership team and has been very, very exceptional effort for our broader employee base. I think this is going to continue for the next four or five months, and I know that our team will meet the challenge and we will respond to what we need to respond to keep the organization moving forward in a positive manner. So, I am going to thank all of them first and thank our customers and of course our investors also. And we will continue to try and do everything we can to deliver good results for you. With that, thanks."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the EMCOR Group First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Ms. Jamie Baird with FTI Consulting, you may begin.\nJamie Baird: Thank you, Lara, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the EMCOR Group Conference Call. We are here today to discuss the company's 2020 first quarter results, which were reported this morning. I would now like to turn the call over to Kevin Matz, Executive Vice President of Shared Services, who will introduce management. Kevin, please go ahead.\nKevin Matz: Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for your interest in EMCOR. As we start, let me simply and briefly say, I hope you and your families are well and staying safe as we move through this unprecedented time. For those of you who are accessing the call via our Internet and our website, welcome, and we hope you have arrived at the beginning of our slide presentation that will accompany our remarks today. We are on Slide 2. This presentation and discussion contains certain forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial information. Page two describes in detail the forward-looking statements and the non-GAAP financial disclosures. I encourage everyone to review both disclosures in conjunction with our discussion and accompanying slides. Slide 3 depicts the executives who are with me to discuss the quarter's results. They are Tony Guzzi, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Pompa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and our Senior Vice President and General Counsel, Maxine Mauricio. For call participants not accessing the conference call via the Internet, this presentation, including the slides, will be archived in the Investor Relations section of our website under Presentations. You can find us at emcorgroup.com. With that being said, please let me turn the call over to Tony. Tony?\nAnthony Guzzi: Yes. Thanks, Kevin. And I'm going to be on Pages four through six. As we have already released preliminary results, I am not going to speak that much to the first quarter of 2020. Mark will. I will cover some of the highlights, and Mark will speak to the detailed results. And then I will end with an overview of what we are seeing in the marketplace today. Even when faced with significant obstacles, we had a record quarter. We set first quarter records for revenues, gross profit, gross margin, operating income and diluted earnings per share from continuing operation. The entire EMCOR organization has responded well to this COVID-19 crisis. I thank our leadership and all of our employees for focusing first on our employees' health and safety, and I also thank them for keeping focus on our business during these challenging times. We have a company values of mission first, people always. We train those values, we hire on those values, and we promote our team on those values. It serves us well in these challenging times. I will quickly summarize some highlights for the quarter. Our Mechanical and Electrical Construction segments had a very strong quarter, led by our work in data centers, health care and food processing. We had a particularly strong booking quarter in these segments. Our Building Services segment had the most disruption in the first quarter from COVID-19 as our owner customers started to limit access for our HVAC technicians and our commercial site-based businesses. However, we executed very well until mid-March, and our project execution was very strong, and we booked some very nice retrofit and energy savings projects. Our Industrial Services segment had a very good quarter despite a challenging end market. We had strengthened our field operations and executed several large turnarounds. Some of our work was pushed from mid-March until later in the second quarter or the results would have even been better. Our U.K. segment had a terrific quarter. We leave the quarter with a strong and liquid balance sheet, record Remaining Performance Obligations or RPOs and a business that still has opportunities to operate in this unprecedented environment. We are well positioned to continue serving our markets and our customers in an expanded way when normalized operations resume. With that, I will turn it over to Mark to discuss the quarter in more detail.\nMark Pompa: Thank you, Tony, and good morning to everyone on the call today. For those accessing this presentation via the webcast, we are now on Slide 7. Over the next several slides, I will augment Tony's opening commentary and review each of our reportable segments' first quarter operating performance, as well as other chief financial data derived from our consolidated financial statements included in both our earnings release announcement and Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier today. So, let's expand our review of EMCOR's first quarter performance. Consolidated revenues of $2.3 billion are up $141.1 million or 6.5% over quarter one 2019. Our first quarter results include $82.5 million of revenues attributable to businesses acquired pertaining to the period of time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in last year's first quarter. Acquisition revenues positively impacted each of our United States Electrical Construction, United States Mechanical Construction and United States Building Services segments. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired, first quarter consolidated revenues increased approximately $58.6 million or 2.7%. All of EMCOR's reportable segments other than our United States Electrical Construction segment reported revenue growth during the first quarter of 2020. United States Electrical Construction revenues of $525.2 million decreased $2.8 million or approximately 0.5% from 2019's first quarter. Excluding acquisition revenues of $25.4 million, this segment's quarterly revenues declined 5.3% organically quarter-over-quarter. Revenue declines within the commercial, transportation, water and hospitality market sectors due to the completion of certain projects during 2019, were partially offset by increased project revenues within the manufacturing, institutional and health care market sectors. United States Mechanical Construction revenues of $834.1 million increased $81.7 million or 10.9% from quarter one 2019. Excluding acquisition revenues of $55.5 million, this segment's revenues grew organically 3.5% quarter-over-quarter. Revenue growth was primarily attributable to an increase in revenues from manufacturing, health care, transportation and institutional projects. These revenue gains were partially offset by contractions in project activity within the commercial, hospitality and water market sectors. First quarter revenues for EMCOR's total domestic construction business of $1.36 billion increased $78.9 million or 6.2%. As Tony will cover later during this presentation, our combined United States construction business has experienced growth, both sequentially and year-over-year in the Remaining Performance Obligations through March 31. United States Building Services quarterly revenues of $518.1 million, increased $6 million or just over 1%, the majority of which was attributable to organic activities. Revenue gains within the segment's mechanical services division were substantially offset by quarter-over-quarter revenue declines within each of their commercial site-based energy and government services divisions. United States Industrial Services revenues of $310 million increased $51.4 million or 19.9% as a result of higher field services activities as we executed a fairly strong spring turnaround schedule when compared to the prior year. Offsetting the quarter-over-quarter revenue growth was a decline in this segment's shop services revenues due to a reduction in new build heat exchanger sales. United Kingdom Building Services revenues of $112.4 million increased $4.8 million or 4.5% due to incremental revenues from new maintenance contracts as well as continued project and repair activity across their customer portfolio. Quarterly revenue growth was hindered by $2.2 million of foreign exchange headwinds. Please turn to Slide 8. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $227 million represent 9.9% of first quarter revenues and reflect an increase of $20.8 million from quarter one 2019. SG&A for the first quarter of 2020 includes approximately $9 million of incremental expenses from businesses acquired, inclusive of intangible asset amortization, resulting in an organic quarter-over-quarter increase of approximately $11.8 million. This organic increase is primarily due to higher employment costs as a result of increased headcount to support our pre-COVID-19 revenue growth expectations as well as incremental expense for credit losses within the quarter. This incremental expense compares unfavorably to 2019's first quarter, which included a recovery of credit losses or bad debts that have been previously written off. In addition, the first quarter of 2019 benefited from a favorable legal settlement within our Industrial Services segment, which was recorded as a reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses. The current year increases were partially offset by a reduction in incentive compensation expense year-over-year. Reported operating income for the quarter of $106 million represents 4.6% of revenues and compares to $102.3 million or 4.7% of revenues in 2019's first quarter. This performance represents a $3.7 million increase or 3.6% period-over-period. Our U.S. Electrical Construction Services segment operating income of $43.9 million increased approximately $1 million from the comparable 2019 period. Reported operating margin of 8.4% represents a 30 basis point improvement over last year's first quarter. The increase in this segment's operating income is primarily due to incremental contribution from a business acquired in 2019. The improvement in operating margin, however, is due to favorable project execution, inclusive of project closeouts within the quarter. First quarter operating income of our U.S. Mechanical Construction Services segment of $45.2 million represents a $4.2 million increase from 2019. Operating margin of 5.4% is consistent year-over-year. The increase in the segment's operating income is partially attributable to the incremental contribution from businesses acquired as well as increased gross profit from organic activities within the manufacturing market sector. Our total U.S. construction business is reporting $89.1 million of operating income and a 6.6% operating margin. This performance has improved by $5.1 million or 6.1% from 2019's first quarter. Operating income for U.S. Building Services of $20.8 million represents 4% of revenues and is a $6.6 million reduction from last year's first quarter. Operating margin decreased by 140 basis points. The quarter-over-quarter reduction in operating income is due to lower gross profit from the segment's commercial site-based services division as a result of the reduction in snow removal revenues as well as a decline in gross profit within their energy services division due to a decrease in large project activity, given the substantial completion of certain projects in 2019. Additionally, the reduction in operating margin quarter-over-quarter is due to the under absorption of certain overhead costs in those divisions that experienced revenue declines as well as an increase in the provision for credit losses within this segment as compared to 2019's first quarter, which benefited from the recovery of certain receivables, which had been previously written off. Our U.S. Industrial Services segment is reporting operating income of $12.3 million or 4% of revenues. The previously referenced quarter-over-quarter growth in field services activities resulted in an improvement in both operating income and operating margin when compared to 2019's corresponding period. U.K. Building Services operating income of $5.8 million represents 5.1% of revenues, which is an improvement of $1.6 million and 120 basis points of operating margin expansion over 2019's first quarter. Our EMCOR U.K. team continues to do an excellent job of fostering new maintenance customer relationships and executing follow-on repair and project services while maintaining a disciplined cost structure. We are now on Slide 9. Additional financial items of significance for the quarter not addressed on my previous slides are as follows: quarter one gross profit of $333.1 million represents 14.5% of revenues, which has improved from the comparable 2019 quarter by $24.3 million and 20 basis points of gross margin. The increase in consolidated gross profit is a result of increases across all our reportable segments, other than U.S. Building Services, while the gross margin improvement is due to continued excellence in project execution, primarily within our United States construction segments. Diluted earnings per common share was $1.35 as compared to $1.28 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2019. This represents a 5.5% improvement quarter-over-quarter. We are now on Slide 10. I will address EMCOR's liquidity profile directly a little later in this morning's call. But as you can see on this slide, our balance sheet continues to maintain its strength. Cash on hand is slightly down from year-end 2019 as a result of cash used in operations, primarily due to the funding of 2019's company-wide incentive compensation awards. Additionally, with respect to cash used in financing activities, we repurchased approximately $99 million of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program. These uses of cash were offset by incremental borrowings of $192.5 million under our amended and extended credit facility during the quarter. Working capital levels have increased due to our organic revenue growth as well as an increase in accounts receivable and a corresponding decrease in net contract liabilities related to certain delays in customer billings resulting from the RYUK ransomware attack we disclosed in connection with our 2019 year-end earnings call and Form 10-K filing. We are currently caught up with our transaction processing, however, that does not necessarily translate to quicker turnaround when it comes to payment from our customers. The increase in goodwill is due to the business acquired during the first quarter within our U.S. Building Services segment. Net identifiable intangible assets decreased as a result of $14.7 million of intangible asset amortization, partially offset by the impact of additional intangible assets recognized in connection with the previously referenced 2020 acquisition. Total debt, excluding operating lease liabilities, is approximately $505 million and represents an increase of $192.3 million from year-end 2019. As a result of our outstanding borrowings, we had a debt to capitalization ratio of 19.9% as compared to 13.2% at December 31, 2019. As I mentioned earlier, I will cover EMCOR's liquidity in greater depth later in this morning's presentation after I turn the call back to Tony. Tony?\nAnthony Guzzi: Thanks, Mark, and I'm on Page 11, which I will cover Remaining Performance Obligations by segment and market sector. As stated earlier, we had a strong bookings quarter. Total RPOs at the end of the first quarter were $4.42 billion, up $267 million or 6.4% when compared to the March 2019 level of $4.16 billion. In fact, this RPO total is the highest quarterly total reported since we initiated RPO reporting in March 2018 and higher than any backlog level we reported prior to that. Domestic RPOs have increased $284 million or 7.1% since the year ago period, driven mainly by our Mechanical Construction segment. We did close a few strategic mechanical construction acquisitions in 2019, which helped support that growth. Book-to-bill measuring first quarter 2020 RPO activity over year-end 2019 activity was close to 1.2, which is fairly strong performance considering the strong first quarter revenues of $2.3 billion. So from the end of 2019, total RPOs increased $388 million or 9.6%. On the right side of the page, we show RPOs by market sector. $1.8 billion of this is classified as projects in the commercial sector. We view this sector broadly and beyond office and financial facilities. This sector also includes high-tech and data center projects that we continue to bid and construct. We are building these highly complex, fast-paced data center projects for the largest Internet and data storage providers. And while there are certain dense geographies for data center construction, like the Mid-Atlantic and the Pacific Northwest, where we have industry-leading expertise in our Dyna Washington, Poole and Kent North and Dyna Oregon companies, we are also seeing other areas of the country where data center construction is building up for the large providers. EMCOR companies are uniquely suited to do this work in other parts of the country as well. Two such areas are in Dallas and Iowa, where in the last 18 months or so, we have made electrical construction and service acquisitions investments to address growth in these geographic areas. Also, last November, we announced the acquisition of Batchelor & Kimball, or BKI. This terrific Atlanta-based full-service mechanical contractor is a nationwide leader in constructing large, complex construction projects, including data centers, with a strong performance record for data centers in the broader Southeast and Oklahoma. Additionally, BKI also is a leading provider of health care facilities, another market sector that saw RPO growth in the year-over-year and first three months of 2020. Before I leave here, because I know you're going to ask, I want to address a certain question. Yes, we have performed several projects across the country either to support the Corp of Engineers, municipalities or our health care provider customers. And what we're doing is expanding or retrofitting facilities to allow for the better treatment of COVID-19 patients. This work was, for the most part, being executed on a time and material basis. Therefore, it's, for the most part, not included in RPOs. In the aggregate, while this work is incredibly important to support our customers, this work has not substantially impacted our results. In summary, all I can say is that the current bidding environment is still active in most areas in the countries, and I'll speak to that in a moment. And while it is very rare the projects that we are working on get canceled, there is going to be a certain degree of uncertainty with respect to the rollout of this work in this fluid environment that we are operating in at this time. And now I'm going to go to Pages 12 and 13, and I'm going to talk about what the external environment looks like and what the internal environment that we're dealing with looks like. As I think about our business, I again rely on what has always been our operating philosophy at EMCOR. You only can control what you can control, and you have to react to the macro disruptions and problems in a disciplined and process-oriented manner. We will keep our focus on our core values of mission first, people always. We know that we create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders by focusing on our task at hand and maintaining the discipline that has served us so well in good and bad markets. And in markets like the one in which we are currently operating that have changed very abruptly, we must keep executing our mission for our customers, but we must also keep our employees safe, which is one of our core values. Fortunately, it is in our DNA to have robust contingency plans that focus not only on opportunity capture in any market, but also resiliency to react to markets and job site conditions that change for better or worse. And as contracts, markets, job sites and the overall environment changes, we are used to adjusting to changes in those conditions and know how to pivot responsibly and appropriately on very short notice. So first, let's discuss the operating environment, the external operating environment that we are operating in. In many cases, we are still operating full force as we are deemed an essential business in many states and cities. However, this changes to the plus or minus every day. Boston, New York City, New Jersey, parts of the San Francisco Bay Area and Pennsylvania, all are under work stoppage or EMCOR's project and service work are not deemed essential. However, even in those places, we are still operating at 25% to 30% of capacity as that work is deemed essential. Our small project work and technician-based businesses have been the most impacted of our United States businesses. Customers have shut much of this down, but I do not expect this shutdown will continue as a lot of this work is needed service for summer start up and required maintenance, replacement and repair work. And always keep in mind that we do not determine whether a project is stop or a service site is closed. Our owner, general contractor, construction manager and EPC contractor customers determine that, and we respond accordingly. The oil war and now the oil glut, emanating from significantly reduced demand, is ongoing and having an impact on our oil and gas customers. This affects both our more limited upstream business where the impact has been most significant to our much larger downstream business, where there has been less of an impact to date. When you talk about how we get supplies, right, to do our job, supply disruption may also happen as manufacturers and/or distributors are forced to close plants in certain states and/or countries as those plant personnel are quarantined or facilities are closed for cleaning or the government decides that facility is not essential. To date, we have not had any significant disruptions that have not allowed us to do our work where we are deemed essential. Here is what we do control in the crisis to some extent. We can control some of our costs. Unfortunately, this means we must lay off or furlough skilled tradespeople when we have no work for them. We have had a growing workforce over the last five years. And unfortunately, in many cases, the work has abruptly stopped over the last six weeks. We have reduced our hourly workforce by 20% to 25% overall, in line with those projects that are active. About 40% of our salaried workforce is either furloughed or working with reduced hours or reduced pay of up to 25% on a temporary basis. For example, as early as March 18, we announced and temporarily reduced most of the headquarters staff pay and/or hours by 25%. This includes me and all the named executive officers. Our Board of Directors have reduced their compensation by about 22%. Our segment leadership also implemented similar cost reductions for their segment staff and leadership teams. However, about 40% of our company is still working, get pre-COVID salary and hourly levels. And in those cases, we have not significantly reduced our SG&A or cost as we need to have them have the resources they need to continue to perform for our customers. We are taking measures to protect our employees. We have been very proactive with employee safety, implementing appropriate precautionary protocols and providing the necessary PPE and training. We started social distancing practices and other safety protocols in many of our locations in the first week of March. We banned all overseas travel by the third week of February and discouraged all domestic air travel by March 16. This will impact productivity in the near term, but safety and health come first. And in this crisis, we still must protect our contractual rights. We are required under contract to provide notice on jobs that are shut down, and we have also outlined for our customers how work practices have changed and possible productivity issues we may have. Our customers know we need to do this. I firmly believe that we are all working together well now. But in the end, everything will depend on the contractual language when this crisis abates, and we must protect our rights. We are communicating frequently and consistently with our field leadership about the many areas that we will have working, but have had to lead our response while navigating the myriad of government orders from the trade-off between reduced hours and furloughs, shutdown directives, essential versus nonessential businesses, and that's just to name a few. And we are proactive working with our suppliers to keep project supplies moving, but also to stay ahead of the game on providing the best personal protective equipment that we can. However, we need to balance what we control against what we do not control. And in this case, the things we do not control outweigh the areas we do control. Our Mechanical and Electrical Construction segments are operating at about 75% to 80% of capacity right now because in many markets, we are essential, and we are still working on our most significant projects. Our Building Services segment has been the most impacted by the macro factors described above and is operating at about 65% to 70% of capacity. Our Industrial Services segment had a good first quarter and has the potential to continue in the second quarter based on several large turnarounds that are currently scheduled to be executed in the latter part of the second quarter and the early part of the third quarter. The fall schedule is neither set nor firm at this time. EIS today is operating at about 75% to 80% of capacity. The U.K. business is less impacted by nature of our customer base, and it's operating at 80% to 85% of capacity. You put all that together, we think we are deploying at about 70% to 80% of our operating capacity as of today. However, as noted above, this is a fluid situation as circumstances change day-to-day, both for the positive and the negative. The next area, and I believe the most important area and is challenging in uncertain times is the condition of and how we have managed our balance sheet. Our balance sheet is solid, our liquidity is strong. Prior to the Q&A today, Mark will provide a liquidity update under our credit facilities. Times like these are why we adhere to the fundamentals of a strong balance sheet. We've always done that, and we always will. Through these business changes and cycles, it is fundamental to who we are and how we run the business. As far as capital allocation, we see no risk to the dividend currently. We do not plan any share buybacks until any more share buybacks until we return to more normal operating conditions. We did have a strong acquisition pipeline and still do, but that will wait until some normalcy returns. We have several large acquisitions, not large I'm sorry, we have several acquisitions, much like we did last year between the $40 million and $60 million purchase price range, that would either help us increase our geographic market presence. And they are attractive and they are great companies, and they will increase our end market exposure to attractive end markets like health care, data centers, infrastructure that have long-term secular growth. But again, that will wait until some more normalcy returns. Finally, we are developing a plan to bring our company back to 100% capacity. Really, that's something we know how to do. We mobilize large job sites, significant service opportunities and large, multifaceted, multi-trade customers' contracts all the time. We know how to ramp up with speed and discipline. We have terrific prospects, have strong RPOs. And even in this disrupted market, we have market sectors that are robust, such as water and wastewater, health care and within commercial, data centers. We are still bidding and booking work through this changing and evolving environment. What we know is we are well positioned as a company in very attractive long-term markets, and we know we have some of the best operators in the industry in our subsidiary companies and at our segment level. We know we have a company whose people are resilient and tough. We know that we attract great talent and the talent acquisition may accelerate in these challenging times. We know we have one of the best long-term reputations in our industry for our employees as we have a long-term record of taking care of our employees' safety and we develop them over a long-term career with us. What we do not know is what will be the pace and timing for this recovery. However, we do know that we will not be caught flat-footed in that recovery. Taking everything into consideration and the uncertainty created by this COVID-19 pandemic, we withdrew our 2020 guidance on April 21. We hope that when we come back to you with our Q2 earnings announcement, we'll have some guidepost for 2020. We should know more by then. Before we take questions, though, I'm going to ask our CFO, Mark, to cover our line of credit and our liquidity. Mark?\nMark Pompa: Tony, thanks, again. For everybody on the call, we are now on Slide 13. Subsequent to our fourth quarter 2019 earnings call, we amended and extended our prior credit facility, which had been entered into in August of 2016. With this refinancing transaction, we refreshed the term loan component of the credit facility, increasing the amount of our term loan to $300 million from the approximately $254 million that was outstanding as of the end of December as of the end of December 2019. Additionally, we upsized the revolving credit line from the previous $900 million of capacity to $1.3 billion of available revolving credit. Under the existing terms and conditions, if necessary, this revolving credit line could be further increased by $600 million to $1.9 billion of capacity at EMCOR's discretion. This would be subject to incremental commitments from either existing or additional lenders. As a result of this transaction, which has a maturity date of March 2, 2025, EMCOR's historically strong liquidity is even more robust. At the bottom of Slide 13, you can see the amount of our outstanding borrowings at the end of the first quarter, which includes the $300 million under our term loan, which I just mentioned, which has an annual amortization requirement of 2.5% beginning in March 2021, and a 5% per annum amortization requirement in each of the succeeding three years. Additionally, we have utilized approximately $279 million of available capacity under our revolving credit line, with $200 million in direct borrowings and approximately $79 million of letters of credit issued. This activity leaves EMCOR with approximately $1.021 billion of available credit at March 31. Such liquidity is additive to our cash on hand and the operating cash flow the company expects to generate in calendar 2020, resulting from the monetization of our accounts receivable and contracted assets during the ordinary course of business. Despite any concern we have regarding the impact of COVID-19 of the COVID-19 pandemic on the markets and customers we serve, we expect to continue our long trend of generating positive operating cash flow in 2020. On a trailing 12-month basis, our debt-to-EBITDA is less than one times through March 31, and albeit higher than at any point in time during the last three years, remains low. To reiterate, EMCOR's liquidity remains strong, and we continue to be well positioned to capitalize on all opportunities. With that, once again, I will turn the call back to Tony. Tony?\nAnthony Guzzi: Yes. Thanks, Mark. And Lara, with that, we'll take questions.\nOperator: So your first question will come from the line of Mr. Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson. Sir, please proceed. Your line is now live.\nAnthony Guzzi: All right. Good morning\nBrent Thielman: Good morning, I'm doing well. Thank you. Tony, we heard from a couple of others in the contracting world about seeing more of a preference to only allow more of the established contractors that might be taking kind of safety precautions a little more seriously to come and bid. Are you seeing that at all in any of your markets?\nAnthony Guzzi: I think the kind of customers that are attracted to us and the kind of general contractors and construction managers, one of the reasons they're picking us, amongst many reasons, is not just the precautions we would take with respect to COVID safety practices and health and welfare practices, it's how we run jobs to begin with. We have industry-leading safety. In fact, we just finished one of our best quarters ever in the first quarter. We would be in the top 1% or 2% of the industry on any safety metric. So I think that could be the case. But I think the kind of people that choose us anyway, one of the reasons they're choosing us is, one, because of our safety record and the care we have for our employees; because of our strong financial position, we tend to attract not only the best supervision and leadership in the field, we tend to attract some of the best tradespeople that there are.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. I appreciate that. And then on Building Services, I'm curious, do all these delays and kind of challenges getting into the building, does that create some pent-up demand to the extent that when you can get back into these facilities, we might anticipate seeing some spikes in work?\nAnthony Guzzi: It should. But I've never managed a company through a pandemic and what that startup will look like. So I'd venture to say, I wouldn't speculate. But in normal times, you usually don't get rewarded, you usually don't get rewarded for not doing or completing your pre-summer maintenance before it becomes 90 degrees with 95% humidity in parts of the country.\nBrent Thielman: Right. Okay. And I guess my last question is on Mechanical, the big jump in RPOs, I mean even from last quarter. And I think you had BKI in that last quarter. Is there a large job or something that's an outlier? Or is it just truly reflective of some...\nAnthony Guzzi: BKI booked work just like we thought they would. We knew we bought a market leader. We knew they had terrific positions in some key Southwest markets, not only with respect to data centers, but also with respect to health care and larger institutional work with some higher education facilities. So they were part of the story, but the story is much bigger than those. We also booked some pharma work, which really only one job had anything to do with COVID. And that is one of the treatments, and I'll just leave it at that, that maybe someone might be gearing up for. But other than that, it was we had a strong booking quarter because we're in sectors that we think have long-term secular growth.\nBrent Thielman: Okay, thank you. I'll get back in queue.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question will come from the line of Noelle Dilts from Stifel. Please go ahead, your line is now live.\nNoelle Dilts: I think so much, so I just kind of wanted to ask you guys how you're thinking, if you could expand upon how you're thinking about the non-resi market longer term. In some of the conversations we've had with construction economists, they've kind of suggested that there was less overbuild in the cycle, and so they think in 2021, as things normalize, it might be pretty the spending might be pretty close to 2019 levels. I'm just curious kind of, one, how you're thinking about that? And second, how you're thinking about the opportunity around more of the renovation work, if there may be some work around airflow management and even spacing given social distancing, sort of how you're thinking about those opportunities?\nAnthony Guzzi: Yes. I mean, look, I think that trying to draw any conclusions off of what's happening today for the non-res market would be tough. Look, I think there's some underlying fundamentals that are pretty strong on the non-res side. I think the data infrastructure, I'm not even sure we're halfway where we're going to be in the next five years. I do think some repurposing of buildings will happen, some renovations will happen. I think people will continue to upgrade their HVAC systems. And you not only get better airflow, especially with some of the new control technology, but you also get a substantial energy savings. Now one of the things that are going to happen here with the operations of building, I think, over this next five months, and I don't think COVID is going to be forever. I mean, I don't think anybody does. So if we sort of fast forward a year, I think we're in a much better place. I think one of the things that are going to happen is the demand for energy is going to go up because you're going to be bringing more outside air. And as you bring in more outside air, it's untreated, but it's certainly good to dilute the space. But then you have to treat it and then you have to control for humidity more, which then controls creates more demand on the HVAC system. I think there's also things we can do to help with employees' mindset. Even before this, we were putting in UV lights and things like that on the coils and some of the fan sections, you can go to an improved filter. And so there's things you can do that could I mean, I'm certainly not saying that's for sure, but it would be common sense that it would help with air quality. And those are all things we can do in the retrofit of buildings. Now, space gets reconfigured. A lot of people went to open office plans. What will happen in the near-term with those. They could be back to open office plans in a year. They may temporarily change those open office plans. And they'll certainly help out companies like ours to help them think about what airflow looks like and temperature management looks like in those short-term change to office plans. Now what I think is going to happen here, I do think our technicians are already starting to trickle back into buildings. We've had net hiring's up. What I mean by that is, we went down big in Building Services. We're starting to hire back some of those technicians now as buildings start to say, hey, we're going to reopen, we need to be prepared and some of this work is better off to let you come in and do now versus when the building reoccupies. I do think I don't really sense that there was a lot of overbuilding. I mean and if you think about EMCOR, yes, we do residential high rise, but it's a very small part of what we do in the overall aggregate of EMCOR. It's probably less than 1.5% to 2% of what we do. And that fluctuates. We really had one big hospitality project in the last three years, and it was a very successful one, both for the owner and us. But you look at where we are, we're still a project a company that does a lot of small projects, but we also can do some of the most complicated infrastructure work. That's both transportation infrastructure work, which is mainly a electrical job for us. But then also we on data infrastructure, I mean, we're terrific builders of these hyperscale data centers in some of the most important markets. And we really made some smart acquisitions over the last two or three years to build out that capability. So even if the non-res I've always said, if the non-res market stays flat to just down a little bit, it's really not the end of the world. There's going to be a correction here because of what's going on with COVID. I don't expect that correction to be long lived. And if it goes back to where it was in 2019 and stays there for a while, I think my three colleagues on that day would say, hey, that's good. We certainly have plenty of room to operate. And I do think, echoing the comment earlier, look, I think people go to quality in an environment like this, especially for the most complicated jobs, but also the smaller jobs that require real technical capability to make sure you're achieving what you wanted to out of that renovation.\nNoelle Dilts: Great, thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question will come from the line of Adam Thalhimer from Thompson Davis. Sir, your line is now live, please proceed.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey, good morning guys. Good morning, Do you feel like you know enough today to put some guideposts around Q2 EPS?\nAnthony Guzzi: No.\nAdam Thalhimer: That's what Comfort said. I mean could that loosely hold up for you guys?\nAnthony Guzzi: I think we gave you the building blocks, Adam. We said we're working 78% to 80% of capacity. That starts to frame the revenue side. How long that will last? We could be back up to 90% of capacity by the first of June. They're starting to put plans together in some of these major markets with the unions who, I think, in these major metropolitan areas, with the Governors, will determine whether the people come back to work. Because ultimately, it's about when the men and women on the trades feel comfortable about coming back to work. So does that happen May 15, does that happen June 1? We could go from 70% to 80%, we can go to 90% by the middle of May to early June. That could be June 15. We don't know that. We don't control that. So for me to sit here and tell you, I know that would presume that I know things that only the trade unions know and really the Governor's office knows. And that's all based on epidemiology and their models, and I can't even speculate about that. I know I also know that I expect that we'll make money in the second quarter, Mark, right?\nMark Pompa: Yes.\nAnthony Guzzi: And maybe I'll let Mark talk about that a little more. And I expect that second quarter is going to be tough for everybody. Third quarter, we should start to come back, whether this is a U or a V in our industry, I don't know. I would think there's a potential we'd be somewhere in between because we have jobs that will come back. And I think third quarter, we'll get stronger based on what we know today. And fourth quarter could even be stronger. But then there could be an outbreak again in the fourth quarter, of which I have no knowledge or experience with. I do expect things to normalize by like everybody else, by first quarter of next year. Certainly, second quarter next year should be a good comp versus second quarter this year, I would think so. But and then you got to say, okay, what's going on with productivity? For people to think that there's not going to be a productivity impact as we become accustomed to these new work rules, and wearing masks and wearing shields and sanitizing tools, all of the things we absolutely need to do to keep our workforce safe, you'd be kidding yourself. Now we will learn but we're also doing things to mitigate those. People have been fairly responsible about split shifts, disaggregating the work site, the scheduling has been better than ever in a lot of our places with our construction manager customers as they try to get density down on the jobs. But those are all things that the good news about being a contractor and having the kind of people that we have working for us is we're used to dealing with change and ambiguity. And our folks approach this just like any other problem. Mark?\nMark Pompa: Yes. The only thing I mean I'll state the obvious, Adam. I mean, this company has never provided quarterly earnings guidance, and we're obviously not going to start that in 2020. But to echo Tony's comments, as we continue to refine our internal forecasting, we don't see any interim periods that will not be profitable. I will put a caveat on that though, that to the extent that market conditions don't improve, there's clearly going to be some pressure on impairment analysis relative to those parts of our business that have high levels of goodwill and intangible assets. So putting that to the side, if you look at the underlying core operations of all of our subsidiaries, despite the headwinds that we're all collectively facing and at the reduced capacities, we're still anticipating being a profitable business for all of our interim reporting periods for 2020.\nAnthony Guzzi: Here's what has been positive. And I think it, again, go to the position of our companies and markets, we're bidding and winning work right now. But I think one of the things everybody is going to have to think about, we're going to pop out the second quarter and say, backlog is likely to be up, right? Our RPOs are likely to be up because we don't usually get cancellations, and we sort of have a pretty good idea what's in there, obviously, of size, and we think there are projects that will go. But part of it is going to be up, and we're going to do our darn best to figure out what part of it. We didn't get revenue like we should have in the second quarter or aren't revenue like we should in the normal times. So there's going to be a little bit of a false positive there. I think the other thing you've got to sort of think about is decision making has slowed. And so for those larger projects, maybe outside of some of the faster pace work like data centers and those kind of works, I think there's going to be a lot more planning that's going to go on. And it's going to say, okay, we would have let that project maybe in June or July to start up in October, November, December, that planning might all push out, and you could be in a position where there's a little bit of gap in revenue, not overall revenue, but revenue that might have been maybe three to six months out from here.\nAdam Thalhimer: Yes. That was one of my key questions. So in certain sectors like retail, education, office buildings, where the assumption is that there's significant disruption, is the bidding really slow there? Or is it kind of still just not that bad?\nAnthony Guzzi: Well, again, we don't play other than on the maintenance side. And even that is not a huge part of our business on the retail side. I mean we're just not competitive in that market, except for replacement work. For the well-capitalized retailers, which for the most part is where we are, those retailers have replacement work that they had scheduled. Some of them pushed it out a month, but they're already talking to about us what that schedule will look like. Instead of April, May, what it looks like in June and then what it looks like in September or October. And that would what would be our repair contingency plans around some of that work that was supposed to be replacement. And these are people that have prospered through this pandemic. As far as education, we mainly play in the retrofit side there. And it's geared towards although we don't make a lot of guarantees, almost none. It's geared towards energy savings-type work and equipment change out and control system upgrades. We're starting to see people talk to us about starting that work early because they don't plan on bringing students back to school. As far as the commercial work, we still see decent opportunity in the retrofit side. As of today, we don't have significant commercial exposure on high-rise office building construction. There wasn't that much of it going on. We do have some on residential high-rise. But I said before, that's less than 1.5% or 2% of what we do, and that would be embedded within commercial.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. And then, last one for me. When you talk about productivity impact, I mean, how do we how should we think about having to set a model? Like if you're in electrical, you're operating within a range of, call it, 6% to 8% usually. Mechanical is 5% to 7% usually. Can you still eke out? I mean can you stay in that range even with the revenue declines you're seeing?\nAnthony Guzzi: Yes. I think as of today, yes, the answer would be because we've been at the higher end of that range. If we were in the lower end of the range, I'd be a lot less confident.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. Let's just great color. Thank you guys very much\nOperator: Thank you. And presenters, your next question will come from the line of Joe Mondillo from Sidoti & Company. Sir, please proceed. Your line is now live\nJoe Mondillo: Hi guys, good morning. Doing well. Just a question on competition. What are you seeing there? Do you think any competition is at risk in this downturn? And you may benefit from it on the other side. Just wondering what you're seeing with competition?\nAnthony Guzzi: Yes. Joe, look, there was competition. We always have competitors, and we have some really good competitors. I think there does tend to be more of a flight to quality in a downturn for significant projects. I think competition was at risk before they started, some of them, because they overextend their balance sheet as they grow. And a smaller contractor going from being $30 million to $60 million, many times does not work out well for them. I think there will be a, like there always is in a change, and this is an abrupt change, I think some people may say, you know what, this is a good time to pack it in. I can take my working capital off the table. And maybe I can go join one of these competitors I had in the local market. These tend to be the $20 million or $30 million company where the principal is really good at what they do. They tend to run that one or two large jobs themselves. And in the past, we've had some of those folks come to work for us. And I expect that to happen again. They'll come work for us for five or eight years and run big work for us, and they're great people. I never spend a lot of time worrying about what our competitors do. Again, I always go to the things I control and more appropriately, what our subsidiary or leadership controls. And so we bid work to first of all, we make sure that we have the people and resources to execute that work. And that's where we start. Do we have the people and resources to execute that work? Do we have the experience at EMCOR or specifically in that subsidiary, in a lot of cases, to do a really good job on that work technically? Then also we balance that, again, can we make money at it? And are we working for people that we actually want to work for on that job? And that's both on the service side and the construction side. And we put all that together, and that's how we decide what are the best opportunities. And then we think about the competition. I certainly, quite frankly, wish our competitors the best in this crisis. This is a terrible crisis and pandemic, and I hope they all come through it fine.\nJoe Mondillo: Okay, understand. Second question was related to the electrical RPOs. What do you make out of the RPOs there declining in the last several quarters? And what your thoughts are in that specific part of the business?\nAnthony Guzzi: Yes, I think that's like a flywheel at EMCOR that just does great, has great margins, has great cash conversion, has terrific prospects. I don't read too much into that. That's the ebb and flow of work. And I know we have a very active bid log, and we booked some really great work in the Electrical segment over the last five or six weeks.\nJoe Mondillo: Okay. Last question. You provided a lot of information this morning and there's a lot going on, a lot of moving pieces with the economy in general, whatnot. What are your biggest sort of challenges managing the company from the executive level in this specific time period? And what are you looking at or maybe most concerned of regarding the situation?\nAnthony Guzzi: I think you start with, you've got to do everything you can as a leader and set the climate that you expected as a leader, and this leadership team is with me here. I would say that we believe our primary responsibility right now is to make sure that we can execute the work safely and with the well-being of our employees in mind. And then we have to be able to accomplish that work to the technical specifications that our customers expect. This pandemic would not be excuse for us not delivering a quality product to our customers. I think then all the operating practices we've had at EMCOR takeover, right? We have very strong values-oriented company. We have a culture of focusing on the most important things, whether it be operationally or financially. And based on what you see with our balance sheet, I could Mark could take you through what is, and we're not going to do that right now, a very, very detailed cash planning that goes on and cash forecasting, whether the markets are good, bad, mediocre. It's just part of our DNA. And that DNA serves us well when thing times are good, and it serves us well when times are a little tougher. And one thing I don't lie awake worrying about is I'm really sure that EMCOR will come through this fine. EMCOR will come through this stronger than our competitors. And that our people will do the right thing in the field to protect the well-being of our employees. And one of the things we have to do as a leadership team, all the way down through the subsidiary leadership, is we've got to communicate, communicate, communicate. We have to be consistent in that communication. And we have to provide people good information. The work that our legal team, our human resources teams and our safety teams and our financial teams have done through this crisis to get our operating teams the right information they need to be able to implement these myriad of things that have come out on these different relief packages, what it means for our employees, what it means for us and how we make sure that we not only comply with federal law, that we do right by our employees and our shareholders while we're doing that and our customers, but also how do we make sure that we can distill that information to things that people can understand, that goes to what is really an essential business versus a nonessential business. It goes to how do we work with our supply chain? We were out in front of this in relatively short order, thinking about PPE needs for our employees. And that goes all the way from the top down. That goes from me, all the way down through the organization worried about that. We anticipate that we're going to be wearing masks in different environments for a long time, and we acted appropriately. We have all kind of protocols around tool sanitation and job site safety. And we have a structure that allows us to communicate effectively. We have contingency plans that we develop for crises, although we didn't quite think it would be this crisis when we developed them. But our guys know how to ramp up and ramp down and focus on what's important. I think it's just the nature of who we are. We're conservative, right Mark? We took a we've been at one meeting more than one meeting when we've had a lot of people tell us the beauty of leverage. And I guess we never quite believed that, did we?\nMark Pompa: Of course, we did not.\nAnthony Guzzi: Right. And I think that shows right now. And we'll run the business like we always do, and we'll get to the other side of this.\nJoe Mondillo: Okay, thanks. Well, I hope you're all safe and well and good luck with everything\nAnthony Guzzi: Same to you. Joe, thank you.\nOperator: And there are no further questions in the queue. Presenters, you may please continue.\nAnthony Guzzi: Look, we're clearly in unprecedented times. And for anybody that's listening, I know there's a lot of EMCOR employees listening, we'll all get through this, we'll come out strong. Unfortunately, everybody is making a lot of tough decisions right now. We hope to see everybody back to work, and we'll do that the right way too; we'll have everybody's safety in mind when we do that. But let's always remember, we also got to accomplish the mission we have for our customers, and our shareholders; and we will do that, too. And we couldn't be more proud of how everybody has responded. And we'll come out of the other side of this stronger. With that, thank you all very much, and everybody, be safe.\nOperator: Again, thank you everyone for participating. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Stay safe, and have a lovely day.",

            "name": "Anthony Guzzi",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Kevin. And I'm going to be on Pages four through six. As we have already released preliminary results, I am not going to speak that much to the first quarter of 2020. Mark will. I will cover some of the highlights, and Mark will speak to the detailed results. And then I will end with an overview of what we are seeing in the marketplace today. Even when faced with significant obstacles, we had a record quarter. We set first quarter records for revenues, gross profit, gross margin, operating income and diluted earnings per share from continuing operation. The entire EMCOR organization has responded well to this COVID-19 crisis. I thank our leadership and all of our employees for focusing first on our employees' health and safety, and I also thank them for keeping focus on our business during these challenging times. We have a company values of mission first, people always. We train those values, we hire on those values, and we promote our team on those values. It serves us well in these challenging times. I will quickly summarize some highlights for the quarter. Our Mechanical and Electrical Construction segments had a very strong quarter, led by our work in data centers, health care and food processing. We had a particularly strong booking quarter in these segments. Our Building Services segment had the most disruption in the first quarter from COVID-19 as our owner customers started to limit access for our HVAC technicians and our commercial site-based businesses. However, we executed very well until mid-March, and our project execution was very strong, and we booked some very nice retrofit and energy savings projects. Our Industrial Services segment had a very good quarter despite a challenging end market. We had strengthened our field operations and executed several large turnarounds. Some of our work was pushed from mid-March until later in the second quarter or the results would have even been better. Our U.K. segment had a terrific quarter. We leave the quarter with a strong and liquid balance sheet, record Remaining Performance Obligations or RPOs and a business that still has opportunities to operate in this unprecedented environment. We are well positioned to continue serving our markets and our customers in an expanded way when normalized operations resume. With that, I will turn it over to Mark to discuss the quarter in more detail. Thanks, Mark, and I'm on Page 11, which I will cover Remaining Performance Obligations by segment and market sector. As stated earlier, we had a strong bookings quarter. Total RPOs at the end of the first quarter were $4.42 billion, up $267 million or 6.4% when compared to the March 2019 level of $4.16 billion. In fact, this RPO total is the highest quarterly total reported since we initiated RPO reporting in March 2018 and higher than any backlog level we reported prior to that. Domestic RPOs have increased $284 million or 7.1% since the year ago period, driven mainly by our Mechanical Construction segment. We did close a few strategic mechanical construction acquisitions in 2019, which helped support that growth. Book-to-bill measuring first quarter 2020 RPO activity over year-end 2019 activity was close to 1.2, which is fairly strong performance considering the strong first quarter revenues of $2.3 billion. So from the end of 2019, total RPOs increased $388 million or 9.6%. On the right side of the page, we show RPOs by market sector. $1.8 billion of this is classified as projects in the commercial sector. We view this sector broadly and beyond office and financial facilities. This sector also includes high-tech and data center projects that we continue to bid and construct. We are building these highly complex, fast-paced data center projects for the largest Internet and data storage providers. And while there are certain dense geographies for data center construction, like the Mid-Atlantic and the Pacific Northwest, where we have industry-leading expertise in our Dyna Washington, Poole and Kent North and Dyna Oregon companies, we are also seeing other areas of the country where data center construction is building up for the large providers. EMCOR companies are uniquely suited to do this work in other parts of the country as well. Two such areas are in Dallas and Iowa, where in the last 18 months or so, we have made electrical construction and service acquisitions investments to address growth in these geographic areas. Also, last November, we announced the acquisition of Batchelor & Kimball, or BKI. This terrific Atlanta-based full-service mechanical contractor is a nationwide leader in constructing large, complex construction projects, including data centers, with a strong performance record for data centers in the broader Southeast and Oklahoma. Additionally, BKI also is a leading provider of health care facilities, another market sector that saw RPO growth in the year-over-year and first three months of 2020. Before I leave here, because I know you're going to ask, I want to address a certain question. Yes, we have performed several projects across the country either to support the Corp of Engineers, municipalities or our health care provider customers. And what we're doing is expanding or retrofitting facilities to allow for the better treatment of COVID-19 patients. This work was, for the most part, being executed on a time and material basis. Therefore, it's, for the most part, not included in RPOs. In the aggregate, while this work is incredibly important to support our customers, this work has not substantially impacted our results. In summary, all I can say is that the current bidding environment is still active in most areas in the countries, and I'll speak to that in a moment. And while it is very rare the projects that we are working on get canceled, there is going to be a certain degree of uncertainty with respect to the rollout of this work in this fluid environment that we are operating in at this time. And now I'm going to go to Pages 12 and 13, and I'm going to talk about what the external environment looks like and what the internal environment that we're dealing with looks like. As I think about our business, I again rely on what has always been our operating philosophy at EMCOR. You only can control what you can control, and you have to react to the macro disruptions and problems in a disciplined and process-oriented manner. We will keep our focus on our core values of mission first, people always. We know that we create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders by focusing on our task at hand and maintaining the discipline that has served us so well in good and bad markets. And in markets like the one in which we are currently operating that have changed very abruptly, we must keep executing our mission for our customers, but we must also keep our employees safe, which is one of our core values. Fortunately, it is in our DNA to have robust contingency plans that focus not only on opportunity capture in any market, but also resiliency to react to markets and job site conditions that change for better or worse. And as contracts, markets, job sites and the overall environment changes, we are used to adjusting to changes in those conditions and know how to pivot responsibly and appropriately on very short notice. So first, let's discuss the operating environment, the external operating environment that we are operating in. In many cases, we are still operating full force as we are deemed an essential business in many states and cities. However, this changes to the plus or minus every day. Boston, New York City, New Jersey, parts of the San Francisco Bay Area and Pennsylvania, all are under work stoppage or EMCOR's project and service work are not deemed essential. However, even in those places, we are still operating at 25% to 30% of capacity as that work is deemed essential. Our small project work and technician-based businesses have been the most impacted of our United States businesses. Customers have shut much of this down, but I do not expect this shutdown will continue as a lot of this work is needed service for summer start up and required maintenance, replacement and repair work. And always keep in mind that we do not determine whether a project is stop or a service site is closed. Our owner, general contractor, construction manager and EPC contractor customers determine that, and we respond accordingly. The oil war and now the oil glut, emanating from significantly reduced demand, is ongoing and having an impact on our oil and gas customers. This affects both our more limited upstream business where the impact has been most significant to our much larger downstream business, where there has been less of an impact to date. When you talk about how we get supplies, right, to do our job, supply disruption may also happen as manufacturers and/or distributors are forced to close plants in certain states and/or countries as those plant personnel are quarantined or facilities are closed for cleaning or the government decides that facility is not essential. To date, we have not had any significant disruptions that have not allowed us to do our work where we are deemed essential. Here is what we do control in the crisis to some extent. We can control some of our costs. Unfortunately, this means we must lay off or furlough skilled tradespeople when we have no work for them. We have had a growing workforce over the last five years. And unfortunately, in many cases, the work has abruptly stopped over the last six weeks. We have reduced our hourly workforce by 20% to 25% overall, in line with those projects that are active. About 40% of our salaried workforce is either furloughed or working with reduced hours or reduced pay of up to 25% on a temporary basis. For example, as early as March 18, we announced and temporarily reduced most of the headquarters staff pay and/or hours by 25%. This includes me and all the named executive officers. Our Board of Directors have reduced their compensation by about 22%. Our segment leadership also implemented similar cost reductions for their segment staff and leadership teams. However, about 40% of our company is still working, get pre-COVID salary and hourly levels. And in those cases, we have not significantly reduced our SG&A or cost as we need to have them have the resources they need to continue to perform for our customers. We are taking measures to protect our employees. We have been very proactive with employee safety, implementing appropriate precautionary protocols and providing the necessary PPE and training. We started social distancing practices and other safety protocols in many of our locations in the first week of March. We banned all overseas travel by the third week of February and discouraged all domestic air travel by March 16. This will impact productivity in the near term, but safety and health come first. And in this crisis, we still must protect our contractual rights. We are required under contract to provide notice on jobs that are shut down, and we have also outlined for our customers how work practices have changed and possible productivity issues we may have. Our customers know we need to do this. I firmly believe that we are all working together well now. But in the end, everything will depend on the contractual language when this crisis abates, and we must protect our rights. We are communicating frequently and consistently with our field leadership about the many areas that we will have working, but have had to lead our response while navigating the myriad of government orders from the trade-off between reduced hours and furloughs, shutdown directives, essential versus nonessential businesses, and that's just to name a few. And we are proactive working with our suppliers to keep project supplies moving, but also to stay ahead of the game on providing the best personal protective equipment that we can. However, we need to balance what we control against what we do not control. And in this case, the things we do not control outweigh the areas we do control. Our Mechanical and Electrical Construction segments are operating at about 75% to 80% of capacity right now because in many markets, we are essential, and we are still working on our most significant projects. Our Building Services segment has been the most impacted by the macro factors described above and is operating at about 65% to 70% of capacity. Our Industrial Services segment had a good first quarter and has the potential to continue in the second quarter based on several large turnarounds that are currently scheduled to be executed in the latter part of the second quarter and the early part of the third quarter. The fall schedule is neither set nor firm at this time. EIS today is operating at about 75% to 80% of capacity. The U.K. business is less impacted by nature of our customer base, and it's operating at 80% to 85% of capacity. You put all that together, we think we are deploying at about 70% to 80% of our operating capacity as of today. However, as noted above, this is a fluid situation as circumstances change day-to-day, both for the positive and the negative. The next area, and I believe the most important area and is challenging in uncertain times is the condition of and how we have managed our balance sheet. Our balance sheet is solid, our liquidity is strong. Prior to the Q&A today, Mark will provide a liquidity update under our credit facilities. Times like these are why we adhere to the fundamentals of a strong balance sheet. We've always done that, and we always will. Through these business changes and cycles, it is fundamental to who we are and how we run the business. As far as capital allocation, we see no risk to the dividend currently. We do not plan any share buybacks until any more share buybacks until we return to more normal operating conditions. We did have a strong acquisition pipeline and still do, but that will wait until some normalcy returns. We have several large acquisitions, not large I'm sorry, we have several acquisitions, much like we did last year between the $40 million and $60 million purchase price range, that would either help us increase our geographic market presence. And they are attractive and they are great companies, and they will increase our end market exposure to attractive end markets like health care, data centers, infrastructure that have long-term secular growth. But again, that will wait until some more normalcy returns. Finally, we are developing a plan to bring our company back to 100% capacity. Really, that's something we know how to do. We mobilize large job sites, significant service opportunities and large, multifaceted, multi-trade customers' contracts all the time. We know how to ramp up with speed and discipline. We have terrific prospects, have strong RPOs. And even in this disrupted market, we have market sectors that are robust, such as water and wastewater, health care and within commercial, data centers. We are still bidding and booking work through this changing and evolving environment. What we know is we are well positioned as a company in very attractive long-term markets, and we know we have some of the best operators in the industry in our subsidiary companies and at our segment level. We know we have a company whose people are resilient and tough. We know that we attract great talent and the talent acquisition may accelerate in these challenging times. We know we have one of the best long-term reputations in our industry for our employees as we have a long-term record of taking care of our employees' safety and we develop them over a long-term career with us. What we do not know is what will be the pace and timing for this recovery. However, we do know that we will not be caught flat-footed in that recovery. Taking everything into consideration and the uncertainty created by this COVID-19 pandemic, we withdrew our 2020 guidance on April 21. We hope that when we come back to you with our Q2 earnings announcement, we'll have some guidepost for 2020. We should know more by then. Before we take questions, though, I'm going to ask our CFO, Mark, to cover our line of credit and our liquidity. Mark? Yes. Thanks, Mark. And Lara, with that, we'll take questions. All right. Good morning I think the kind of customers that are attracted to us and the kind of general contractors and construction managers, one of the reasons they're picking us, amongst many reasons, is not just the precautions we would take with respect to COVID safety practices and health and welfare practices, it's how we run jobs to begin with. We have industry-leading safety. In fact, we just finished one of our best quarters ever in the first quarter. We would be in the top 1% or 2% of the industry on any safety metric. So I think that could be the case. But I think the kind of people that choose us anyway, one of the reasons they're choosing us is, one, because of our safety record and the care we have for our employees; because of our strong financial position, we tend to attract not only the best supervision and leadership in the field, we tend to attract some of the best tradespeople that there are. It should. But I've never managed a company through a pandemic and what that startup will look like. So I'd venture to say, I wouldn't speculate. But in normal times, you usually don't get rewarded, you usually don't get rewarded for not doing or completing your pre-summer maintenance before it becomes 90 degrees with 95% humidity in parts of the country. BKI booked work just like we thought they would. We knew we bought a market leader. We knew they had terrific positions in some key Southwest markets, not only with respect to data centers, but also with respect to health care and larger institutional work with some higher education facilities. So they were part of the story, but the story is much bigger than those. We also booked some pharma work, which really only one job had anything to do with COVID. And that is one of the treatments, and I'll just leave it at that, that maybe someone might be gearing up for. But other than that, it was we had a strong booking quarter because we're in sectors that we think have long-term secular growth. Yes. I mean, look, I think that trying to draw any conclusions off of what's happening today for the non-res market would be tough. Look, I think there's some underlying fundamentals that are pretty strong on the non-res side. I think the data infrastructure, I'm not even sure we're halfway where we're going to be in the next five years. I do think some repurposing of buildings will happen, some renovations will happen. I think people will continue to upgrade their HVAC systems. And you not only get better airflow, especially with some of the new control technology, but you also get a substantial energy savings. Now one of the things that are going to happen here with the operations of building, I think, over this next five months, and I don't think COVID is going to be forever. I mean, I don't think anybody does. So if we sort of fast forward a year, I think we're in a much better place. I think one of the things that are going to happen is the demand for energy is going to go up because you're going to be bringing more outside air. And as you bring in more outside air, it's untreated, but it's certainly good to dilute the space. But then you have to treat it and then you have to control for humidity more, which then controls creates more demand on the HVAC system. I think there's also things we can do to help with employees' mindset. Even before this, we were putting in UV lights and things like that on the coils and some of the fan sections, you can go to an improved filter. And so there's things you can do that could I mean, I'm certainly not saying that's for sure, but it would be common sense that it would help with air quality. And those are all things we can do in the retrofit of buildings. Now, space gets reconfigured. A lot of people went to open office plans. What will happen in the near-term with those. They could be back to open office plans in a year. They may temporarily change those open office plans. And they'll certainly help out companies like ours to help them think about what airflow looks like and temperature management looks like in those short-term change to office plans. Now what I think is going to happen here, I do think our technicians are already starting to trickle back into buildings. We've had net hiring's up. What I mean by that is, we went down big in Building Services. We're starting to hire back some of those technicians now as buildings start to say, hey, we're going to reopen, we need to be prepared and some of this work is better off to let you come in and do now versus when the building reoccupies. I do think I don't really sense that there was a lot of overbuilding. I mean and if you think about EMCOR, yes, we do residential high rise, but it's a very small part of what we do in the overall aggregate of EMCOR. It's probably less than 1.5% to 2% of what we do. And that fluctuates. We really had one big hospitality project in the last three years, and it was a very successful one, both for the owner and us. But you look at where we are, we're still a project a company that does a lot of small projects, but we also can do some of the most complicated infrastructure work. That's both transportation infrastructure work, which is mainly a electrical job for us. But then also we on data infrastructure, I mean, we're terrific builders of these hyperscale data centers in some of the most important markets. And we really made some smart acquisitions over the last two or three years to build out that capability. So even if the non-res I've always said, if the non-res market stays flat to just down a little bit, it's really not the end of the world. There's going to be a correction here because of what's going on with COVID. I don't expect that correction to be long lived. And if it goes back to where it was in 2019 and stays there for a while, I think my three colleagues on that day would say, hey, that's good. We certainly have plenty of room to operate. And I do think, echoing the comment earlier, look, I think people go to quality in an environment like this, especially for the most complicated jobs, but also the smaller jobs that require real technical capability to make sure you're achieving what you wanted to out of that renovation. No. I think we gave you the building blocks, Adam. We said we're working 78% to 80% of capacity. That starts to frame the revenue side. How long that will last? We could be back up to 90% of capacity by the first of June. They're starting to put plans together in some of these major markets with the unions who, I think, in these major metropolitan areas, with the Governors, will determine whether the people come back to work. Because ultimately, it's about when the men and women on the trades feel comfortable about coming back to work. So does that happen May 15, does that happen June 1? We could go from 70% to 80%, we can go to 90% by the middle of May to early June. That could be June 15. We don't know that. We don't control that. So for me to sit here and tell you, I know that would presume that I know things that only the trade unions know and really the Governor's office knows. And that's all based on epidemiology and their models, and I can't even speculate about that. I know I also know that I expect that we'll make money in the second quarter, Mark, right? And maybe I'll let Mark talk about that a little more. And I expect that second quarter is going to be tough for everybody. Third quarter, we should start to come back, whether this is a U or a V in our industry, I don't know. I would think there's a potential we'd be somewhere in between because we have jobs that will come back. And I think third quarter, we'll get stronger based on what we know today. And fourth quarter could even be stronger. But then there could be an outbreak again in the fourth quarter, of which I have no knowledge or experience with. I do expect things to normalize by like everybody else, by first quarter of next year. Certainly, second quarter next year should be a good comp versus second quarter this year, I would think so. But and then you got to say, okay, what's going on with productivity? For people to think that there's not going to be a productivity impact as we become accustomed to these new work rules, and wearing masks and wearing shields and sanitizing tools, all of the things we absolutely need to do to keep our workforce safe, you'd be kidding yourself. Now we will learn but we're also doing things to mitigate those. People have been fairly responsible about split shifts, disaggregating the work site, the scheduling has been better than ever in a lot of our places with our construction manager customers as they try to get density down on the jobs. But those are all things that the good news about being a contractor and having the kind of people that we have working for us is we're used to dealing with change and ambiguity. And our folks approach this just like any other problem. Mark? Here's what has been positive. And I think it, again, go to the position of our companies and markets, we're bidding and winning work right now. But I think one of the things everybody is going to have to think about, we're going to pop out the second quarter and say, backlog is likely to be up, right? Our RPOs are likely to be up because we don't usually get cancellations, and we sort of have a pretty good idea what's in there, obviously, of size, and we think there are projects that will go. But part of it is going to be up, and we're going to do our darn best to figure out what part of it. We didn't get revenue like we should have in the second quarter or aren't revenue like we should in the normal times. So there's going to be a little bit of a false positive there. I think the other thing you've got to sort of think about is decision making has slowed. And so for those larger projects, maybe outside of some of the faster pace work like data centers and those kind of works, I think there's going to be a lot more planning that's going to go on. And it's going to say, okay, we would have let that project maybe in June or July to start up in October, November, December, that planning might all push out, and you could be in a position where there's a little bit of gap in revenue, not overall revenue, but revenue that might have been maybe three to six months out from here. Well, again, we don't play other than on the maintenance side. And even that is not a huge part of our business on the retail side. I mean we're just not competitive in that market, except for replacement work. For the well-capitalized retailers, which for the most part is where we are, those retailers have replacement work that they had scheduled. Some of them pushed it out a month, but they're already talking to about us what that schedule will look like. Instead of April, May, what it looks like in June and then what it looks like in September or October. And that would what would be our repair contingency plans around some of that work that was supposed to be replacement. And these are people that have prospered through this pandemic. As far as education, we mainly play in the retrofit side there. And it's geared towards although we don't make a lot of guarantees, almost none. It's geared towards energy savings-type work and equipment change out and control system upgrades. We're starting to see people talk to us about starting that work early because they don't plan on bringing students back to school. As far as the commercial work, we still see decent opportunity in the retrofit side. As of today, we don't have significant commercial exposure on high-rise office building construction. There wasn't that much of it going on. We do have some on residential high-rise. But I said before, that's less than 1.5% or 2% of what we do, and that would be embedded within commercial. Yes. I think as of today, yes, the answer would be because we've been at the higher end of that range. If we were in the lower end of the range, I'd be a lot less confident. Yes. Joe, look, there was competition. We always have competitors, and we have some really good competitors. I think there does tend to be more of a flight to quality in a downturn for significant projects. I think competition was at risk before they started, some of them, because they overextend their balance sheet as they grow. And a smaller contractor going from being $30 million to $60 million, many times does not work out well for them. I think there will be a, like there always is in a change, and this is an abrupt change, I think some people may say, you know what, this is a good time to pack it in. I can take my working capital off the table. And maybe I can go join one of these competitors I had in the local market. These tend to be the $20 million or $30 million company where the principal is really good at what they do. They tend to run that one or two large jobs themselves. And in the past, we've had some of those folks come to work for us. And I expect that to happen again. They'll come work for us for five or eight years and run big work for us, and they're great people. I never spend a lot of time worrying about what our competitors do. Again, I always go to the things I control and more appropriately, what our subsidiary or leadership controls. And so we bid work to first of all, we make sure that we have the people and resources to execute that work. And that's where we start. Do we have the people and resources to execute that work? Do we have the experience at EMCOR or specifically in that subsidiary, in a lot of cases, to do a really good job on that work technically? Then also we balance that, again, can we make money at it? And are we working for people that we actually want to work for on that job? And that's both on the service side and the construction side. And we put all that together, and that's how we decide what are the best opportunities. And then we think about the competition. I certainly, quite frankly, wish our competitors the best in this crisis. This is a terrible crisis and pandemic, and I hope they all come through it fine. Yes, I think that's like a flywheel at EMCOR that just does great, has great margins, has great cash conversion, has terrific prospects. I don't read too much into that. That's the ebb and flow of work. And I know we have a very active bid log, and we booked some really great work in the Electrical segment over the last five or six weeks. I think you start with, you've got to do everything you can as a leader and set the climate that you expected as a leader, and this leadership team is with me here. I would say that we believe our primary responsibility right now is to make sure that we can execute the work safely and with the well-being of our employees in mind. And then we have to be able to accomplish that work to the technical specifications that our customers expect. This pandemic would not be excuse for us not delivering a quality product to our customers. I think then all the operating practices we've had at EMCOR takeover, right? We have very strong values-oriented company. We have a culture of focusing on the most important things, whether it be operationally or financially. And based on what you see with our balance sheet, I could Mark could take you through what is, and we're not going to do that right now, a very, very detailed cash planning that goes on and cash forecasting, whether the markets are good, bad, mediocre. It's just part of our DNA. And that DNA serves us well when thing times are good, and it serves us well when times are a little tougher. And one thing I don't lie awake worrying about is I'm really sure that EMCOR will come through this fine. EMCOR will come through this stronger than our competitors. And that our people will do the right thing in the field to protect the well-being of our employees. And one of the things we have to do as a leadership team, all the way down through the subsidiary leadership, is we've got to communicate, communicate, communicate. We have to be consistent in that communication. And we have to provide people good information. The work that our legal team, our human resources teams and our safety teams and our financial teams have done through this crisis to get our operating teams the right information they need to be able to implement these myriad of things that have come out on these different relief packages, what it means for our employees, what it means for us and how we make sure that we not only comply with federal law, that we do right by our employees and our shareholders while we're doing that and our customers, but also how do we make sure that we can distill that information to things that people can understand, that goes to what is really an essential business versus a nonessential business. It goes to how do we work with our supply chain? We were out in front of this in relatively short order, thinking about PPE needs for our employees. And that goes all the way from the top down. That goes from me, all the way down through the organization worried about that. We anticipate that we're going to be wearing masks in different environments for a long time, and we acted appropriately. We have all kind of protocols around tool sanitation and job site safety. And we have a structure that allows us to communicate effectively. We have contingency plans that we develop for crises, although we didn't quite think it would be this crisis when we developed them. But our guys know how to ramp up and ramp down and focus on what's important. I think it's just the nature of who we are. We're conservative, right Mark? We took a we've been at one meeting more than one meeting when we've had a lot of people tell us the beauty of leverage. And I guess we never quite believed that, did we? Right. And I think that shows right now. And we'll run the business like we always do, and we'll get to the other side of this. Same to you. Joe, thank you. Look, we're clearly in unprecedented times. And for anybody that's listening, I know there's a lot of EMCOR employees listening, we'll all get through this, we'll come out strong. Unfortunately, everybody is making a lot of tough decisions right now. We hope to see everybody back to work, and we'll do that the right way too; we'll have everybody's safety in mind when we do that. But let's always remember, we also got to accomplish the mission we have for our customers, and our shareholders; and we will do that, too. And we couldn't be more proud of how everybody has responded. And we'll come out of the other side of this stronger. With that, thank you all very much, and everybody, be safe."

            "content": "Thank you, Tony, and good morning to everyone on the call today. For those accessing this presentation via the webcast, we are now on Slide 7. Over the next several slides, I will augment Tony's opening commentary and review each of our reportable segments' first quarter operating performance, as well as other chief financial data derived from our consolidated financial statements included in both our earnings release announcement and Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier today. So, let's expand our review of EMCOR's first quarter performance. Consolidated revenues of $2.3 billion are up $141.1 million or 6.5% over quarter one 2019. Our first quarter results include $82.5 million of revenues attributable to businesses acquired pertaining to the period of time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in last year's first quarter. Acquisition revenues positively impacted each of our United States Electrical Construction, United States Mechanical Construction and United States Building Services segments. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired, first quarter consolidated revenues increased approximately $58.6 million or 2.7%. All of EMCOR's reportable segments other than our United States Electrical Construction segment reported revenue growth during the first quarter of 2020. United States Electrical Construction revenues of $525.2 million decreased $2.8 million or approximately 0.5% from 2019's first quarter. Excluding acquisition revenues of $25.4 million, this segment's quarterly revenues declined 5.3% organically quarter-over-quarter. Revenue declines within the commercial, transportation, water and hospitality market sectors due to the completion of certain projects during 2019, were partially offset by increased project revenues within the manufacturing, institutional and health care market sectors. United States Mechanical Construction revenues of $834.1 million increased $81.7 million or 10.9% from quarter one 2019. Excluding acquisition revenues of $55.5 million, this segment's revenues grew organically 3.5% quarter-over-quarter. Revenue growth was primarily attributable to an increase in revenues from manufacturing, health care, transportation and institutional projects. These revenue gains were partially offset by contractions in project activity within the commercial, hospitality and water market sectors. First quarter revenues for EMCOR's total domestic construction business of $1.36 billion increased $78.9 million or 6.2%. As Tony will cover later during this presentation, our combined United States construction business has experienced growth, both sequentially and year-over-year in the Remaining Performance Obligations through March 31. United States Building Services quarterly revenues of $518.1 million, increased $6 million or just over 1%, the majority of which was attributable to organic activities. Revenue gains within the segment's mechanical services division were substantially offset by quarter-over-quarter revenue declines within each of their commercial site-based energy and government services divisions. United States Industrial Services revenues of $310 million increased $51.4 million or 19.9% as a result of higher field services activities as we executed a fairly strong spring turnaround schedule when compared to the prior year. Offsetting the quarter-over-quarter revenue growth was a decline in this segment's shop services revenues due to a reduction in new build heat exchanger sales. United Kingdom Building Services revenues of $112.4 million increased $4.8 million or 4.5% due to incremental revenues from new maintenance contracts as well as continued project and repair activity across their customer portfolio. Quarterly revenue growth was hindered by $2.2 million of foreign exchange headwinds. Please turn to Slide 8. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $227 million represent 9.9% of first quarter revenues and reflect an increase of $20.8 million from quarter one 2019. SG&A for the first quarter of 2020 includes approximately $9 million of incremental expenses from businesses acquired, inclusive of intangible asset amortization, resulting in an organic quarter-over-quarter increase of approximately $11.8 million. This organic increase is primarily due to higher employment costs as a result of increased headcount to support our pre-COVID-19 revenue growth expectations as well as incremental expense for credit losses within the quarter. This incremental expense compares unfavorably to 2019's first quarter, which included a recovery of credit losses or bad debts that have been previously written off. In addition, the first quarter of 2019 benefited from a favorable legal settlement within our Industrial Services segment, which was recorded as a reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses. The current year increases were partially offset by a reduction in incentive compensation expense year-over-year. Reported operating income for the quarter of $106 million represents 4.6% of revenues and compares to $102.3 million or 4.7% of revenues in 2019's first quarter. This performance represents a $3.7 million increase or 3.6% period-over-period. Our U.S. Electrical Construction Services segment operating income of $43.9 million increased approximately $1 million from the comparable 2019 period. Reported operating margin of 8.4% represents a 30 basis point improvement over last year's first quarter. The increase in this segment's operating income is primarily due to incremental contribution from a business acquired in 2019. The improvement in operating margin, however, is due to favorable project execution, inclusive of project closeouts within the quarter. First quarter operating income of our U.S. Mechanical Construction Services segment of $45.2 million represents a $4.2 million increase from 2019. Operating margin of 5.4% is consistent year-over-year. The increase in the segment's operating income is partially attributable to the incremental contribution from businesses acquired as well as increased gross profit from organic activities within the manufacturing market sector. Our total U.S. construction business is reporting $89.1 million of operating income and a 6.6% operating margin. This performance has improved by $5.1 million or 6.1% from 2019's first quarter. Operating income for U.S. Building Services of $20.8 million represents 4% of revenues and is a $6.6 million reduction from last year's first quarter. Operating margin decreased by 140 basis points. The quarter-over-quarter reduction in operating income is due to lower gross profit from the segment's commercial site-based services division as a result of the reduction in snow removal revenues as well as a decline in gross profit within their energy services division due to a decrease in large project activity, given the substantial completion of certain projects in 2019. Additionally, the reduction in operating margin quarter-over-quarter is due to the under absorption of certain overhead costs in those divisions that experienced revenue declines as well as an increase in the provision for credit losses within this segment as compared to 2019's first quarter, which benefited from the recovery of certain receivables, which had been previously written off. Our U.S. Industrial Services segment is reporting operating income of $12.3 million or 4% of revenues. The previously referenced quarter-over-quarter growth in field services activities resulted in an improvement in both operating income and operating margin when compared to 2019's corresponding period. U.K. Building Services operating income of $5.8 million represents 5.1% of revenues, which is an improvement of $1.6 million and 120 basis points of operating margin expansion over 2019's first quarter. Our EMCOR U.K. team continues to do an excellent job of fostering new maintenance customer relationships and executing follow-on repair and project services while maintaining a disciplined cost structure. We are now on Slide 9. Additional financial items of significance for the quarter not addressed on my previous slides are as follows: quarter one gross profit of $333.1 million represents 14.5% of revenues, which has improved from the comparable 2019 quarter by $24.3 million and 20 basis points of gross margin. The increase in consolidated gross profit is a result of increases across all our reportable segments, other than U.S. Building Services, while the gross margin improvement is due to continued excellence in project execution, primarily within our United States construction segments. Diluted earnings per common share was $1.35 as compared to $1.28 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2019. This represents a 5.5% improvement quarter-over-quarter. We are now on Slide 10. I will address EMCOR's liquidity profile directly a little later in this morning's call. But as you can see on this slide, our balance sheet continues to maintain its strength. Cash on hand is slightly down from year-end 2019 as a result of cash used in operations, primarily due to the funding of 2019's company-wide incentive compensation awards. Additionally, with respect to cash used in financing activities, we repurchased approximately $99 million of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program. These uses of cash were offset by incremental borrowings of $192.5 million under our amended and extended credit facility during the quarter. Working capital levels have increased due to our organic revenue growth as well as an increase in accounts receivable and a corresponding decrease in net contract liabilities related to certain delays in customer billings resulting from the RYUK ransomware attack we disclosed in connection with our 2019 year-end earnings call and Form 10-K filing. We are currently caught up with our transaction processing, however, that does not necessarily translate to quicker turnaround when it comes to payment from our customers. The increase in goodwill is due to the business acquired during the first quarter within our U.S. Building Services segment. Net identifiable intangible assets decreased as a result of $14.7 million of intangible asset amortization, partially offset by the impact of additional intangible assets recognized in connection with the previously referenced 2020 acquisition. Total debt, excluding operating lease liabilities, is approximately $505 million and represents an increase of $192.3 million from year-end 2019. As a result of our outstanding borrowings, we had a debt to capitalization ratio of 19.9% as compared to 13.2% at December 31, 2019. As I mentioned earlier, I will cover EMCOR's liquidity in greater depth later in this morning's presentation after I turn the call back to Tony. Tony? Tony, thanks, again. For everybody on the call, we are now on Slide 13. Subsequent to our fourth quarter 2019 earnings call, we amended and extended our prior credit facility, which had been entered into in August of 2016. With this refinancing transaction, we refreshed the term loan component of the credit facility, increasing the amount of our term loan to $300 million from the approximately $254 million that was outstanding as of the end of December as of the end of December 2019. Additionally, we upsized the revolving credit line from the previous $900 million of capacity to $1.3 billion of available revolving credit. Under the existing terms and conditions, if necessary, this revolving credit line could be further increased by $600 million to $1.9 billion of capacity at EMCOR's discretion. This would be subject to incremental commitments from either existing or additional lenders. As a result of this transaction, which has a maturity date of March 2, 2025, EMCOR's historically strong liquidity is even more robust. At the bottom of Slide 13, you can see the amount of our outstanding borrowings at the end of the first quarter, which includes the $300 million under our term loan, which I just mentioned, which has an annual amortization requirement of 2.5% beginning in March 2021, and a 5% per annum amortization requirement in each of the succeeding three years. Additionally, we have utilized approximately $279 million of available capacity under our revolving credit line, with $200 million in direct borrowings and approximately $79 million of letters of credit issued. This activity leaves EMCOR with approximately $1.021 billion of available credit at March 31. Such liquidity is additive to our cash on hand and the operating cash flow the company expects to generate in calendar 2020, resulting from the monetization of our accounts receivable and contracted assets during the ordinary course of business. Despite any concern we have regarding the impact of COVID-19 of the COVID-19 pandemic on the markets and customers we serve, we expect to continue our long trend of generating positive operating cash flow in 2020. On a trailing 12-month basis, our debt-to-EBITDA is less than one times through March 31, and albeit higher than at any point in time during the last three years, remains low. To reiterate, EMCOR's liquidity remains strong, and we continue to be well positioned to capitalize on all opportunities. With that, once again, I will turn the call back to Tony. Tony? Yes. Yes. The only thing I mean I'll state the obvious, Adam. I mean, this company has never provided quarterly earnings guidance, and we're obviously not going to start that in 2020. But to echo Tony's comments, as we continue to refine our internal forecasting, we don't see any interim periods that will not be profitable. I will put a caveat on that though, that to the extent that market conditions don't improve, there's clearly going to be some pressure on impairment analysis relative to those parts of our business that have high levels of goodwill and intangible assets. So putting that to the side, if you look at the underlying core operations of all of our subsidiaries, despite the headwinds that we're all collectively facing and at the reduced capacities, we're still anticipating being a profitable business for all of our interim reporting periods for 2020. Of course, we did not."

You can find us at emcorgroup.com. With that said, please let me turn the call over to Tony. Tony?\nAnthony Guzzi : Yes. Good morning. Thanks, Kevin, and thank you for joining us to discuss our 2021 fourth quarter and full year results. I'm going to be covering Pages 4 to 6 in my opening comments. We will also provide our guidance for 2022. I'm going to focus my initial commentary on full year 2021. My only comments for the fourth quarter of 2021 are that it went as expected. However, the impact of COVID on productivity was more pronounced than we could have contemplated in October. We performed well, but we fought through increased workplace and supply chain disruptions because of the surge in COVID cases due to the Omicron variant. Before I discuss our results, I want to thank the entire EMCOR team for their efforts in serving our customers so well during these challenging and ever-changing times. I also want to thank our leadership team down through the subsidiary level for focusing on employee safety and wellbeing, operational excellence and rigorous contingency planning. In 2021, we had our best safety year ever, with performance that will continue to place us in the top 1% of our industry. We will continue to strive every day for 0 accidents. EMCOR had an exceptional year in 2021. We earned revenues of $9.9 billion, which represents 12.6% growth over 2020 revenues. We had operating income of $530 million and operating income margin of 5.4%. We generated operating cash flow of $319 million. Overall, it was another year where the strength of our team, our diversity of end market and demand and our execution capabilities enabled us to overcome many external challenges. COVID was omnipresent, but we worked to keep our teams safe and productive. Supply chain challenges manifested themselves in many ways from uncertain prices, extended lead times and missed deliveries from our suppliers, but we persevered. Why? Because we are resilient. We have also built long-term relationships with our customers and our suppliers. We negotiate hard, but we are fair and respectful, especially in times like these. We are able to leverage such long-term relationships to foster open and transparent communications, which in turn allows us to better plan our work. I'm now going to discuss a few key drivers and results from each of our operating segments. Our Mechanical and Electrical Construction segments had outstanding years with combined operating income margins of 8.2%, which is very strong in light of the headwinds presented by supply chain constraints and COVID-induced labor productivity issues. We had 10.5% organic growth across these segments on a combined basis. Our Electrical Construction segment performance was driven by strength in the commercial market to include data centers and the resumption of demand in key markets in 2021, which were not operational for part of 2020, the institutional market and also the health care markets. Our Mechanical Construction segment also benefits -- or benefited from those things to include data centers and health care end markets, but additionally showed strength in the water and wastewater markets and the manufacturing markets. Increased demand from customers within the biotech, life sciences and pharmaceutical industries as well as the continued build-out of our customers' e-commerce supply chains further aided the performance of our Mechanical Construction segment. Our investments in prefabrication and BIM, or Building Information Modeling, continue to pay significant dividends for us. Our customers can depend on us for excellent execution on complex, fast-paced projects that require the ability to provide design-assist capability, rigorous labor planning and the ability to deliver in an uncertain supply chain environment. As shown in our remaining performance obligations, or RPOs, both segments have strong momentum going into 2022. Our U.S. Building Services segment had another strong year with a 4.8% operating income margin and 10.9% organic growth. Despite such growth, our RPOs are at record levels due to strong project demand, driven by replacement work tied to energy efficiency and indoor air quality upgrades. Our mechanical services business performed well, but faced headwinds from supply chain-induced productivity issues on small project work. Increased fuel costs additionally hindered this division's operating income margin. Our commercial site-based business had an exceptional year, driven by large contract execution as well as several successful contract startups. We leave the year in a very strong position to perform in 2022. Our Industrial Services segment performed as we expected. We saw strengthening demand through the year. We are positioned well with some of our most important customers, and we kept our best people on our team during the past 2 years of market turbulence. We built important capabilities to not only service historical demand in the refining and petrochemical end markets, but also service the renewable energy and renewable fuels market. In a tough market that requires steadfast decision-making, we're strong, can become stronger, and we did. Our U.K. business had another terrific year with excellent contract and specialized project execution, resulting in organic revenue growth of over 18% and an operating income margin of 5.5%. This team has used our organic investment capital well. We leave the year with $5.6 billion in remaining performance obligations, a $1.0 billion increase over the previous year. We have a stellar balance sheet with the ability to support our strong organic growth and investments in acquisitions. And we have a team that wins in the most arduous and challenging circumstances. And with that, Mark, I will turn it over to you to go through the financial results.\nMark Pompa : Right. Thanks a lot, Tony, and good morning to everyone participating on the call today. For those accessing this presentation via the webcast, we are now on Slide 7. Over the next several slides, I will provide a detailed discussion of our fourth quarter results as well as a summary update of our full year performance, some of which Tony just outlined during his opening commentary. As a reminder, all financial information discussed during this morning's call is included in our consolidated financial statements within both our earnings release announcement and Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier today. So let's discuss EMCOR's fourth quarter performance. Consolidated revenues of $2.64 billion are up $358.7 million or 15.7% from the fourth quarter of 2020. Excluding $63.1 million of incremental revenues attributable to businesses acquired pertaining to the time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in last year's quarter, revenues for the fourth quarter of 2021 increased approximately $296 million or 13% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. We experienced strong revenue growth from all of our reportable segments during the quarter with specific segment performance as follows. United States Electrical Construction segment revenues of $541.9 million increased $80.1 million or 17.3% from quarter 4, 2020. Excluding incremental acquisition revenues of $48.5 million, this segment's revenues grew organically 6.8% quarter-over-quarter. Increased project activity within the commercial and health care market sectors were the primary drivers of the period-over-period improvement. United States Mechanical Construction revenues of $1.06 billion increased $91.2 million or 9.4% from quarter 4, 2020. Revenue growth during the quarter was derived from the majority of the market sectors we serve, with manufacturing and health care project activity representing the most significant period-over-period increases. With respect to the manufacturing market sector and as commented during our third quarter's earnings conference call, we're actively engaged in the construction of certain large food processing plants, which will continue to accelerate as we move through 2022. From a health care perspective, we continue to see strong demand for our services as our customers retrofit or replace their mechanical systems to increase flexibility in their facilities or improve the quality of their work environments. In addition to the increased revenue experienced within these market sectors, this segment additionally benefited from incremental revenue within the water and wastewater market sector, driven by several large construction projects currently underway. Revenue gains of this segment were partially offset by quarterly revenue decline within the institutional market sector due to the completion of several projects in 2020's fourth quarter. Both our Electrical Construction and Mechanical Construction segments established new all-time quarterly revenue record levels with their fourth quarter performance. EMCOR's total domestic Construction fourth quarter revenues of $1.6 billion increased $171.3 million or 12%, with 8.6% of such revenue growth being organic. This combined Construction revenue performance represents the third consecutive quarter where we have eclipsed the previous all-time quarterly revenue record established by this group. Even with this record revenue performance, each of our Construction segments have increased the remaining performance obligations year-over-year, which Tony just commented on and will discuss further when he goes through our RPO development a little later on our call this morning. United States Building Services segment revenues of $630.1 million increased $59.2 million or 10.4%. Excluding incremental acquisition revenues of $14.6 million, this segment's revenues increased 7.8% organically. Revenue gains were reported within most of their operating divisions, with their mobile mechanical and commercial site-based services divisions reporting the largest increases. Greater project and service activities with a focus on building controls and energy efficiency were the primary drivers for the quarterly revenue growth within the mobile mechanical services group, while the growth in commercial site-based services was due to new customer additions as well as the expansion of certain services for existing customers. EMCOR's Industrial Services segment revenues of $283.6 million increased $119.3 million or 72.6% due to improved demand for both field and shop services as we continue to experience some resumption of maintenance and capital spending in the energy sector, which we started to see during the third quarter of 2021. United Kingdom Building Services segment revenues of $123.9 million increased $8.9 million or 7.7% from last year's fourth quarter. Revenue gains resulted from the continuation of strong project demand from this segment's customers, who previously deferred such work during 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the prolonged lockdowns mandated by the U.K. government. Please turn to Slide 8. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $260 million represent 9.8% of fourth quarter revenues and compare to $244.6 million or 10.7% of revenues in the year-ago period. 2021 fourth quarter includes approximately $7.1 million of incremental expenses from businesses acquired, inclusive of intangible asset amortization, resulting in an organic quarter-over-quarter increase in SG&A of $8.3 million. Consistent with my commentary during both our second and third quarter earnings calls, 2020 benefited from substantial cost reductions resulting from our actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant percentage of such savings pertains to employment costs, including furloughs, headcount reductions and temporary salary reductions. Conversely and not to be redundant with my prior quarter's commentary, EMCOR's considerable revenue growth in 2021 has necessitated an increase in headcount. Our SG&A for 2021's fourth quarter additionally reflects an increase in health care costs as a result of a normalization in the level of medical claims as well as the impact of COVID-19-related testing, illnesses and treatments. We have also seen an increase in travel and entertainment expenses due to the continued resumption of normal business activities and have incurred incremental expenses to support various information technology and cybersecurity initiatives. The reduction in SG&A as a percentage of revenues is a result of the aforementioned increase in quarterly revenues without a commensurate increase in certain of our overhead costs as we were able to successfully leverage our cost structure during this period of strong organic growth. Reported operating income for the quarter of $143 million or 5.4% of revenues compares to operating income of $137.6 million or 6% of revenues in 2020's fourth quarter. The 60 basis point reduction in operating margin is due to a reduction in gross profit margin within each of our domestic reportable segments due to a less favorable revenue mix quarter-over-quarter, which I will expand on during my individual segment commentary. Despite this reduction in quarter-over-quarter operating margin, EMCOR's $143 million of operating income represents a new all-time quarterly record. Specific quarterly performance by segment is as follows. Our U.S. Electrical Construction segment operating income of $41.3 million decreased $2.6 million from the comparable 2020 period. Reported operating margin of 7.6% represents a reduction from the 9.5% reported in 2020's fourth quarter. The decrease in both operating income and operating margin is due to declines in gross profit and gross profit margin within the commercial and transportation market sectors, given a change in composition of project work performed quarter-over-quarter. In addition, this segment experienced an increase in quarterly SG&A expenses, the majority of which was a result of incremental expenses resulting from acquisitions, including amortization of identifiable intangible assets. Fourth quarter operating income of our United States Mechanical Construction Services segment of $92.6 million represents a $7.8 million decrease from last year's quarter. And operating margin of 8.7% represents 170 basis point reduction from the strong 10.4% earned in 2020's fourth quarter. Whereas the results for the prior year's quarter benefited from the favorable closeout of several major projects within the commercial and manufacturing market sectors, the results of Q4 2021 included increased revenues from certain large projects within the manufacturing and water and wastewater market sectors for which we are acting as either the general contractor or the construction manager and therefore carry lower-than-average gross profit margins than are typical for this segment. As I stated last quarter, while we saw some operating margin compression on a comparative basis, at a combined 8.4% operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2021, our U.S. Construction operations still generated margins greater than both the 3-year and 5-year averages. Operating income for U.S. Building Services is $27.8 million, which is consistent with the fourth quarter of 2020, while operating margin of 4.4% represents a 50 basis point reduction quarter-over-quarter. This segment's mobile mechanical services division continues to work through a larger number of fixed-price capital projects, which traditionally have a lower gross profit margin profile when compared to the segment's callout service and small project work. Additionally, while we continue to attempt to mitigate the effects of supply chain disruptions by leveraging our relationships with our suppliers and customers and through enhanced labor planning and project scheduling, this segment experienced some productivity impacts resulting from longer material and equipment lead times during the quarter. Our U.S. Industrial Services segment operating income of approximately $4 million represents a $12.6 million improvement from the $8.6 million loss reported in 2020's fourth quarter. Although an improvement, this segment continues to be performing below historical levels of profitability due to the remaining headwinds in the oil and gas industry, which has suppressed maintenance and capital spending and has resulted in continued pricing pressure. However, as stated in my revenue commentary, we have seen some positive movement in each of the last 2 quarters and are cautiously optimistic for 2022 and beyond. U.K. Building Services operating income of approximately $5 million or 4% of revenues represents an increase of $740,000 and a 30 basis point improvement in operating margin quarter-over-quarter. This improvement is due to an increase in project activity primarily within the commercial market sector. We are now on Slide 9. Additional financial items of significance for the quarter not addressed on the previous slides are as follows. Quarter 4 gross profit of $403 million is higher than the comparable prior year quarter by $19.2 million or 5%. However, gross margin of 15.3% is lower than the 16.8% in last year's fourth quarter primarily as a result of the shifts in revenue mix in each of our U.S. Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments as well as our U.S. Building Services segment as I just referenced during my segment operating income discussion. We had no restructuring expenses for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to $1.6 million recorded in 2020's fourth quarter. Diluted earnings per common share of $1.89 represents a new quarterly record for the company and compares to $1.45 per diluted share in last year's fourth quarter. Adjusting 2020's EPS for the negative impact on the prior year's income tax rate resulting from the nondeductible portion of 2020's impairment charges, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2020, was $1.86. When compared to the current quarter, we are reporting a $0.03 or 1.6% quarter-over-quarter earnings per share improving, 1.6%. Please turn to Slide 10. With the fourth quarter commentary complete, I will now augment Tony's introductory remarks on EMCOR's annual performance. Consolidated revenues of $9.9 billion represent an increase of $1.11 billion or 12.6% when compared to 2020. Our year-to-date results include $196.3 million of incremental revenues attributable to businesses acquired pertaining to the period of time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in the 2020 annual period. Acquisitions positively impacted both our United States Electrical Construction and United States Building Services segments. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired, year-to-date revenues increased a strong 10.3% organically, with all of our reportable segments reporting total and organic revenue growth year-over-year. Operating income of $530.8 million represents a substantial increase from both our GAAP and adjusted non-GAAP operating income figures for full year 2020. Year-to-date diluted earnings per share is $7.06 and represents a new full year record as well as an increase of 10.3% over 2020's adjusted non-GAAP diluted EPS of $6.40. Although not shown on this slide, our operating cash flow for 2021 is approximately $319 million. On a comparative basis, 2021's performance is significantly less than the prior year as the contraction in our 2020 revenues due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in declines in accounts receivable and contract assets, which positively affected 2020's operating cash flow. Additionally, as highlighted during the course of 2020, the prior year's operating cash flow was aided by certain government stimulus measures, which resulted in the deferral of approximately $117.5 million of nonincome-based tax payments from 2020 into both 2021 and 2022. With significant organic revenue growth in each of our reportable segments during the 2021 fourth quarter, we experienced an increase in working capital investment, which is typical for a business that is in growth mode. Please turn to Slide 11. EMCOR's balance sheet remains strong and liquid. Cash on hand has decreased by $81.5 million from year-end 2020 or $319 million of operating cash flow was offset by cash used for financing activities of $245.5 million, inclusive of $195.5 million of cash used for the repurchase of our common stock and cash used for investing activities of approximately $153 million, most notably due to payments for 8 acquisitions, net of cash acquired, totaling just over $118 million. Despite the decrease in cash on hand, working capital has increased by nearly $72 million, resulting from organic revenue growth during the period. Increases in accounts receivable and contract assets were partially offset by increases in contract liabilities, accounts payable and accrued expenses. The increase in goodwill is predominantly a result of the businesses we acquired during the 2021 period. Net identifiable intangible assets have increased by $6.5 million during 2021 as the additional intangible assets recognized in connection with the previously referenced acquisitions was largely offset by $64 million of amortization expense during the year. Total debt, exclusive of operating lease liabilities, has decreased by $14.8 million, primarily as a result of the $13.9 million required principal payment made on our term loan in December 2021. EMCOR's debt-to-capitalization ratio has reduced to 10.4% from 11.9% at year-end 2020. Our balance sheet, in conjunction with the borrowing capacity available to us under our credit agreement, will continue to enable us to invest in our business, return capital to shareholders and execute against our strategic objectives as we move into 2022 and periods beyond. With my portion of this morning's slide presentation completed, I will now return the call back to Tony. Tony?\nAnthony Guzzi : Thank you, Mark, and take a well-deserved drink of water. I'm going to be on Page 12, remaining performance obligations by segment and market sector. The fourth quarter was another strong bookings quarter for the company. In fact, we experienced project awards strength throughout the year with the RPOs growing sequentially in each quarter of 2021. As mentioned earlier, total company RPOs at the end of the fourth quarter were $5.6 billion, up $1 billion or a 22% increase over the 2020 year-end total of $4.6 billion. Organic RPO growth was a strong 18%. This strong booking activity across the company translated to a book-to-bill ratio well over 1 despite the company generating record revenues for the quarter and for the year. Combined, our 2 domestic Construction segments experienced strong construction project growth in the year, with RPOs increasing by $800 million or 21.5%. The Mechanical Construction segment saw RPOs increase by $647 million or 24%, while the Electrical Construction segment saw an increase of $156 million or a healthy 15%. U.S. Building Services saw RPO levels increase $220 million or almost 36% from the year-end 2020. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to experience widespread demand for replacement and repair projects across a wide spectrum of energy efficiency and indoor air quality products. They're being blended together now. As the virus continues to hopefully move further behind us, it looks like more and more companies are planning for their employees to return to their offices, at least based on the bookings we're seeing. So I see this demand for small project retrofits continuing through the year. Over on the right side of the page, we show RPOs broken down by market sector. We saw RPO growth in each of these sectors listed, except to the transportation area. We saw some project completions during the year. RPO growth was widespread and balanced in 2021 across most market sectors we participate in, with commercial RPOs, which for us includes data centers, increasing 29% year-over-year. Our commercial project RPO total now stands at $2.4 billion and makes up 43% of total RPOs. With regard to data centers, we have leading construction positions in 3 critical trades, the installation of complex electrical mechanical systems, certainly. But in addition, we have large-scale nationwide fire protection project capability. Over the last few years, we have strengthened our take capability through organic investment and tuck-in acquisitions. And that's resulted in strong growth for this part of our operation. And look, we have the ability to execute the most complex and demanding fire protection construction and service opportunities from a semiconductor plant, a distribution center, an office building, a hospital, basically because the nature of the union, which is a road local that travels for the most part nationwide, we can do any job anywhere. Finishing our market sector RPO growth, health care RPOs were up 21%; institutionals, up 24%; industrial manufacturing, which includes the pharma, semiconductor and food processing projects we mentioned, are up 42%. Water and wastewater is up 22%, and short duration projects are up 20%. Again, many of these short duration projects are performed by our Building Services company and also a portion of our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segment companies. From an RPO perspective, I like where we are. I like our position as we enter 2022. As I said already, I believe we have gotten more resilient and stronger in the last few years. I believe our field execution is unmatched from a customer confidence perspective, whether that be a general contractor, EPC, construction manager or facility owner or tenant. Whether it be a construction project or a service call, EMCOR companies have a demonstrated record and performance history of on-time and on-budget project and service execution, both of which have been evident over the last couple of years that have been very challenging from an execution standpoint. I'm now going to go to Page 13, and we're going to talk a little bit, like we have in the past, about the growth and resilient market sectors that we talked about. We've covered this page before, but I thought I would cover it in light of all the macro factors impacting our business today. These sectors continue to drive our strong organic growth and buoyed our business through these challenging times. Macro trends are driving these in many ways, and there's demand for EMCOR. And they're good -- and they -- sometimes they're good trends -- macro trends and, sometimes from a global perspective, they're not good trends, but they're good trends as far as EMCOR's business is concerned. These trends include digitization and cybersecurity, e-commerce, supply chain repositioning and redundancy really spurred on by geopolitical events and cost and supply uncertainty, enhanced life safety requirements, health care flexibility and expansion made real again by COVID. Energy transition and energy cost volatility also are potential disruptors that allow EMCOR to service customers. I'm going to cover each of them in turn now. If you go to data centers, what's driving that? One is just the insatiable demand to supply large hyperscale data centers to support all kind of digitization efforts, whether it be e-commerce, AI or just protecting yourself from a cyber basis as more and more people move things into the cloud supported by big companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft that really -- and the large companies are building their own data centers that lead to centralization. We have that capability in many parts of the country and really into the growth markets. And we support it with the electrical, mechanical and fire protection trades. Warehousing. On the construction side, as far as electrical/mechanical, we weren't doing much, but we've always done a lot on the fire protection side. We're the best in the business when it comes to e-commerce and large-scale warehousing on a fire protection basis, bar none. We're helping continue to build out both the cold e-commerce chain and the standard e-commerce chains in the fire protection. We're also moving more into the electrical business with these warehousing because some of the larger warehouses, especially with the Amazons of the world, are also putting charging stations in, which when you build at scale for delivery trucks is a fairly complex electrical project that require substation and enhanced switchgear. Industrial manufacturing, this has been one of the biggest shifts in our business. As one of our folks said this morning, if you go back 10 or 15 years, a lot of our electrical/mechanical work was developer-based business, doing commercial office buildings. That is no -- we still know how to do that, but that is no longer the case. We are big time into electrical and industrial and manufacturing. We're supporting the semiconductor build-out in most of the critical markets mechanically and, in some places, electrically. We're supporting -- and fire protection. We're supporting the pharma rebuild here in the U.S. We're supporting the battery plants in the U.S. We're supporting the electrification as we move through this energy transition. So industrial manufacturing have become a big deal. And in industrial, we continue to support our existing process industry customers in a large way in refining, petrochemical, paper, cement, tires, pick one. Health care. I think we proved our mettle over many years in health care. And I think our customers appreciated even more what we can do through COVID. We were able to help people on the fly make their facilities more flexible. And we did it with precision, and we did it with low-cost solutions. And then really what's happening in health care right now is you're seeing more and more demand for flexible systems. And you're seeing really capacity expansion. I think a lot of towns and cities realize they've taken too much health care capacity out. And water and wastewater, we're in the best market in the country, and that would be Florida, not only for Everglades restoration, but also just supporting the growth of the population, especially in South Florida. And we've got one of the best in the business down there with Pat Carr and his team in Poole & Kent. Mechanical services is ubiquitous. Our mechanical services operations are supporting energy efficiency, indoor air quality upgrades. Our team was ready when COVID hit. Our team has been ready for years and has been executing for years on energy efficiency upgrade. Almost any retrofit project we do has an element of energy savings and is really helping buildings become more efficient, greener and more productive for the owners. And now you add in indoor air quality, as like I said -- you've heard me say before, we spent 15 years, 20 years taking outside air out of buildings. In the last 2 years, we've been figuring out how to put inside -- outside air back into the buildings, but also continue to battle the energy efficiency as we do that. And nobody is better in the business, and no one has the footprint we have to do it. And then add on to that, some of the renewable projects we do, especially in -- out West to add small-scale solar, to add on-site solar and on-site generation of other fuel sources, we have a complete offering. Indoor air quality, I talked about. And again, fire protection is ubiquitous. We are the best in the business in fire protection. And we've got some of the best operators in the industry that really set the tone for the industry. And I'm thankful every day that they're part of our team. On Page 14, I'm going to switch there and talk about EMCOR capital allocation trends. There is no trend is what I would offer. We look at this in 5- and 6-year snapshots. And to me, and I think to Mark, the most important bar is the bar all the way over on the right, which just show what we've done on a 6-year average. And that plus or minus 5% is what we would look at for right now is, in a lot of ways, optimal capital allocation for our kind of business in these kind of markets. So what are we trying to accomplish in our capital allocation? Look, we love to fund organic growth. And we've really grown like crazy in our Construction businesses and our mechanical services business. Think about it. We've had organic growth despite shrinking in our Industrial Services segment over the last couple of years. And that is really a testament to our ability to serve those projects I talked about on the previous page. We love to fund internal capital expenditures. In our mind, we do that for 2 reasons. We do it for productivity, or we do it to facilitate growth. An example of that might be a fire protection fabrication shop strategically positioned in growth markets that allow us to get a cost advantage and even serve our customers better. And acquisitions are a priority for us. And we talked long through the years about what kind we do. We've been very successful over the last 5 years. And what I'm saying is more of the core, continuing to execute, adding great capability and great people and great companies. But we also believe in returning cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In an ideal world, we're investing 55% to 70% of our capital into the business for growth and productivity. And growth can come both organic or through acquisition, and the balance returned to shareholders. That formula has proven to be a winning formula for EMCOR. And now I'm going to close, and that will be on Page 15 and 16. As we develop our initial guidance, a lot of times, we're faced with, especially in the last couple of years, a lot of uncertainty in the external environment. I don't know about you. I was certainly hoping that 2022 would have a lot less uncertainty. And clearly, when you're faced with a lot of uncertainty, it behooves all of us to take a good hard look at what the lower and upper ends of a guidance range could be. And it behooves all of us to think conservatively about how the business can execute with all those uncertainties out there. So our initial guidance will be $10.4 billion to $10.7 billion in revenues and $7.15 to $7.85 in earnings per diluted share. We do expect the nonresidential market to grow in the low to mid-single digits. We do expect more normalized demand from our refining and petrochemical customers. And we expect to continue to see all the things we talked about, small projects on the previous page. We also have captured in our guidance, I think, some continued disruption from macro factors like inflation, supply chain and COVID. And as within prior years, where we end up in the range will depend on several factors. Some of them are in our control, and some of them are outside of our control. I'd like to talk about first the things that are within our control. We have a track record, I think, over a very long time of doing a really good job controlling costs as best we can. But supply chain issues and COVID will continue to be wildcards. COVID testing cost could be a wildcard as we are self-insured outside of our union plans. And the President's executive order on home testing is quite broad with little or no qualification as far as people procuring supply. I do expect continuing headwinds from fuel costs as the -- and the Ukrainian crisis showed that today. And I think we captured most of those headwinds in our guidance. I think we will continue to work -- win work, and we'll continue to be disciplined in our estimating and pricing. I like where our backlog is, and I like where our backlog is priced today. We will continue to emphasize the areas where we have differentiated expertise. And we talked about those on the previous page. We will continue to lead the way on safety at all levels of the organization. However, there are more than a few things that are outside of our control. And I'm going to ask a question and then answer for you how we see it. Will the supply chain get better or worse? Personally, I expect little to no improvement in the supply chain as the year progresses. Some areas will improve, and others will worsen. Will COVID have another resurgence? I have no idea. I don't know, but we'll continue -- I know what we will do is we'll continue to keep our people as safe as we can. We'll follow protocols that are prescribed to us, and we'll work as hard as we can to remain as productive as we can. Will customer decision-making slow due to all this uncertainty? Quite frankly, I don't think so on large complex projects, especially the ones that have to do with global supply chain repositioning, reshoring, health care, food processing, semiconductors or life safety or pharma. So the major markets that we're playing in today, I do not expect customer decision-making to slow. I think it is going to require more planning upfront in these uncertain supply chains. We see that already. That's good for us. We have the people that know how to do that thorough planning, and they're expert in contingency planning. In fact, we've gotten a little too good at contingency planning the last couple of years with all the uncertainty. What will happen with inflation? I think it may moderate as the year progresses, but I think it will be up into the right. And energy markets are as volatile as I have ever seen in my career. As we move into 2022, as I covered on the previous page, we will continue to be disciplined capital allocators in terms of our organic investments, acquisitions and the return of cash to our shareholders, all of which are important uses of our capital. As always, I thank you. I thank our employees and our leaders. Thank you for your interest in EMCOR. And with that, we'll be happy to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nSean Eastman: So just starting high level for me, you guys have grown EPS comfortably in the double digits every single year for the past 7 years in a row. We're going into 2022. We've got big momentum in the RPOs. Industrial Services seems to be inflecting positively. You've got a fortressed balance sheet, but the midpoint of the earnings growth outlook is 6%. So I hear the risk factors, Tony, but maybe just more specifically, how do we wrap our heads around that? Like where is the real sort of contingency built into that initial outlook?\nAnthony Guzzi : Look, Sean, I think contingency -- and I'll ask Mark to help me here. The way I think about it is it's a macro-driven view. If we do better against those macro items, then we'll move up in the range, and I went through that. So what concerns me, I think any CEO right now, if you're not concerned about supply chain and the unpredictability in the supply chain and what that can do to your labor productivity, then you're not being careful. I think fuel costs and energy costs are a real wildcard. I thought they were wildcard going into last year. And certainly, what's happened over the last week has certainly not cleared up the energy picture any better for anybody, like we do, that operates a large fleet. We will do our damn best to pass those costs on to our customers. But remember, we're always doing that in arrears. We can't guess at a fuel price, pass it on to our customers and what largely -- where that most is impacted is a time and material business. And finally, we took a -- COVID took a whack at our productivity in the fourth quarter. And do I think that's abating? Sure, I do. Do I know it's abating for the year? I don't know. We thought -- I think we had a victory speech last July, and then we had Delta. And then we had another moment of glee, and then we had Omicron. I am not an epidemiologist, never have been. I do know a little bit about numbers. I have no idea what's going to happen. So I think if you take those potential factors into play, you can end up in a place to say, \"Hey, we're going to do well, but maybe not as well as we should have.\" We feel really good about where our RPOs are. We really feel good about the demand in our end markets. But at the end of the day, we've got to execute in a world of uncertain labor productivity because of COVID, an uncertain material availability because of supply chain. Mark?\nMark Pompa: Yes, Sean, the only thing I would add to Tony's commentary has to do around mix of revenue. As Tony commented earlier in this morning's call about how we've moved to a more larger project away from traditional commercial work, well, obviously, when you're project planning that larger, more complex work, you have more contingencies built into your estimates. We're on the front end of a lot of that work as we enter 2022. Assuming that the project schedules adhere to what was originally anticipated, we're certainly going to have a lot better feel ultimately for the profitability of those jobs as we progress through the full year calendar. But if the supply chain does continue to rear its ugly head, those project completion time lines might slide into 2023, therefore adding more uncertainty to our estimates. So the work is there. The profitability characteristics have not changed to our detriment. Unfortunately, though, a lot of the uncertainty around the work and how it's going to progress, which is beyond our control, certainly builds in some element of conservatism.\nAnthony Guzzi : Yes. And Mark, we're working with really rational people right now at the owner and GC and CM level. But they also don't control the supply chain issues. The only thing I'll take exception, Sean, when you asked your question, when you said we've comfortably grown EPS double digits, maybe we've been grinding and our folks have worked exceptionally hard to do that. So maybe in a virtual work-from-home environment, it's been comfortable EPS growth. But I can tell you, I couldn't be more proud of how our people have executed to put the kind of results we've had in a very challenging environment over the last 2.5 years.\nSean Eastman: Yes. Super helpful. I didn't mean to suggest it was comfortable. I just meant comfortably within the double digits, not that it was a...\nAnthony Guzzi : I had to brag on my people here a little bit and the great work...\nSean Eastman: No, please by all means. And my second question is, obviously, the RPO growth was a big positive story for you guys throughout 2021. Do you expect that momentum in RPOs to continue this year? I'm just wondering if maybe there might have been a little bit of pull forward in new award activity just as project sponsors looked to secure that contractor capacity. Curious your thoughts there.\nAnthony Guzzi : It's actually -- we worry about the same observation, Sean, that people want to secure capacity with really blue-chip contractors right now, which I do think there's been a flight to quality. However, if you go back to that page where I talked about those resilient markets, I think we've grown 9 of the last 12 quarters RPOs, which is not that common for us. This could be lumpy. It comes in and it comes out. One large project can move it one way or another. I do think, though, there's enough significant opportunities out there that we're involved on the front end, and we'll see when they get awarded. It could be a little lumpy. But I feel really good about the opportunities we have in the pipeline that may materialize into significant projects. And we're working as part of a team, right? The project is going to happen, it's just when. And we're 1 of 2 teams that may or may not win it. So the odds are fairly good on some of those projects. Secondarily, I think one of the things I always look at in the business is what's happening in 2 parts of the business to tell you whether momentum may be a little more broad-based. One of the things we look at is our small project work, which is very strong right now. And so it's saying people are not only spending at the top of the market, they're also spending things they need to do to maintain their facilities, gain energy efficiency and get better indoor air quality in their buildings. So we're seeing that. Secondarily, I always watch the fire protection business and the fire protection business, because it's a national business, involved in every sector of construction for us. It remains very strong. Now part of that is our position in the market. But the other part of that is it's sort of a national view on some of the more complex work, and that continues strong. I do think one of the things that's going to continue to drive people maybe to want to make decisions is what I said in my closing. And that is that a lot of these decisions have to be made. People are still well capitalized. And the kind of people we work for, for the most part -- I mean sometimes maybe we thought they were better capitalized than they are, but that's not very often. They need to get this work done. There's a major repositioning going on to support the new investments in the energy transition, but there's also a major repositioning on traditional supply chain that, quite frankly, I haven't -- I only saw my career on the way out, where people were moving from high-cost states to low-cost states and maybe to Mexico and eventually out to Asia. Now you're seeing it in reverse, still going to lower-cost states. And we've really made some pressured investments in there in the mid-2000s and in the last 3 or 4 years, and we sort of got ahead of the curve.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Noelle Dilts with Stifel.\nNoelle Dilts: So maybe a bit too detailed, but I was wondering if you could talk about how you're thinking about sort of expected segment margin ranges embedded in your guidance in '22. When I look at 2021, your margins really held in pretty well in all of the segments, with the exception of Industrial. So I'm just really trying to get a sense of how do we think about Electrical and Mechanical margins going forward? And then with Industrial, obviously, you go back quite a few years, but we were talking about mid-single-digit levels. When can we think about that division maybe getting back toward those mid-single-digit types of -- mid-single-digit type of range.\nAnthony Guzzi : So I'll take a shot at a macro level, and then will kick to Mark relatively quickly here. I think that we're very comfortable thinking we can operate within our 3-year averages on all of our segments with the exception of Industrial. There, we expect...\nMark Pompa: To be better.\nAnthony Guzzi : To be better. And 3-year averages for us can have 40 to 50 basis points of flux in it, right, Mark? And it's not a quarter-to-quarter business. And like Mark said, some of it has the timing on large projects, when they end, when they start, the contingencies built in and then the acceleration of the small project portfolio. So Mark, I'll throw it to you.\nMark Pompa: Yes. Noelle, this is grounding, in fact, so to speak. So when you look at full year 2021 by segment, as I mentioned earlier, both Electrical and Mechanical Construction are operating above their 3- and 5-year averages. If you look at the back half of 2021 performance, that trend is not as consistent. So Electrical Construction's last 6 months of 2021 was actually below those averages. My anticipation, and obviously, when we did the financial modeling for purposes of 2022 planning, we're looking at -- and as Tony indicated, we're looking at margin performance consistent with really what it's been in the last 3 years. So that would put Electrical Construction around 8.25%, hopefully slightly higher. Mechanical Construction, that gets you somewhere around 7.75% to 8%. So on a blended rate, when you look at total Construction, it's just either slightly below 8% or up to 8.2%. So that's still a very good performance. When -- I think we all get jaded looking at the last few years and say, okay, that's this reality, the new reality. And as much as I think the EMCOR team would love that to be the situation, we don't control the market. And we're in a sweet spot on some things as Tony covered in depth, but that's not going to continue into perpetuity. But when you look at 2022 from a framework perspective, it doesn't look like we're going to see any softness, so to speak, with regards to demand and opportunities. When you look at our U.S. Building Services, the 2021 performance was slightly below the 3-year or 5-year average for -- once again for the reasons that we've already discussed. Clearly, supply chain difficulties have been the most impactful there. And because there's a fairly significant nonunion labor component to that segment, our ability to shift resources around is good. But if we have labor on-site and materials and equipment are not there for installation, because they're being procured by somebody other than the EMCOR subsidiary, we're still on the hook for payment for that labor, which is not obviously being very productive. So we continue to -- the project management, which is a center of excellence for EMCOR and has been for -- I don't want to say my entire history with the company, but for a long part of my history with the company. So I'd like to think that they're going to somewhere settle around that 5% range. And then as Tony indicated, Industrial, certainly, the last 3 or 4 years have been anything but steady for a lot of exterior reasons that we've discussed ad nauseam in prior calls. But their 3-year average is below 2%. I think we would be very unhappy if that's where the profitability of that segment resulted in 2022. But as we mentioned I believe in last call, as much as I like to be able to shoot back to the mid-single digits, you have to walk before you can run.\nAnthony Guzzi : Kind of get 4% first.\nMark Pompa: Yes. So we're certainly trending in that direction. But I think, unfortunately, we've all been collectively disappointed for a lot of different reasons, some through our own fault, most through others' fault. We're not ready to declare victory quite yet in that segment. But we'll obviously have more to talk about as we progress through the year. And the U.K. has been probably the most steady of all of our businesses when you look at variability in margins period-to-period. And they're well above their 3-year average, which is just below 5%. And we'd like to think that 5% or 5.5% range is what our expectations are certainly in the near future. So probably a long answer to a short question. But we're right where we want to be. And once again, assuming project time line, certainly on the larger work progressed as planned, we certainly would think that there's going to be opportunity for improved margin performance relative to how we closed the 2021 period, specifically looking at the back half of the year. But once again, we're going to do everything that we can to control the outcome of those things. But unfortunately, a lot of that is dictated by others and outside influences.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thompson, Davis.\nAdam Thalhimer: Nice quarter.\nAnthony Guzzi : Thanks, Adam.\nMark Pompa: Thanks, Adam.\nAdam Thalhimer: Tony, what are you guys hearing -- what are you hearing from industrial customers? I'm sorry if I missed that, but just curious what they're telling you in terms of project activity this year.\nAnthony Guzzi : Refining and petrochemical?\nAdam Thalhimer: Yes.\nAnthony Guzzi : Okay. Because we have more industrial customers than just EIS.\nAdam Thalhimer: Feel free to take it wherever you want.\nAnthony Guzzi : Well, I've covered the other ones a lot, right, in my commentary. Look...\nAdam Thalhimer: No, no, I meant the ones in the Industrial segment, correct.\nAnthony Guzzi : Yes. What we're seeing is what we expected for the first quarter, right? We said we're going to continue to sequentially get better. We've said that a number of times. I think we've called it about right. I think they're spending money again. We're clearly in a very good position. I said what I said for a very specific reason in my text. We kept the team together, which is a real credit to the leadership there. It's been a rough 2 years. But we kept the team together. They're executing. I think the year looks pretty good. It looks like a normal year of turnaround activity. Will they run harder and do less turnaround work in the fourth quarter because gas prices are so high? I don't know that. I think they're going to do their maintenance, to be honest with you. I think the other wildcard in that segment is we're not seeing it yet. We're seeing a small return to upstream. We see that in our Electrical business in that segment. I do expect and our people who know a lot more about this because they live it every day. We have experts in this. They expect somewhere around third and fourth quarter to see a resumption of drilling in the Permian and the Eagle Ford and a little bit North Dakota, the Bakken. That will help us. That's the part we don't have baked into anything yet. That would be upside into our business. So I think they're ready to spend money. I think they believe they are long-term winners, the Gulf Coast refining and petrochemical complex. Let's hope for no weather events here in hurricane season, and we should have a pretty good year.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. Super helpful. And then -- so I'm curious, with the supply chain issues and the inflation that you started to see in the back half of 2021, what did you do differently when signing new contracts? And I guess, the question is also kind of surrounding what you think your margins are in backlog and kind of how protected you are from those issues this year?\nAnthony Guzzi : Look, I think on the larger workforce protected as it can be. So here's what changed. And this changed for us in the first quarter of last year or maybe even the fourth quarter of '20 because we saw some of this coming. First thing we did is we don't let prices out there for more than -- depending on the kind of job, 7 to 20 days when before we would leave them out there 30 to 60 days. So the amount that we'll honor a quote, especially on a small project work, came in. So we can honor -- and when we do that, we typically are almost brought out on the job, which means we have commitments, especially on the small project work from our suppliers what we're going to pay. As you get to the larger work, there's a couple of different ways you contract it. And you either do it fixed price or you do it GMP, which looks like a fixed-price contract, but it has built-in negotiators for increases in materials and things like that. And more and more contracting has been happening that way on the larger projects because we can't guarantee what the price is going to be. And people are rational, and they know we're about as good as anybody in the business of procuring materials. But just as -- so there's all kind of things like that. And we have all kind of contingencies built in if deliveries don't happen that you wouldn't typically have seen in the past. And people are knowledgeable, and we do a really good job through our central procurement group of keeping lead times in front of people so that they can negotiate with their customers then about what lead times look on critical materials. So long-winded answer to how I feel about what's in backlog, I feel about as good as I could feel. I think we've done everything we can to protect ourselves. I think we priced it correctly. And I think we have as about as good terms as we can get in the environment that we're in. And I think our owners have been fair, and I think our general contractors and construction manager customers have been fair. I mean a lot of these people want us to do the job because we're going to get it done. We're going to get it done right. And we have the technical capability first, the project execution capability. We have the ability to get the labor. And quite frankly, we have the financial strength to do it. People on these large projects actually look to our balance sheet as a point of strength. And it's one of the reasons they contract with us because they know that work is going to get done. We've -- we compete with that. And secondarily, Adam, I think that the biggest wildcard for us this year is things that we don't control, right? I have no idea what's going to happen with COVID, and I'm done projecting that and predicting that. And the supply chain, it's not just pricing in the supply chain, which we can get our head around, availability is more the issue. Someone will make a promise to you. Mark talked about it a little bit. The large project work, we have the chance to sequence things different. We have a chance to lay out the workforce a little different. When you get to the smaller project work or the quick turn work, which may not be a small project where we hit up with a lot of labor, the problem we run into it, if a critical piece of equipment doesn't come in on time, that can really change things out in a retrofit environment. Because a lot of time in a retrofit environment, yes, you're competing on price sometimes, but you're really competing on the least amount of disruption to the facility to keep it operational. And you really go through -- even on a small, you go through very detailed sequencing and planning to do that. You have labor lined up to work over time. You have labor lined up to work weekends. And man, if you miss that by a day or 2, you've -- in for 8 guys, 2 days of labor, you do that over 10 projects, the math becomes sort of ugly pretty quickly. That's the biggest challenge the mechanical service business has had over the past 6 months. And they're as good as anybody in the business of figuring that out. But we have transparency with our distributors. We have this transparency with our equipment suppliers. Their factories and their OEMs disappoint them, too. And so what's causing it in the factories and the OEMs? A lot of times, it's their ability to bring in materials, but a lot of times it's disruption from COVID in their factories and they're not producing to the level they thought they were going to a mere 2 weeks earlier.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson.\nBrent Thielman: Just one last from me. Tony, I was thinking about your prepared remarks and, in particular, some of the investments you've made in the past that seem to be sort of helping you through all of that noise in the market right now inflation, et cetera. Can you talk about -- I mean just given the state of the balance sheet and perhaps less sort of attractive M&A opportunities out there right now, some of the programs or things you're putting money toward today that might benefit you in the future? I mean anything there worth talking about that...\nAnthony Guzzi : Yes, absolutely. We continue to build out our fire protection prefabrication capability. We have 4 strategically located facilities now. That will probably be 6 within -- we'll put 2 more in over the next probably 12 months. We continue to enhance our prefabrication in our mechanical and electrical operations. On the mechanical side, we probably have 12 significant shops; on the electrical side, 6. We'll take more square footage, and we'll be doing more things in the shops versus the field. And we'll be doing them on a larger scale to become more modular as we serve these larger projects. Also training, right? It's a soft cost, but it's not for us. We're going to ramp back up our executive training on our company values and our leadership and also our business acumen. We've been on a 2-year hiatus because of COVID. That will start again here in the second week of March and last week of March. We view those as critical to building our culture, which many people consider a softer investment. We do not. We consider it a hard investment. And we think that, more than anything, helped carry us through these last 2 years. We're going to continue to invest in BIM. We've actually put a couple of full-time resources. We put a terrific leader in charge of our BIM initiative. It's actually under one of our key segment leaders, Joe Burns, who runs mechanical, guides that, probably knows more about that than anybody in the industry. We've enhanced our relationship with Autodesk, and we will continue to push the frontier on our scale that we do. We will continue to do more mechanical service training. We're doing some very creative things around mechanical service training and training of our field technicians in general to bring them up. We have some virtual training that we've enhanced. And we also put more money into our applied equipment training center in Arizona, which we expect to ramp back up here in the end of the first quarter. And on the people side, we're investing in project management. So those are all the kinds of things we do, and I'm probably missing a couple of things. Those are the kinds of things we do to build capability that we hope continue to differentiate us in the market. Now look, acquisition is sort of a critical part in that, too. Sometimes we can bring all those tools to the acquisition. Sometimes we learn from the acquisition, right? It works both ways. When we bought B&K down in the Southeast, they were probably a little ahead of it. We thought we were pretty good at prefabrication. They were a little bit ahead of us, especially with some of their shop automation. We took those lessons and took them to other parts of our mechanical business. So acquisitions play a critical role in our ability to not only expand our geographic and technical reach, but also another way to learn. And then one of the big synergies you get is to take our learning, and usually, our acquisitions are hungry to get that learning from us.\nOperator: All right. I'll hand the call back to Tony Guzzi for any closing remarks.\nAnthony Guzzi: All right. Look, thank you all. Thanks for listening. And thanks to all the EMCOR folks out there listening. We're going to try to knock it here in the first quarter and hope for another great year. And we're set up to do pretty well. But hey, we'll face headwinds. We always figure out a way to get through them. With that, have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you. And that concludes the EMCOR Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Call.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Anthony Guzzi",
            "content": "Yes. Good morning. Thanks, Kevin, and thank you for joining us to discuss our 2021 fourth quarter and full year results. I'm going to be covering Pages 4 to 6 in my opening comments. We will also provide our guidance for 2022. I'm going to focus my initial commentary on full year 2021. My only comments for the fourth quarter of 2021 are that it went as expected. However, the impact of COVID on productivity was more pronounced than we could have contemplated in October. We performed well, but we fought through increased workplace and supply chain disruptions because of the surge in COVID cases due to the Omicron variant. Before I discuss our results, I want to thank the entire EMCOR team for their efforts in serving our customers so well during these challenging and ever-changing times. I also want to thank our leadership team down through the subsidiary level for focusing on employee safety and wellbeing, operational excellence and rigorous contingency planning. In 2021, we had our best safety year ever, with performance that will continue to place us in the top 1% of our industry. We will continue to strive every day for 0 accidents. EMCOR had an exceptional year in 2021. We earned revenues of $9.9 billion, which represents 12.6% growth over 2020 revenues. We had operating income of $530 million and operating income margin of 5.4%. We generated operating cash flow of $319 million. Overall, it was another year where the strength of our team, our diversity of end market and demand and our execution capabilities enabled us to overcome many external challenges. COVID was omnipresent, but we worked to keep our teams safe and productive. Supply chain challenges manifested themselves in many ways from uncertain prices, extended lead times and missed deliveries from our suppliers, but we persevered. Why? Because we are resilient. We have also built long-term relationships with our customers and our suppliers. We negotiate hard, but we are fair and respectful, especially in times like these. We are able to leverage such long-term relationships to foster open and transparent communications, which in turn allows us to better plan our work. I'm now going to discuss a few key drivers and results from each of our operating segments. Our Mechanical and Electrical Construction segments had outstanding years with combined operating income margins of 8.2%, which is very strong in light of the headwinds presented by supply chain constraints and COVID-induced labor productivity issues. We had 10.5% organic growth across these segments on a combined basis. Our Electrical Construction segment performance was driven by strength in the commercial market to include data centers and the resumption of demand in key markets in 2021, which were not operational for part of 2020, the institutional market and also the health care markets. Our Mechanical Construction segment also benefits -- or benefited from those things to include data centers and health care end markets, but additionally showed strength in the water and wastewater markets and the manufacturing markets. Increased demand from customers within the biotech, life sciences and pharmaceutical industries as well as the continued build-out of our customers' e-commerce supply chains further aided the performance of our Mechanical Construction segment. Our investments in prefabrication and BIM, or Building Information Modeling, continue to pay significant dividends for us. Our customers can depend on us for excellent execution on complex, fast-paced projects that require the ability to provide design-assist capability, rigorous labor planning and the ability to deliver in an uncertain supply chain environment. As shown in our remaining performance obligations, or RPOs, both segments have strong momentum going into 2022. Our U.S. Building Services segment had another strong year with a 4.8% operating income margin and 10.9% organic growth. Despite such growth, our RPOs are at record levels due to strong project demand, driven by replacement work tied to energy efficiency and indoor air quality upgrades. Our mechanical services business performed well, but faced headwinds from supply chain-induced productivity issues on small project work. Increased fuel costs additionally hindered this division's operating income margin. Our commercial site-based business had an exceptional year, driven by large contract execution as well as several successful contract startups. We leave the year in a very strong position to perform in 2022. Our Industrial Services segment performed as we expected. We saw strengthening demand through the year. We are positioned well with some of our most important customers, and we kept our best people on our team during the past 2 years of market turbulence. We built important capabilities to not only service historical demand in the refining and petrochemical end markets, but also service the renewable energy and renewable fuels market. In a tough market that requires steadfast decision-making, we're strong, can become stronger, and we did. Our U.K. business had another terrific year with excellent contract and specialized project execution, resulting in organic revenue growth of over 18% and an operating income margin of 5.5%. This team has used our organic investment capital well. We leave the year with $5.6 billion in remaining performance obligations, a $1.0 billion increase over the previous year. We have a stellar balance sheet with the ability to support our strong organic growth and investments in acquisitions. And we have a team that wins in the most arduous and challenging circumstances. And with that, Mark, I will turn it over to you to go through the financial results. Thank you, Mark, and take a well-deserved drink of water. I'm going to be on Page 12, remaining performance obligations by segment and market sector. The fourth quarter was another strong bookings quarter for the company. In fact, we experienced project awards strength throughout the year with the RPOs growing sequentially in each quarter of 2021. As mentioned earlier, total company RPOs at the end of the fourth quarter were $5.6 billion, up $1 billion or a 22% increase over the 2020 year-end total of $4.6 billion. Organic RPO growth was a strong 18%. This strong booking activity across the company translated to a book-to-bill ratio well over 1 despite the company generating record revenues for the quarter and for the year. Combined, our 2 domestic Construction segments experienced strong construction project growth in the year, with RPOs increasing by $800 million or 21.5%. The Mechanical Construction segment saw RPOs increase by $647 million or 24%, while the Electrical Construction segment saw an increase of $156 million or a healthy 15%. U.S. Building Services saw RPO levels increase $220 million or almost 36% from the year-end 2020. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to experience widespread demand for replacement and repair projects across a wide spectrum of energy efficiency and indoor air quality products. They're being blended together now. As the virus continues to hopefully move further behind us, it looks like more and more companies are planning for their employees to return to their offices, at least based on the bookings we're seeing. So I see this demand for small project retrofits continuing through the year. Over on the right side of the page, we show RPOs broken down by market sector. We saw RPO growth in each of these sectors listed, except to the transportation area. We saw some project completions during the year. RPO growth was widespread and balanced in 2021 across most market sectors we participate in, with commercial RPOs, which for us includes data centers, increasing 29% year-over-year. Our commercial project RPO total now stands at $2.4 billion and makes up 43% of total RPOs. With regard to data centers, we have leading construction positions in 3 critical trades, the installation of complex electrical mechanical systems, certainly. But in addition, we have large-scale nationwide fire protection project capability. Over the last few years, we have strengthened our take capability through organic investment and tuck-in acquisitions. And that's resulted in strong growth for this part of our operation. And look, we have the ability to execute the most complex and demanding fire protection construction and service opportunities from a semiconductor plant, a distribution center, an office building, a hospital, basically because the nature of the union, which is a road local that travels for the most part nationwide, we can do any job anywhere. Finishing our market sector RPO growth, health care RPOs were up 21%; institutionals, up 24%; industrial manufacturing, which includes the pharma, semiconductor and food processing projects we mentioned, are up 42%. Water and wastewater is up 22%, and short duration projects are up 20%. Again, many of these short duration projects are performed by our Building Services company and also a portion of our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segment companies. From an RPO perspective, I like where we are. I like our position as we enter 2022. As I said already, I believe we have gotten more resilient and stronger in the last few years. I believe our field execution is unmatched from a customer confidence perspective, whether that be a general contractor, EPC, construction manager or facility owner or tenant. Whether it be a construction project or a service call, EMCOR companies have a demonstrated record and performance history of on-time and on-budget project and service execution, both of which have been evident over the last couple of years that have been very challenging from an execution standpoint. I'm now going to go to Page 13, and we're going to talk a little bit, like we have in the past, about the growth and resilient market sectors that we talked about. We've covered this page before, but I thought I would cover it in light of all the macro factors impacting our business today. These sectors continue to drive our strong organic growth and buoyed our business through these challenging times. Macro trends are driving these in many ways, and there's demand for EMCOR. And they're good -- and they -- sometimes they're good trends -- macro trends and, sometimes from a global perspective, they're not good trends, but they're good trends as far as EMCOR's business is concerned. These trends include digitization and cybersecurity, e-commerce, supply chain repositioning and redundancy really spurred on by geopolitical events and cost and supply uncertainty, enhanced life safety requirements, health care flexibility and expansion made real again by COVID. Energy transition and energy cost volatility also are potential disruptors that allow EMCOR to service customers. I'm going to cover each of them in turn now. If you go to data centers, what's driving that? One is just the insatiable demand to supply large hyperscale data centers to support all kind of digitization efforts, whether it be e-commerce, AI or just protecting yourself from a cyber basis as more and more people move things into the cloud supported by big companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft that really -- and the large companies are building their own data centers that lead to centralization. We have that capability in many parts of the country and really into the growth markets. And we support it with the electrical, mechanical and fire protection trades. Warehousing. On the construction side, as far as electrical/mechanical, we weren't doing much, but we've always done a lot on the fire protection side. We're the best in the business when it comes to e-commerce and large-scale warehousing on a fire protection basis, bar none. We're helping continue to build out both the cold e-commerce chain and the standard e-commerce chains in the fire protection. We're also moving more into the electrical business with these warehousing because some of the larger warehouses, especially with the Amazons of the world, are also putting charging stations in, which when you build at scale for delivery trucks is a fairly complex electrical project that require substation and enhanced switchgear. Industrial manufacturing, this has been one of the biggest shifts in our business. As one of our folks said this morning, if you go back 10 or 15 years, a lot of our electrical/mechanical work was developer-based business, doing commercial office buildings. That is no -- we still know how to do that, but that is no longer the case. We are big time into electrical and industrial and manufacturing. We're supporting the semiconductor build-out in most of the critical markets mechanically and, in some places, electrically. We're supporting -- and fire protection. We're supporting the pharma rebuild here in the U.S. We're supporting the battery plants in the U.S. We're supporting the electrification as we move through this energy transition. So industrial manufacturing have become a big deal. And in industrial, we continue to support our existing process industry customers in a large way in refining, petrochemical, paper, cement, tires, pick one. Health care. I think we proved our mettle over many years in health care. And I think our customers appreciated even more what we can do through COVID. We were able to help people on the fly make their facilities more flexible. And we did it with precision, and we did it with low-cost solutions. And then really what's happening in health care right now is you're seeing more and more demand for flexible systems. And you're seeing really capacity expansion. I think a lot of towns and cities realize they've taken too much health care capacity out. And water and wastewater, we're in the best market in the country, and that would be Florida, not only for Everglades restoration, but also just supporting the growth of the population, especially in South Florida. And we've got one of the best in the business down there with Pat Carr and his team in Poole & Kent. Mechanical services is ubiquitous. Our mechanical services operations are supporting energy efficiency, indoor air quality upgrades. Our team was ready when COVID hit. Our team has been ready for years and has been executing for years on energy efficiency upgrade. Almost any retrofit project we do has an element of energy savings and is really helping buildings become more efficient, greener and more productive for the owners. And now you add in indoor air quality, as like I said -- you've heard me say before, we spent 15 years, 20 years taking outside air out of buildings. In the last 2 years, we've been figuring out how to put inside -- outside air back into the buildings, but also continue to battle the energy efficiency as we do that. And nobody is better in the business, and no one has the footprint we have to do it. And then add on to that, some of the renewable projects we do, especially in -- out West to add small-scale solar, to add on-site solar and on-site generation of other fuel sources, we have a complete offering. Indoor air quality, I talked about. And again, fire protection is ubiquitous. We are the best in the business in fire protection. And we've got some of the best operators in the industry that really set the tone for the industry. And I'm thankful every day that they're part of our team. On Page 14, I'm going to switch there and talk about EMCOR capital allocation trends. There is no trend is what I would offer. We look at this in 5- and 6-year snapshots. And to me, and I think to Mark, the most important bar is the bar all the way over on the right, which just show what we've done on a 6-year average. And that plus or minus 5% is what we would look at for right now is, in a lot of ways, optimal capital allocation for our kind of business in these kind of markets. So what are we trying to accomplish in our capital allocation? Look, we love to fund organic growth. And we've really grown like crazy in our Construction businesses and our mechanical services business. Think about it. We've had organic growth despite shrinking in our Industrial Services segment over the last couple of years. And that is really a testament to our ability to serve those projects I talked about on the previous page. We love to fund internal capital expenditures. In our mind, we do that for 2 reasons. We do it for productivity, or we do it to facilitate growth. An example of that might be a fire protection fabrication shop strategically positioned in growth markets that allow us to get a cost advantage and even serve our customers better. And acquisitions are a priority for us. And we talked long through the years about what kind we do. We've been very successful over the last 5 years. And what I'm saying is more of the core, continuing to execute, adding great capability and great people and great companies. But we also believe in returning cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In an ideal world, we're investing 55% to 70% of our capital into the business for growth and productivity. And growth can come both organic or through acquisition, and the balance returned to shareholders. That formula has proven to be a winning formula for EMCOR. And now I'm going to close, and that will be on Page 15 and 16. As we develop our initial guidance, a lot of times, we're faced with, especially in the last couple of years, a lot of uncertainty in the external environment. I don't know about you. I was certainly hoping that 2022 would have a lot less uncertainty. And clearly, when you're faced with a lot of uncertainty, it behooves all of us to take a good hard look at what the lower and upper ends of a guidance range could be. And it behooves all of us to think conservatively about how the business can execute with all those uncertainties out there. So our initial guidance will be $10.4 billion to $10.7 billion in revenues and $7.15 to $7.85 in earnings per diluted share. We do expect the nonresidential market to grow in the low to mid-single digits. We do expect more normalized demand from our refining and petrochemical customers. And we expect to continue to see all the things we talked about, small projects on the previous page. We also have captured in our guidance, I think, some continued disruption from macro factors like inflation, supply chain and COVID. And as within prior years, where we end up in the range will depend on several factors. Some of them are in our control, and some of them are outside of our control. I'd like to talk about first the things that are within our control. We have a track record, I think, over a very long time of doing a really good job controlling costs as best we can. But supply chain issues and COVID will continue to be wildcards. COVID testing cost could be a wildcard as we are self-insured outside of our union plans. And the President's executive order on home testing is quite broad with little or no qualification as far as people procuring supply. I do expect continuing headwinds from fuel costs as the -- and the Ukrainian crisis showed that today. And I think we captured most of those headwinds in our guidance. I think we will continue to work -- win work, and we'll continue to be disciplined in our estimating and pricing. I like where our backlog is, and I like where our backlog is priced today. We will continue to emphasize the areas where we have differentiated expertise. And we talked about those on the previous page. We will continue to lead the way on safety at all levels of the organization. However, there are more than a few things that are outside of our control. And I'm going to ask a question and then answer for you how we see it. Will the supply chain get better or worse? Personally, I expect little to no improvement in the supply chain as the year progresses. Some areas will improve, and others will worsen. Will COVID have another resurgence? I have no idea. I don't know, but we'll continue -- I know what we will do is we'll continue to keep our people as safe as we can. We'll follow protocols that are prescribed to us, and we'll work as hard as we can to remain as productive as we can. Will customer decision-making slow due to all this uncertainty? Quite frankly, I don't think so on large complex projects, especially the ones that have to do with global supply chain repositioning, reshoring, health care, food processing, semiconductors or life safety or pharma. So the major markets that we're playing in today, I do not expect customer decision-making to slow. I think it is going to require more planning upfront in these uncertain supply chains. We see that already. That's good for us. We have the people that know how to do that thorough planning, and they're expert in contingency planning. In fact, we've gotten a little too good at contingency planning the last couple of years with all the uncertainty. What will happen with inflation? I think it may moderate as the year progresses, but I think it will be up into the right. And energy markets are as volatile as I have ever seen in my career. As we move into 2022, as I covered on the previous page, we will continue to be disciplined capital allocators in terms of our organic investments, acquisitions and the return of cash to our shareholders, all of which are important uses of our capital. As always, I thank you. I thank our employees and our leaders. Thank you for your interest in EMCOR. And with that, we'll be happy to take questions. Look, Sean, I think contingency -- and I'll ask Mark to help me here. The way I think about it is it's a macro-driven view. If we do better against those macro items, then we'll move up in the range, and I went through that. So what concerns me, I think any CEO right now, if you're not concerned about supply chain and the unpredictability in the supply chain and what that can do to your labor productivity, then you're not being careful. I think fuel costs and energy costs are a real wildcard. I thought they were wildcard going into last year. And certainly, what's happened over the last week has certainly not cleared up the energy picture any better for anybody, like we do, that operates a large fleet. We will do our damn best to pass those costs on to our customers. But remember, we're always doing that in arrears. We can't guess at a fuel price, pass it on to our customers and what largely -- where that most is impacted is a time and material business. And finally, we took a -- COVID took a whack at our productivity in the fourth quarter. And do I think that's abating? Sure, I do. Do I know it's abating for the year? I don't know. We thought -- I think we had a victory speech last July, and then we had Delta. And then we had another moment of glee, and then we had Omicron. I am not an epidemiologist, never have been. I do know a little bit about numbers. I have no idea what's going to happen. So I think if you take those potential factors into play, you can end up in a place to say, \"Hey, we're going to do well, but maybe not as well as we should have.\" We feel really good about where our RPOs are. We really feel good about the demand in our end markets. But at the end of the day, we've got to execute in a world of uncertain labor productivity because of COVID, an uncertain material availability because of supply chain. Mark? Yes. And Mark, we're working with really rational people right now at the owner and GC and CM level. But they also don't control the supply chain issues. The only thing I'll take exception, Sean, when you asked your question, when you said we've comfortably grown EPS double digits, maybe we've been grinding and our folks have worked exceptionally hard to do that. So maybe in a virtual work-from-home environment, it's been comfortable EPS growth. But I can tell you, I couldn't be more proud of how our people have executed to put the kind of results we've had in a very challenging environment over the last 2.5 years. I had to brag on my people here a little bit and the great work... It's actually -- we worry about the same observation, Sean, that people want to secure capacity with really blue-chip contractors right now, which I do think there's been a flight to quality. However, if you go back to that page where I talked about those resilient markets, I think we've grown 9 of the last 12 quarters RPOs, which is not that common for us. This could be lumpy. It comes in and it comes out. One large project can move it one way or another. I do think, though, there's enough significant opportunities out there that we're involved on the front end, and we'll see when they get awarded. It could be a little lumpy. But I feel really good about the opportunities we have in the pipeline that may materialize into significant projects. And we're working as part of a team, right? The project is going to happen, it's just when. And we're 1 of 2 teams that may or may not win it. So the odds are fairly good on some of those projects. Secondarily, I think one of the things I always look at in the business is what's happening in 2 parts of the business to tell you whether momentum may be a little more broad-based. One of the things we look at is our small project work, which is very strong right now. And so it's saying people are not only spending at the top of the market, they're also spending things they need to do to maintain their facilities, gain energy efficiency and get better indoor air quality in their buildings. So we're seeing that. Secondarily, I always watch the fire protection business and the fire protection business, because it's a national business, involved in every sector of construction for us. It remains very strong. Now part of that is our position in the market. But the other part of that is it's sort of a national view on some of the more complex work, and that continues strong. I do think one of the things that's going to continue to drive people maybe to want to make decisions is what I said in my closing. And that is that a lot of these decisions have to be made. People are still well capitalized. And the kind of people we work for, for the most part -- I mean sometimes maybe we thought they were better capitalized than they are, but that's not very often. They need to get this work done. There's a major repositioning going on to support the new investments in the energy transition, but there's also a major repositioning on traditional supply chain that, quite frankly, I haven't -- I only saw my career on the way out, where people were moving from high-cost states to low-cost states and maybe to Mexico and eventually out to Asia. Now you're seeing it in reverse, still going to lower-cost states. And we've really made some pressured investments in there in the mid-2000s and in the last 3 or 4 years, and we sort of got ahead of the curve. So I'll take a shot at a macro level, and then will kick to Mark relatively quickly here. I think that we're very comfortable thinking we can operate within our 3-year averages on all of our segments with the exception of Industrial. There, we expect... To be better. And 3-year averages for us can have 40 to 50 basis points of flux in it, right, Mark? And it's not a quarter-to-quarter business. And like Mark said, some of it has the timing on large projects, when they end, when they start, the contingencies built in and then the acceleration of the small project portfolio. So Mark, I'll throw it to you. Kind of get 4% first. Thanks, Adam. Refining and petrochemical? Okay. Because we have more industrial customers than just EIS. Well, I've covered the other ones a lot, right, in my commentary. Look... Yes. What we're seeing is what we expected for the first quarter, right? We said we're going to continue to sequentially get better. We've said that a number of times. I think we've called it about right. I think they're spending money again. We're clearly in a very good position. I said what I said for a very specific reason in my text. We kept the team together, which is a real credit to the leadership there. It's been a rough 2 years. But we kept the team together. They're executing. I think the year looks pretty good. It looks like a normal year of turnaround activity. Will they run harder and do less turnaround work in the fourth quarter because gas prices are so high? I don't know that. I think they're going to do their maintenance, to be honest with you. I think the other wildcard in that segment is we're not seeing it yet. We're seeing a small return to upstream. We see that in our Electrical business in that segment. I do expect and our people who know a lot more about this because they live it every day. We have experts in this. They expect somewhere around third and fourth quarter to see a resumption of drilling in the Permian and the Eagle Ford and a little bit North Dakota, the Bakken. That will help us. That's the part we don't have baked into anything yet. That would be upside into our business. So I think they're ready to spend money. I think they believe they are long-term winners, the Gulf Coast refining and petrochemical complex. Let's hope for no weather events here in hurricane season, and we should have a pretty good year. Look, I think on the larger workforce protected as it can be. So here's what changed. And this changed for us in the first quarter of last year or maybe even the fourth quarter of '20 because we saw some of this coming. First thing we did is we don't let prices out there for more than -- depending on the kind of job, 7 to 20 days when before we would leave them out there 30 to 60 days. So the amount that we'll honor a quote, especially on a small project work, came in. So we can honor -- and when we do that, we typically are almost brought out on the job, which means we have commitments, especially on the small project work from our suppliers what we're going to pay. As you get to the larger work, there's a couple of different ways you contract it. And you either do it fixed price or you do it GMP, which looks like a fixed-price contract, but it has built-in negotiators for increases in materials and things like that. And more and more contracting has been happening that way on the larger projects because we can't guarantee what the price is going to be. And people are rational, and they know we're about as good as anybody in the business of procuring materials. But just as -- so there's all kind of things like that. And we have all kind of contingencies built in if deliveries don't happen that you wouldn't typically have seen in the past. And people are knowledgeable, and we do a really good job through our central procurement group of keeping lead times in front of people so that they can negotiate with their customers then about what lead times look on critical materials. So long-winded answer to how I feel about what's in backlog, I feel about as good as I could feel. I think we've done everything we can to protect ourselves. I think we priced it correctly. And I think we have as about as good terms as we can get in the environment that we're in. And I think our owners have been fair, and I think our general contractors and construction manager customers have been fair. I mean a lot of these people want us to do the job because we're going to get it done. We're going to get it done right. And we have the technical capability first, the project execution capability. We have the ability to get the labor. And quite frankly, we have the financial strength to do it. People on these large projects actually look to our balance sheet as a point of strength. And it's one of the reasons they contract with us because they know that work is going to get done. We've -- we compete with that. And secondarily, Adam, I think that the biggest wildcard for us this year is things that we don't control, right? I have no idea what's going to happen with COVID, and I'm done projecting that and predicting that. And the supply chain, it's not just pricing in the supply chain, which we can get our head around, availability is more the issue. Someone will make a promise to you. Mark talked about it a little bit. The large project work, we have the chance to sequence things different. We have a chance to lay out the workforce a little different. When you get to the smaller project work or the quick turn work, which may not be a small project where we hit up with a lot of labor, the problem we run into it, if a critical piece of equipment doesn't come in on time, that can really change things out in a retrofit environment. Because a lot of time in a retrofit environment, yes, you're competing on price sometimes, but you're really competing on the least amount of disruption to the facility to keep it operational. And you really go through -- even on a small, you go through very detailed sequencing and planning to do that. You have labor lined up to work over time. You have labor lined up to work weekends. And man, if you miss that by a day or 2, you've -- in for 8 guys, 2 days of labor, you do that over 10 projects, the math becomes sort of ugly pretty quickly. That's the biggest challenge the mechanical service business has had over the past 6 months. And they're as good as anybody in the business of figuring that out. But we have transparency with our distributors. We have this transparency with our equipment suppliers. Their factories and their OEMs disappoint them, too. And so what's causing it in the factories and the OEMs? A lot of times, it's their ability to bring in materials, but a lot of times it's disruption from COVID in their factories and they're not producing to the level they thought they were going to a mere 2 weeks earlier. Yes, absolutely. We continue to build out our fire protection prefabrication capability. We have 4 strategically located facilities now. That will probably be 6 within -- we'll put 2 more in over the next probably 12 months. We continue to enhance our prefabrication in our mechanical and electrical operations. On the mechanical side, we probably have 12 significant shops; on the electrical side, 6. We'll take more square footage, and we'll be doing more things in the shops versus the field. And we'll be doing them on a larger scale to become more modular as we serve these larger projects. Also training, right? It's a soft cost, but it's not for us. We're going to ramp back up our executive training on our company values and our leadership and also our business acumen. We've been on a 2-year hiatus because of COVID. That will start again here in the second week of March and last week of March. We view those as critical to building our culture, which many people consider a softer investment. We do not. We consider it a hard investment. And we think that, more than anything, helped carry us through these last 2 years. We're going to continue to invest in BIM. We've actually put a couple of full-time resources. We put a terrific leader in charge of our BIM initiative. It's actually under one of our key segment leaders, Joe Burns, who runs mechanical, guides that, probably knows more about that than anybody in the industry. We've enhanced our relationship with Autodesk, and we will continue to push the frontier on our scale that we do. We will continue to do more mechanical service training. We're doing some very creative things around mechanical service training and training of our field technicians in general to bring them up. We have some virtual training that we've enhanced. And we also put more money into our applied equipment training center in Arizona, which we expect to ramp back up here in the end of the first quarter. And on the people side, we're investing in project management. So those are all the kinds of things we do, and I'm probably missing a couple of things. Those are the kinds of things we do to build capability that we hope continue to differentiate us in the market. Now look, acquisition is sort of a critical part in that, too. Sometimes we can bring all those tools to the acquisition. Sometimes we learn from the acquisition, right? It works both ways. When we bought B&K down in the Southeast, they were probably a little ahead of it. We thought we were pretty good at prefabrication. They were a little bit ahead of us, especially with some of their shop automation. We took those lessons and took them to other parts of our mechanical business. So acquisitions play a critical role in our ability to not only expand our geographic and technical reach, but also another way to learn. And then one of the big synergies you get is to take our learning, and usually, our acquisitions are hungry to get that learning from us. All right. Look, thank you all. Thanks for listening. And thanks to all the EMCOR folks out there listening. We're going to try to knock it here in the first quarter and hope for another great year. And we're set up to do pretty well. But hey, we'll face headwinds. We always figure out a way to get through them. With that, have a good day."

            "name": "Mark Pompa",
            "content": "Right. Thanks a lot, Tony, and good morning to everyone participating on the call today. For those accessing this presentation via the webcast, we are now on Slide 7. Over the next several slides, I will provide a detailed discussion of our fourth quarter results as well as a summary update of our full year performance, some of which Tony just outlined during his opening commentary. As a reminder, all financial information discussed during this morning's call is included in our consolidated financial statements within both our earnings release announcement and Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier today. So let's discuss EMCOR's fourth quarter performance. Consolidated revenues of $2.64 billion are up $358.7 million or 15.7% from the fourth quarter of 2020. Excluding $63.1 million of incremental revenues attributable to businesses acquired pertaining to the time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in last year's quarter, revenues for the fourth quarter of 2021 increased approximately $296 million or 13% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. We experienced strong revenue growth from all of our reportable segments during the quarter with specific segment performance as follows. United States Electrical Construction segment revenues of $541.9 million increased $80.1 million or 17.3% from quarter 4, 2020. Excluding incremental acquisition revenues of $48.5 million, this segment's revenues grew organically 6.8% quarter-over-quarter. Increased project activity within the commercial and health care market sectors were the primary drivers of the period-over-period improvement. United States Mechanical Construction revenues of $1.06 billion increased $91.2 million or 9.4% from quarter 4, 2020. Revenue growth during the quarter was derived from the majority of the market sectors we serve, with manufacturing and health care project activity representing the most significant period-over-period increases. With respect to the manufacturing market sector and as commented during our third quarter's earnings conference call, we're actively engaged in the construction of certain large food processing plants, which will continue to accelerate as we move through 2022. From a health care perspective, we continue to see strong demand for our services as our customers retrofit or replace their mechanical systems to increase flexibility in their facilities or improve the quality of their work environments. In addition to the increased revenue experienced within these market sectors, this segment additionally benefited from incremental revenue within the water and wastewater market sector, driven by several large construction projects currently underway. Revenue gains of this segment were partially offset by quarterly revenue decline within the institutional market sector due to the completion of several projects in 2020's fourth quarter. Both our Electrical Construction and Mechanical Construction segments established new all-time quarterly revenue record levels with their fourth quarter performance. EMCOR's total domestic Construction fourth quarter revenues of $1.6 billion increased $171.3 million or 12%, with 8.6% of such revenue growth being organic. This combined Construction revenue performance represents the third consecutive quarter where we have eclipsed the previous all-time quarterly revenue record established by this group. Even with this record revenue performance, each of our Construction segments have increased the remaining performance obligations year-over-year, which Tony just commented on and will discuss further when he goes through our RPO development a little later on our call this morning. United States Building Services segment revenues of $630.1 million increased $59.2 million or 10.4%. Excluding incremental acquisition revenues of $14.6 million, this segment's revenues increased 7.8% organically. Revenue gains were reported within most of their operating divisions, with their mobile mechanical and commercial site-based services divisions reporting the largest increases. Greater project and service activities with a focus on building controls and energy efficiency were the primary drivers for the quarterly revenue growth within the mobile mechanical services group, while the growth in commercial site-based services was due to new customer additions as well as the expansion of certain services for existing customers. EMCOR's Industrial Services segment revenues of $283.6 million increased $119.3 million or 72.6% due to improved demand for both field and shop services as we continue to experience some resumption of maintenance and capital spending in the energy sector, which we started to see during the third quarter of 2021. United Kingdom Building Services segment revenues of $123.9 million increased $8.9 million or 7.7% from last year's fourth quarter. Revenue gains resulted from the continuation of strong project demand from this segment's customers, who previously deferred such work during 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the prolonged lockdowns mandated by the U.K. government. Please turn to Slide 8. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $260 million represent 9.8% of fourth quarter revenues and compare to $244.6 million or 10.7% of revenues in the year-ago period. 2021 fourth quarter includes approximately $7.1 million of incremental expenses from businesses acquired, inclusive of intangible asset amortization, resulting in an organic quarter-over-quarter increase in SG&A of $8.3 million. Consistent with my commentary during both our second and third quarter earnings calls, 2020 benefited from substantial cost reductions resulting from our actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant percentage of such savings pertains to employment costs, including furloughs, headcount reductions and temporary salary reductions. Conversely and not to be redundant with my prior quarter's commentary, EMCOR's considerable revenue growth in 2021 has necessitated an increase in headcount. Our SG&A for 2021's fourth quarter additionally reflects an increase in health care costs as a result of a normalization in the level of medical claims as well as the impact of COVID-19-related testing, illnesses and treatments. We have also seen an increase in travel and entertainment expenses due to the continued resumption of normal business activities and have incurred incremental expenses to support various information technology and cybersecurity initiatives. The reduction in SG&A as a percentage of revenues is a result of the aforementioned increase in quarterly revenues without a commensurate increase in certain of our overhead costs as we were able to successfully leverage our cost structure during this period of strong organic growth. Reported operating income for the quarter of $143 million or 5.4% of revenues compares to operating income of $137.6 million or 6% of revenues in 2020's fourth quarter. The 60 basis point reduction in operating margin is due to a reduction in gross profit margin within each of our domestic reportable segments due to a less favorable revenue mix quarter-over-quarter, which I will expand on during my individual segment commentary. Despite this reduction in quarter-over-quarter operating margin, EMCOR's $143 million of operating income represents a new all-time quarterly record. Specific quarterly performance by segment is as follows. Our U.S. Electrical Construction segment operating income of $41.3 million decreased $2.6 million from the comparable 2020 period. Reported operating margin of 7.6% represents a reduction from the 9.5% reported in 2020's fourth quarter. The decrease in both operating income and operating margin is due to declines in gross profit and gross profit margin within the commercial and transportation market sectors, given a change in composition of project work performed quarter-over-quarter. In addition, this segment experienced an increase in quarterly SG&A expenses, the majority of which was a result of incremental expenses resulting from acquisitions, including amortization of identifiable intangible assets. Fourth quarter operating income of our United States Mechanical Construction Services segment of $92.6 million represents a $7.8 million decrease from last year's quarter. And operating margin of 8.7% represents 170 basis point reduction from the strong 10.4% earned in 2020's fourth quarter. Whereas the results for the prior year's quarter benefited from the favorable closeout of several major projects within the commercial and manufacturing market sectors, the results of Q4 2021 included increased revenues from certain large projects within the manufacturing and water and wastewater market sectors for which we are acting as either the general contractor or the construction manager and therefore carry lower-than-average gross profit margins than are typical for this segment. As I stated last quarter, while we saw some operating margin compression on a comparative basis, at a combined 8.4% operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2021, our U.S. Construction operations still generated margins greater than both the 3-year and 5-year averages. Operating income for U.S. Building Services is $27.8 million, which is consistent with the fourth quarter of 2020, while operating margin of 4.4% represents a 50 basis point reduction quarter-over-quarter. This segment's mobile mechanical services division continues to work through a larger number of fixed-price capital projects, which traditionally have a lower gross profit margin profile when compared to the segment's callout service and small project work. Additionally, while we continue to attempt to mitigate the effects of supply chain disruptions by leveraging our relationships with our suppliers and customers and through enhanced labor planning and project scheduling, this segment experienced some productivity impacts resulting from longer material and equipment lead times during the quarter. Our U.S. Industrial Services segment operating income of approximately $4 million represents a $12.6 million improvement from the $8.6 million loss reported in 2020's fourth quarter. Although an improvement, this segment continues to be performing below historical levels of profitability due to the remaining headwinds in the oil and gas industry, which has suppressed maintenance and capital spending and has resulted in continued pricing pressure. However, as stated in my revenue commentary, we have seen some positive movement in each of the last 2 quarters and are cautiously optimistic for 2022 and beyond. U.K. Building Services operating income of approximately $5 million or 4% of revenues represents an increase of $740,000 and a 30 basis point improvement in operating margin quarter-over-quarter. This improvement is due to an increase in project activity primarily within the commercial market sector. We are now on Slide 9. Additional financial items of significance for the quarter not addressed on the previous slides are as follows. Quarter 4 gross profit of $403 million is higher than the comparable prior year quarter by $19.2 million or 5%. However, gross margin of 15.3% is lower than the 16.8% in last year's fourth quarter primarily as a result of the shifts in revenue mix in each of our U.S. Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments as well as our U.S. Building Services segment as I just referenced during my segment operating income discussion. We had no restructuring expenses for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to $1.6 million recorded in 2020's fourth quarter. Diluted earnings per common share of $1.89 represents a new quarterly record for the company and compares to $1.45 per diluted share in last year's fourth quarter. Adjusting 2020's EPS for the negative impact on the prior year's income tax rate resulting from the nondeductible portion of 2020's impairment charges, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2020, was $1.86. When compared to the current quarter, we are reporting a $0.03 or 1.6% quarter-over-quarter earnings per share improving, 1.6%. Please turn to Slide 10. With the fourth quarter commentary complete, I will now augment Tony's introductory remarks on EMCOR's annual performance. Consolidated revenues of $9.9 billion represent an increase of $1.11 billion or 12.6% when compared to 2020. Our year-to-date results include $196.3 million of incremental revenues attributable to businesses acquired pertaining to the period of time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in the 2020 annual period. Acquisitions positively impacted both our United States Electrical Construction and United States Building Services segments. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired, year-to-date revenues increased a strong 10.3% organically, with all of our reportable segments reporting total and organic revenue growth year-over-year. Operating income of $530.8 million represents a substantial increase from both our GAAP and adjusted non-GAAP operating income figures for full year 2020. Year-to-date diluted earnings per share is $7.06 and represents a new full year record as well as an increase of 10.3% over 2020's adjusted non-GAAP diluted EPS of $6.40. Although not shown on this slide, our operating cash flow for 2021 is approximately $319 million. On a comparative basis, 2021's performance is significantly less than the prior year as the contraction in our 2020 revenues due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in declines in accounts receivable and contract assets, which positively affected 2020's operating cash flow. Additionally, as highlighted during the course of 2020, the prior year's operating cash flow was aided by certain government stimulus measures, which resulted in the deferral of approximately $117.5 million of nonincome-based tax payments from 2020 into both 2021 and 2022. With significant organic revenue growth in each of our reportable segments during the 2021 fourth quarter, we experienced an increase in working capital investment, which is typical for a business that is in growth mode. Please turn to Slide 11. EMCOR's balance sheet remains strong and liquid. Cash on hand has decreased by $81.5 million from year-end 2020 or $319 million of operating cash flow was offset by cash used for financing activities of $245.5 million, inclusive of $195.5 million of cash used for the repurchase of our common stock and cash used for investing activities of approximately $153 million, most notably due to payments for 8 acquisitions, net of cash acquired, totaling just over $118 million. Despite the decrease in cash on hand, working capital has increased by nearly $72 million, resulting from organic revenue growth during the period. Increases in accounts receivable and contract assets were partially offset by increases in contract liabilities, accounts payable and accrued expenses. The increase in goodwill is predominantly a result of the businesses we acquired during the 2021 period. Net identifiable intangible assets have increased by $6.5 million during 2021 as the additional intangible assets recognized in connection with the previously referenced acquisitions was largely offset by $64 million of amortization expense during the year. Total debt, exclusive of operating lease liabilities, has decreased by $14.8 million, primarily as a result of the $13.9 million required principal payment made on our term loan in December 2021. EMCOR's debt-to-capitalization ratio has reduced to 10.4% from 11.9% at year-end 2020. Our balance sheet, in conjunction with the borrowing capacity available to us under our credit agreement, will continue to enable us to invest in our business, return capital to shareholders and execute against our strategic objectives as we move into 2022 and periods beyond. With my portion of this morning's slide presentation completed, I will now return the call back to Tony. Tony? Yes, Sean, the only thing I would add to Tony's commentary has to do around mix of revenue. As Tony commented earlier in this morning's call about how we've moved to a more larger project away from traditional commercial work, well, obviously, when you're project planning that larger, more complex work, you have more contingencies built into your estimates. We're on the front end of a lot of that work as we enter 2022. Assuming that the project schedules adhere to what was originally anticipated, we're certainly going to have a lot better feel ultimately for the profitability of those jobs as we progress through the full year calendar. But if the supply chain does continue to rear its ugly head, those project completion time lines might slide into 2023, therefore adding more uncertainty to our estimates. So the work is there. The profitability characteristics have not changed to our detriment. Unfortunately, though, a lot of the uncertainty around the work and how it's going to progress, which is beyond our control, certainly builds in some element of conservatism. To be better. Yes. Noelle, this is grounding, in fact, so to speak. So when you look at full year 2021 by segment, as I mentioned earlier, both Electrical and Mechanical Construction are operating above their 3- and 5-year averages. If you look at the back half of 2021 performance, that trend is not as consistent. So Electrical Construction's last 6 months of 2021 was actually below those averages. My anticipation, and obviously, when we did the financial modeling for purposes of 2022 planning, we're looking at -- and as Tony indicated, we're looking at margin performance consistent with really what it's been in the last 3 years. So that would put Electrical Construction around 8.25%, hopefully slightly higher. Mechanical Construction, that gets you somewhere around 7.75% to 8%. So on a blended rate, when you look at total Construction, it's just either slightly below 8% or up to 8.2%. So that's still a very good performance. When -- I think we all get jaded looking at the last few years and say, okay, that's this reality, the new reality. And as much as I think the EMCOR team would love that to be the situation, we don't control the market. And we're in a sweet spot on some things as Tony covered in depth, but that's not going to continue into perpetuity. But when you look at 2022 from a framework perspective, it doesn't look like we're going to see any softness, so to speak, with regards to demand and opportunities. When you look at our U.S. Building Services, the 2021 performance was slightly below the 3-year or 5-year average for -- once again for the reasons that we've already discussed. Clearly, supply chain difficulties have been the most impactful there. And because there's a fairly significant nonunion labor component to that segment, our ability to shift resources around is good. But if we have labor on-site and materials and equipment are not there for installation, because they're being procured by somebody other than the EMCOR subsidiary, we're still on the hook for payment for that labor, which is not obviously being very productive. So we continue to -- the project management, which is a center of excellence for EMCOR and has been for -- I don't want to say my entire history with the company, but for a long part of my history with the company. So I'd like to think that they're going to somewhere settle around that 5% range. And then as Tony indicated, Industrial, certainly, the last 3 or 4 years have been anything but steady for a lot of exterior reasons that we've discussed ad nauseam in prior calls. But their 3-year average is below 2%. I think we would be very unhappy if that's where the profitability of that segment resulted in 2022. But as we mentioned I believe in last call, as much as I like to be able to shoot back to the mid-single digits, you have to walk before you can run. Yes. So we're certainly trending in that direction. But I think, unfortunately, we've all been collectively disappointed for a lot of different reasons, some through our own fault, most through others' fault. We're not ready to declare victory quite yet in that segment. But we'll obviously have more to talk about as we progress through the year. And the U.K. has been probably the most steady of all of our businesses when you look at variability in margins period-to-period. And they're well above their 3-year average, which is just below 5%. And we'd like to think that 5% or 5.5% range is what our expectations are certainly in the near future. So probably a long answer to a short question. But we're right where we want to be. And once again, assuming project time line, certainly on the larger work progressed as planned, we certainly would think that there's going to be opportunity for improved margin performance relative to how we closed the 2021 period, specifically looking at the back half of the year. But once again, we're going to do everything that we can to control the outcome of those things. But unfortunately, a lot of that is dictated by others and outside influences. Thanks, Adam."

My opening comments will reference pages four through six of our presentation. As we have navigated the last two years, we have learned to operate in highly uncertain and volatile environment. And we have done it with success on almost any metric. We've had to accomplish our mission while keeping our people safe. Our company values of Mission First People always have served us extremely well throughout these unprecedented times. We had an exceptional third quarter at EMCOR, especially against a very difficult comparison in the prior year. As you may recall, in the third quarter of last year, we were bringing about a third of our company back to full operations. We had projects poised and ready to resume or start, delay service that needed to be completed. And buildings, campuses and production facilities that we helped our customers reopen as they resumed operations. Further, we had yet to bring back our full complement of staff that we need to sustain and build our operations. Said simply, we had an abundance of work had all the materials and a lower cost base, as we were still returning to full operations after the extreme cost reductions we had taken in response to the pandemic. Against that backdrop in comparison for the third quarter of 2021, we were able to post $1.85 and earnings per diluted share, versus $1.76 of adjusted diluted earnings per share in the year ago period. We grew revenues to $2.52 billion, with 14.5% overall revenue growth and 12.2% organic revenue growth. We posted 5.4% operating income margins despite strong headwinds from supply chain issues and labor disruptions caused by the Delta Variant. I believe this is very good performance considering the operating conditions we faced in the quarter. We grew remaining performance obligations or RPOs 18.7% from the year ago period to $5.38 billion. We generated operating cash flow of $121 million, despite the strong organic revenue growth. All-in-all, we had a very successful quarter that continues to show the strength and diversity of our business. But more importantly, the outstanding leadership provided by our teams at the subsidiary, segment and corporate level. Our electrical and mechanical construction segments had excellent performance in the third quarter of 2021. Both segments posted strong operating income margins, and had strong organic revenue growth. Through careful planning on our large projects, and excellent supplier relationships we mitigated a lot of the supply chain disruptions facing our operations. However, we have seen cost increases of 10% to 20% and anticipate that such increases will continue in the near future. And that is only part of the issue, as we have seen lead times increased by two to three times their normal levels. Our success in the quarter points to the continued resiliency of our teams, the ability to navigate these issues, deliver for our customers and continue to keep our workforce productive and safe. We continue to have a robot pipeline of data center, warehousing and healthcare projects. And we had strong bookings with our manufacturing clients in the quarter. Building Services had the most difficult comparison a quarter as a deep cost cuts taken at the height of the shutdown were most severe in the segment. We still post a decent operating income marked as a 5% against the year ago period of 6.9%. However, we were most affected in this segment by supply chain issues and diminished productivity. Although demand for our retrofit project work is very strong, we had some issues with a synchronization of our supply chain with our labor planning, resulting in reduced productivity. To mitigate these issues, it has become a common practice that daily communications on deliveries and price changes on our quick term project and service work. Further, this segment also bears the brunt of the dollar per gallon increase in the fuel, which gasoline and diesel year-over-year due to its large fleet and this had an impact of 20 to 30 basis points on operating income margins. We can pass some of this increase on our customers that had just repriced into our time and material rates in June. We will do so again between now and January across the majority of our building services operations. This is the second increase this year, which is not our usual practice of executing which is once a year, usually in June. Demand remained strong and we will continue to improve our planning over the next quarter or two. Industrial Services continue to operate as we expected. We improved on a year-over-year basis with respect to revenue and operating income. We had some impact with respect to the storms in the Gulf Coast. But that mainly just pushed out work to later in the year or into next year. And we did have some disruption to our shop work in Louisiana. Demand for our services continues to build. Refinery utilization is at a very high level. And we expect to and we expect to execute a better fourth quarter turnaround season this year versus the year ago period. We also anticipate much improved demand as we exit the year and move into the first quarter of 2022. The U.K. continues to execute well for its customers with double digit revenue growth and good operating income margins. Demand remained strong for our services. But like in the United States, we are also battling supply chain issues for our quick term project work in the United Kingdom. We'll leave the quarter with a pristine balance sheet, strong fundamentals and record RPOs. And with that Mark, I\u2019ll turn it over to you.\nMark Pompa: Thank you, Tony, and good morning to everyone participating on today's call. For those accessing this presentation via the webcast, we are now on slide seven. Over the next several slides I will augment Tony's opening commentary on EMCOR\u2019s third quarter, as well as provide a brief update on our year-to-date results through September 30. All financial information referenced this morning is derived from our consolidated financial statements included in both our earnings release announcement and Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier today. So let's revisit and expand overview of EMCOR\u2019s third quarter performance. Consolidated revenues of $2.52 billion are up $320 million or 14.5% over Quarter 3, 2020 and represent a new all-time quarterly revenue record for EMCOR. Each of our reportable segments experienced quarter-over-quarter revenue growth. Excluding $50.3 million of revenues attributable to businesses acquired, pertaining to the time that such businesses are not owned by EMCOR and last year's quarter, revenues for the third quarter of 2021 increased nearly $270 million or a strong 12.2% when compared to the third quarter of 2020, which was still somewhat impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The specifics of each reportable segment are as follows: United States Electrical Construction revenues of $527.9 million increased $55.9 million or 11.8% from 2020s third quarter. Excluding acquisition revenues within the segment of $29.5 million this segment's revenues grew organically 5.6% quarter-over-quarter. Increased project activity within the commercial healthcare and institutional market sectors were the primary drivers of the period over period improvement. United States mechanical construction segment revenues of $999.6 million increased $108.1 million or 12.1% from Quarter 3, 2020. The results of this segment represent a new quarterly revenue record. Revenue growth during the quarter was driven by increases within the manufacturing, healthcare and commercial market sectors. With respect to the manufacturing market sector, we are in the early phases of construction on several food processing plants, which will accelerate further as we move into 2022. From a healthcare market sector perspective, there continues to be greater demand for our services, as we are engaged in a number of projects ranging from mechanical system retrofits to complete installations in both new and existing healthcare facilities. Lastly, within the commercial market sector, we continue to see strong demand for data center project work given growth in digital storage and cloud computing across the United States. And we continue to assist our e-commerce customers with the build out of the warehouse and distribution network through both traditional mechanical as well as fire protection services. Third quarter revenues from EMCOR\u2019s combined United States construction business of $1.53 billion increased $164 million or 12%, with 9.9% of such revenue growth being organic. This combined revenue performance eclipses the quarterly revenue record established by this group during the second quarter of this year. Despite this record revenue performance, each of our construction segments have increased the remaining performance obligations both year-over-year as well as sequentially. United States Building Services Quarterly revenues of $632.5 million increased $75.9 million or 13.6%. Excluding acquisition revenues of $20.8 million the segment's revenues increased at 9.9% organically. Revenue gains were reported within our mobile mechanical services division due to increase project, service repair and maintenance activities. Our commercial site based services division as a result of new contract awards, and our government services division given an increase in indefinite delivery indefinite quantity project volumes. EMCOR\u2019s industrial services segment revenues of $232.2 million increased $60.7 million or 35.4% due to improve demand for both field and shop services, as we are beginning to see some resumption of maintenance and small capital spending in the energy sector. United Kingdom Building Services revenues of $129.5 million increased $19.4 million or 17.6% from last year's quarter. Revenue gains for the quarter resulted from the continuation of strong project demand from the segment's maintenance customers who previously deferred such work during 2020 as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic in the related prolonged U.K. government lockdown measures. Additionally, the segment's revenues were positively impacted by $8 million, a favorable foreign exchange rate movements within the quarter. Please turn to slide eight. Selling, General, Administrative expenses of $243.9 million represent 9.7% of third quarter revenues and compared to $226.8 million or 10.3% of revenues in the year ago period. The current year's quarter includes approximately $5.3 million of incremental expenses from businesses acquired, inclusive of intangible asset amortization, resulting in an organic quarter-over-quarter increase in SG&A of $11.9 million. Consistent with my commentary during our second quarter earnings call, the prior year period benefited from substantial cost reductions resulting from our actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant percentage of such savings pertained to employment costs, including furloughs, headcount, reductions, and temporary salary reductions. Conversely, EMCOR\u2019s considerable revenue growth in 2021 has necessitated an increase in headcount in the current year. Additionally, our SG&A for the current period reflects an increase in health care costs, as the result of a normalization in the level of medical claims, as well as greater travel and entertainment expense due to a partial resumption of certain business activities by our workforce, when compared to the same timeframe in 2020. The reduction in SG&A as a percentage of revenues as a result of the aforementioned increase in quarterly revenues without a commensurate increase in certain of our overhead costs, as we were able to successfully leverage our cost structure during this period of strong organic revenue growth. Reported operating income for the quarter of $137.4 million or 5.4% of revenues, compares to operating income of $135.9 million or 6.2% of revenues in 2020\u2019s third quarter. The 80 basis point reduction in operating margin loss due to reductions in gross profit margin within several reportable segments due to a less favorable revenue mix, which I will elaborate on during my individual segment commentary. Despite this reduction in quarter-over-quarter operating margin, EMCOR\u2019s $137.4 million of operating income represent a new third quarter record. Specific quarterly performance by segment is as follows: Our U.S. Electrical Construction segment operating income of $44.1 million decreased $1.9 million from the comparable 2020 period. Reported operating margin of 8.3% represents a reduction from the 9.7% margin reported in 2020\u2019s third quarter. The decrease in both operating income and operating margin is due to a decline in gross profit within the commercial and transportation market sectors given a change in the composition of project work performed quarter-over-quarter. In addition, and as disclosed in last year's third quarter, the results from the prior year period benefited from the settlement of final contract value on two projects, which favorably impacted this segments Q3, 2020 operating income and operating margin by $4.4 million and 70 basis points respectfully. Third quarter operating income for U.S. Mechanical Construction Services segment of $82.3 million represents a $2.3 million increase from last year's quarter, while operating margin of 8.2% represents an 80 basis point reduction from the 9% earned in 2020\u2019s 3rd quarter. From an operating margin perspective similar to our Electrical Construction segment the reduced profitability can be attributed to a less favorable mix of work during the quarter. Most notably, this segment experienced a decrease in gross profit margin within the manufacturing market sector, as the results for the period include increased revenues from certain large food processing projects, for which we are for which we are acting as the construction manager and carry lower than average gross profit margins when compared to our traditional subcontractor arrangements with our customers. Further, the results for the year ago period benefited from the favorable close out of several manufacturing projects, which resulted in incremental operating margin contribution. To be clear, the impacts within the quarter for both our Construction Segments relate to discrete projects or events. It should not be misconstrued as representative of a margin expectations for our on-going projects and service contracts included in remaining performance obligations, which Tony will cover in detail later this morning. Our combined U.S. Construction business is reporting $126.4 million of operating income with an 8.3% operating margin. This level of operating income represents a new third quarter record for our combined construction business. I would like to add that though below that of the prior year, the operating margins today in 2021 for each of our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments exceed both their three year and five year average margins. Operating income for U.S. building services is $31.6 million or 5% of revenues. This represents a reduction of $6.9 million and 190 basis points of operating margin quarter-over-quarter. Growth and operating income within the segment's commercial site based and government services divisions was not enough to offset the clients within its mobile, mechanical and energy services divisions. As I commented during last quarter\u2019s call, our Mobile Mechanical Services Division has a large number of fixed price capital projects currently in process, which traditionally have a lower gross profit margin profile than the segments call out service and small project work. In addition, during the quarter, we experienced some productivity issues partially due to the delayed receipt of certain equipment and materials, which has impacted our profitability both in terms of dollars and margin. Lastly, growth in the segment's SG&A expenses due to headcount additions to support revenue growth, as well as incremental amortization expense related to businesses acquired further compressed operating income and operating margin. Our U.S. Industrial Services segment operating loss of $3 million represents a $5.9 million improvement from the $8.9 million loss reported in 2020\u2019s 3rd quarter. Development improvement, this segment continues to be impacted by difficult market conditions within the oil and gas industry. Additionally, though, not as severe as in the prior year quarter, this segment experienced lost workdays due to both temporary plant and certain customer site closures, resulting from named storm activity in the Gulf Coast region during the 2021 quarter. U.K. Building Services operating income of $6.6 million or 5.1% of revenues represents an increase of $1.3 million and a 30 basis point improvement and operating margin quarter-over-quarter. Approximately $400,000 of this period-over-period improvement is due to positive foreign exchange movement, with the remainder attributable to an increase in project activity primarily within the commercial market sector. We are now on slide nine. Additional financial items of significance for the quarter not addressed in the previous slides are as follows: Quarter three gross profit of $381.3 million is higher than the comparable quarter by $18.2 million or 5%, gross margin of 15.1% as lower than the 16.5% and last year's third quarter due to the shift in revenue mix in each of our U.S. Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments as well as their U.S. building services segment as I just referenced during my segment operating income discussion. Diluted earnings per common share of $1.85 represents a new quarterly record for the company and compares to $1.11 per diluted share in last year\u2019s third quarter. Adjusting 2020\u2019s EPS for the negative impact and our prior year income tax rate resulting from the non-deductible portion of last year's non-cash impairment charges recorded during 2020 second quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 was $1.76 when compared to our current quarter\u2019s performance, we are reporting a $0.09 or 5.1% quarter-over-quarter earnings per share improvement. Please turn to slide 10. With my quarter commentary complete, I will touch on some high level highlights with respect to EMCOR\u2019s results for the first nine months of 2021. Revenues of $7.26 billion represent an increase of $747.8 million, or 11.5%, of which 9.4% of such revenue growth was generated by organic activities. Operating income of $387.8 million or 5.3% of revenues represents a significant increase from reported operating income for the first nine months of 2020 and a double digit increase from the corresponding adjusted non-GAAP operating income figure for that period. Year-to-date diluted earnings per share is $5.17 and represents an increase of approximately 14% over 2020\u2019s adjusted non-GAAP EPS for the nine month period. Although not shown on the slide, my last comment on our year-to-date results is with respect to operating cash flow. For the first nine months of 2021, we have generated approximately $114 million of operating cash flow, which is well below 2020s record performance. As I commented last quarter, our substantial organic revenue growth has required increased working capital investment. This contrast to 2020 where for a large part of the year, we were liquidating our balance sheet due to the revenue declines resulting for the from the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, it is important to note that last year\u2019s nine month operating cash flow was favorably impacted by $82.3 million due to government stimulus measures that allow for the deferral of certain tax payments in both the United States and the United Kingdom. As previously communicated, my expectation for full year 2021 was operating cash flow in excess of $300 million. With our upward revision in 2021 revenue expectations, I am still targeting the same level of operating cash flow performance, but it is possible that we may not eclipse the $300 million target should our working capital investment be greater than expected during the fourth quarter. Please turn to slide 11. EMCOR\u2019s balance sheet remains strong and liquid. Cash on hand is down from year-end 2020 driven by cash used in financing activities are approximately $213 million, inclusive of $183 million used for the repurchase of our common stock and cash used in investing activities of $137.5 million, most notably due to payments for acquisitions that have cash acquired totaling approximately $114 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by cash provided by operations of $114 million as I noted just a few moments ago. Working capital has increased by nearly $20 million. Increases in accounts receivable on contract assets resulting from our substantial organic revenue growth during the period were partially offset by the decrease in our cash balance just referenced as well as our increase in contract liabilities. The increase in goodwill is predominantly a result of the five businesses acquired during the first nine months of this year. Net identifiable intangible assets increased by $19 million as the impact of additional intangible assets recognize the connection with the previously referenced acquisitions which was largely offset by $48 million of amortization expense during the year-to-date period. As a reference point, on a full year basis we anticipate depreciation and amortization expense, including both depreciation of property, plant and equipment, as well as amortization of intangible assets to be approximately $112 million for 2021. Total debt exclusive of operating lease liabilities is fairly consistent with that of December 2020. And EMCOR\u2019s debt-to-capitalization ratio has reduced to 11.4% from 11.9% at year-end, 2020. EMCOR remains well positioned to capitalize on available opportunities as our balance sheet, combined with the borrowing capacity available to us under our credit agreement provides us with great flexibility and pursuing numerous organic and strategic investments. With my portion of this morning slide presentation completed. I would like to give a call back to Tony, Tony?\nTony Guzzi: Thanks Mark. And I'm going to be on page 12 remaining performance obligations by segment and market sector. We had another strong project bookings quarter here at EMCOR. Each of our five reporting segments are RPO growth year-over-year, while as we mentioned earlier, simultaneously increasing revenue over the same period. We also saw RPO growth in seven of the eight market sectors in which we report. By definition, RPO and project bookings are forward-looking. So it's fair to say that we're currently seeing strong future demand across all of our segments and market sectors. While September 30, is a single point in time, and project certainly ebb and flow, we are well positioned moving into 2022. As mentioned earlier, total company RPOs at the end of the third quarter were just under $5.4 billion, up $849 million or 18.7% when compared to the year ago level of $4.5 billion. Organic RPO growth was strong 15.6%. Year-to-date for the nine months completed in 2021 total RPOs have increased $784 million, or just over 17%. The strong booking activity across the company trends related to a book-to-bill ratio well over one, despite the company generating record revenues. Our two domestic construction segments experienced strong construction project growth in the quarter, with RPOs increasing $606 million or 16.5% from the same period last year. RPOs were lifted slightly by two Midwestern Electrical Construction Services acquisitions completed this year. Building Services or RPO levels increased 180 million or almost 29% from the year ago quarter, 142 million and 180 million was organic. We continue to see widespread small and short duration project demand and believe this will remain active through the end of the year and into 2022 as workers returned to buildings, campuses, factories and institutional facilities across the country post COVID and as the Delta variant hopefully continues to subside. Our Industrial Services segments, our RPO increase of $53 million from September 2020. Work within our heat exchanger shops has been building and while still are lower than historical levels, pricing appears to be improving a bit. Further, we continue to build capability, execute fixed price contract work, in both our electrical and mechanical trades in this segment. While this segment remains challenged due to macroeconomic forces, we are starting to see signs of increased activity, much as we expected as we move into 2022 and that is good news. In summary, we continue to see strong momentum in our core markets and our scale, diversity of demand, and ability to pivot to more resilient sectors has allowed us to continue to have strong bookings in RPO growth, but also very strong organic revenue growth. I'm now going to finish our discussion on pages 15 and 16. We are closing in on yet another record year performance at EMCOR despite a very difficult operating environment. At the beginning of the year, we expected that margins would be under some pressure. But we believe that we would have the necessary revenue growth to offset any margin compression. We foresaw the supply chain issues, but quite frankly, they are worse than we expected. We not only have seen increasing and volatile pricing, but lead times that extend through two to three times normal levels. Energy prices, especially gasoline and diesel costs have increased by more than we anticipated. We also expect COVID to be much less impactful than it was as a Delta variant caused disruption on some job sites and send some key supervision into quarantine. Working in this challenging environment, we continue to deliver in a no excuses manner and execute well for our customers while keeping our employees safe. Despite such headwinds, we are raising our guidance. Our new guidance is diluted earnings per share of $6.95 to $7.15 and we now expect our revenues between $9.80 billion and $9.85 billion. As we close on 2021, we do expect to continue to be challenged by supply chain and productivity issues. But we will work through them as we are resilient. We expect the non-residential market to show mid-single digit growth in 2021 and expect that momentum to continue into 2022. We, like all large employers will have to navigate complying with the pending emergency temporary standard or ETS with respect to mandatory vaccination and testing and the executive order mandating vaccination on federal contracts. The ETS has not been released and therefore the related costs to comply and the impact to our productivity are unknown. We expect to energy generate additional operating cash flow in the fourth quarter. And we expect to continue to be balanced capital allocators. To date into 2021, we have repurchased $183 million in EMCOR stock, paid $21 million in dividends and invested $114 million in acquisitions that will continue to position EMCOR for long term and sustained growth. Our board of directors just authorized a new and our largest share repurchase authorization of an additional $300 million. We continue to have a very active acquisition pipeline. I am thankful for EMCOR team members and leaders for their dedication and resilience as we continue to focus on employee safety, and delivering for our customers. As always, thank you for listening and you interest in EMCOR. And with that, Jerome, I will now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Market. Your line is open.\nTony Guzzi: Hi, Sean.\nSean Eastman: Great. Morning. Great quarter. Thank you. So everyone is obviously worried about labor availability supply chain, inflation, you guys touched on it quite a bit in the prepared remarks. But maybe just in short, Tony, what's the playbook for running the business in this sort of resource constrained operating environment? I mean, what are kind of the one, two, three things you're doing or really focused on, as we look out the next couple of quarters.\nTony Guzzi: Sean, it really comes down to a couple things. The labor availability, I'm going to put to the side for a minute. I think our folks over a very long period of time have figured out how to navigate through labor availability. And now we have learned how to navigate through disruptions to labor, with the pandemic, on our job sites. So I think we know how to do that. I think we'll get through that. And we've done it before in high growth markets. We're blessed with some of the best local management that you can have that really understands their labor, and understands how to keep good supervision on job sites. Going to the second point on supply chain. I think now's the time in some ways you get rewarded for being a good partner. EMCOR has never been known as a company that takes advantage of its suppliers on terms or doesn't do what we say we're going to do. We also don't blame suppliers for things that were our problems, which could be common practice in our industry at times. So we're known as a pretty good partner for a supplier. And that's paying dividends. Now, where you see that most is at the distribution level. Most of what we buy comes through distribution in some form or another. And we have very good OEM relationships. And because of our scale, we have the ability to make sure on our most important jobs, that we can keep availability, as good or better than anybody else. The thing that might be a little bit different in this playbook right now is how you deal with the short term quick term service work. One of the things we pride ourselves on is keeping our customers facilities, factories, educational facilities, institutions, healthcare facilities up and running. When someone makes a commitment to us on a six week project, that the materials are going to be there, we believe them. And in today's world, I think that's become more problematic, not because our suppliers don't think they can deliver it in that time period, is that sometimes they can't. So we've had to go the extra mile and communications. And it really has changed some of our planning. Before we something as similar as demo something, we mean by that is demolish something, so that we can build because we have to keep our customers facilities running. And it couldn't be as simple as we were getting really good at on time, right on right on place, delivery of service parts. I think some of that's going to go by the wayside for the next six to nine months, as we just like to make sure we have it in our hands before we start a repair. So a lot of variables going on. It's 1000 details. So the first one is labor availability, a lot of communication. The second way is a supply chain, having been a good partner or being rewarded for that now. Lots of communications, don't get to advance in the project until you're sure that you have the materials you need to execute to the next part of the project. And then the third one is be very clear on contract terms. I'm actually pleased with how we've been able to work with our customers through these supply chain issues and through the pandemic. Everybody seems to have the attitude right now that we're all in this to some extent together. And we're just trying to get to completion and get and get a building built, get a data center built, get it commissioned in online and a lot of planning has to go on is less than ideal. Unfortunately, things like this teach you new lessons that in some ways will make you better long term. But I would just leave you with this. The supply chain issues are unprecedented. I'm seeing lead times I've never seen in my career, and I've been doing this a long time. That is almost as big of an issue for us as pricing or is a bigger issue. Mark, any add up?\nMark Pompa: No, Tony. I think Sean what, it's unprecedented, at least in my professional career. And not to overplay this. But I think, the fact that we have long standing relationships within our supply chain certainly advantageous to us. But ultimately, there's a lot of things that have to happen on the front end, in order for us to continue to be successful. And we all contingency plan to the best that we can. But ultimately, there's only so much we could do. And I think we've been successful today. And based on our revision and earnings guidance, we don't see any reason why we will not continue to have the same level of success as we move forward through the end of 2021.\nSean Eastman: Okay, great. All right, that's helpful. And then and then maybe just trying to connect the dots between Tony, your last comment there just on unprecedented supply chain, lead times, and not getting too advanced on a project until you're sure you have the materials, sort of balancing that with this, huge momentum in RPOs. And, and in, in the bookings trends year-to-date. I mean, the RPO's are up mid-teens organically, clearly, that support some nice growth into next year. But do we need to kind of moderate our expectations around kind of how much you're going to let the business grow in this kind of environment. I mean, if you can, sort of level set on a reasonable expectation for growth into next year, even qualitatively around these dynamics, that would be that would be helpful.\nTony Guzzi: Yes, look Sean, we've always had the belief that we typically in a good market grow little grow better than what the non-res markets going to grow. We are in some resilient sectors. And so we're not going to hold back when we can win good work, and we can responsibly execute that work. And so if you look at our RPO\u2019s we believe that that's representative of what we think we can accomplish at those elevated levels. I think what happens in this kind of environment, and we've seen this over the last two or three years, is there's a definite especially at the two ends, right? Owners, when you're doing a service project or retrofit project, want to go with quality people that know how to do the work and can plan and you think about it, there would even be more reason to want to deal with a company like ours, because they know that we have the resources to make that happen. And on the top end, at the project level, you're competing against a budget a lot of times now, but people want to be with well resource companies. And that's beyond just financial strength. That's what the resources to actually do the planning to learn from each other, to be able to draw on the kind of supplier relationships Mark and I talked about, and to have very clear communications on what we can accomplish and on what schedule. So I don't think there's a fixed amount which say this company can grow. It's very much a bunch of individual decisions and local markets and sectors. And I think the appetite for larger projects is out there with some of our owners. I tell you what you do see in this kind of environment, I think what we're benefiting. From some of our construction manager, general contractor customers in a market that may have less complication, sometimes would like to cut up a job, right and give different pieces to different people. In this kind of environment you'd rather be with somebody like us and let us worry about multiple parts of the project and multiple trades on that project. And what I mean by that is not necessarily or mixing or electrical mechanical work, but we can take a greater mechanical scope or greater electrical scope on a project and so we are seeing that. And that might be what part of what's underlying that RPO growth.\nSean Eastman: Very interesting. Alright, I'll turn it over. Thanks, guys.\nTony Guzzi: Thanks, Sean.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Your line is open.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey, good morning, guys. Congrats on a great quarter.\nTony Guzzi: Thanks, Adam.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey, Tony, what would be your thought on margins in backlog?\nTony Guzzi: Adam, I don't have any reason to believe that we didn't we don't we haven't booked work at an acceptable margin. Now, margins fluctuate quarter to quarter as Mark talked about. We're still well above even in the quarter, three year average. If you've been following us a long time. I think you would agree for the most part. These are very good margin levels especially with the headwind that we're seeing in industrial with no real operating income margin contribution. Some of that has to do with contract structure, as you get to the bigger jobs, right, you might be working on more GMP or guaranteed maximum price type contracts that adjust. And there's more cost transparency, some of it will have to do with the quick turn service work in the margin there. So we don't ever sit there and say, hey, there's a specific margin of backlog we're looking for, quite frankly, it's a tough thing to measure. But we do look for say, do we have the right work? The right people, and the right tool is to earn an acceptable return on capital employed, and return on investment and return on labor for that project work. So we feel good about what we have in RPO\u2019s. We think it's good to mix it we've had, but again, that will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. Mark?\nMark Pompa: Yes. Adam, really nothing to add to that. I think, when you look at our year-to-date, margin performance, it is quite strong. Clearly, because of the complexity of this business, you do get some margin fluctuations, quarter-to-quarter depending on the timing of work. We are, we are on the front end of a lot of large work right now. And, as our history has indicated, we tend to, we tend to be a little bit more cautious with profit recognition at that point until we're fully established on the job site. And clearly with, the everything that was required as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic we're being extra cautious with regards to our labor on site, and obviously, how we're working with the other trades around us. So, we certainly did not tell our operating teams to reduce their level of expectation for profitability and work as they're approaching their markets. We're clearly requiring the same level of excellent execution amongst all of our projects and service opportunities, so that so that it hasn't changed. So I don't see that our future is going to look any different than our than our recent past. And we're going to continue to perform well, for all of our stakeholders.\nTony Guzzi: Yes, let me let me tie together a couple thoughts there for the broader group. And Adam, you gave us a good opening to do that on page 13, and 14. So we talked about what we had in these resilient sectors in these growth opportunities. And so when you look at page 13 and you see data centers, warehouses, industrial manufacturing, healthcare, water and wastewater, mechanical services, in their quality of fire protection. Everything we've talked about for the last year and a half is still very strong. And some of them really stand out. I mean, fire protection continues to be a very strong market for us. We are the nationwide leader, especially in the installation side. And we got to be two or three on the service side now. This digital buildup, data centers and the digital infrastructure around supply chain that's happening within the country, maybe they should let some of those guys take over the ports and figure out how to get that done. But what we're doing within the country is pretty strong. Well the data center market continues very strong as the infrastructure for the supply chain for the big delivery services. Industrial manufacturing continues to be two, I think three stories for us. The first story is we're really good at tech manufacturing and supporting tech manufacturing. And you think what's going to happen with a chip build out, we're well positioned in a couple markets where that's going to take place. You think what's happening in food processing, which is going to continue to grow. We're very well positioned with our Shambaugh subsidiary. They have some nice opportunity in front of them, they tend to be episodic. But that team knows really knows how to execute, as does our tech manufacturing people. And finally, the reshoring of manufacturing is a real trend. And the supply chain issues continue to exacerbate that. We've been talking about it for two or three years. We continue to see that and you really see it and things like the things on a pharma, grid resiliency, and finally on building products, you see it in all three of those areas. Healthcare continues to be a good market for us. And it's going to continue to be. One thing we learned in the pandemic. And I think our healthcare customers obviously are dead serious people. And as a result of that, they're looking to build more resiliency and more flexibility into their facilities. And they realize their mechanical systems especially may need to be updated and made more flexible. Water wastewater for us as a more localized market on the mechanical side, much more natural on the electrical side certainly not as big as scope, mechanical services, indoor air quality and energy retrofit are all very strong markets for us. What you're seeing a little bit in the building services margin is not so much that the work wasn't good at RPO is what you're seeing in some ways is, is that's where the supply chain issues came to a head the fastest. That team knows how to execute, they've been correcting it, maybe we had a couple 25% of the problem was ours, but 75% was probably externally gender driven. And across all those sectors, the fire protection business remains very strong. I would add one more, and that's respect to energy transition. I mean, clearly, as a big trade contractor, we have something that's very valuable for people to use. We will participate in the energy transition, and already are. We have a solar capability. We've done some projects, both in our electrical segment. And we've now started to really build a capability in our industrial services segment to do that work. That work has long lead time, though. I mean, and will participate there. We also do a solar work and conducting with our mechanical services work, especially in states like California, New Jersey, and in New York, and some in Arizona. So we do that work today. And it's more, low megawatt megawatt or less provider, versus the 200 megawatt sites that our electrical segment may do, or our electrical work, trades in the industrial services. And then finally, as you start thinking about things longer term like carbon capture this pipe, and there'll be a lot of piping done around that. And that will happen both in our mechanical construction segment, and our industrial services segment. And we're in the best on some of those ideas. In the first or second ending, we're seeing our customers already start to talk to us about us and the capability we'll have there. And in the thing you don't think as much about and something we are participating in on the industrial services segment. And again, it's in the first inning is the renewable fuels that some of our refinery customers are actually adapting their facility to do and again, it's electrical system upgrades, and as pipe, both of which we're pretty good at. So put all that together. We feel good about some of these growing markets. Now go to page 14, we have some headwinds, right. I mean, everybody's wrestling with the same thing right now on supply chain. And you're going to worse, what did we expect it to be in here, when we make guidance that as the year progressed, if you remember, we were doing a little bit of whining about supply chain. In our first quarter call, in our second quarter call, we did a little more whining. And here in the third quarter call, we're talking about it more. So we expected good availability, but some price increase, material prices are volatile, and increasing. But that second point, we make on that chat on the lead times. So market will probably see right, if the projects are going to go, they'll move forward, they may slide to the right, you see some of that already in our numbers. And so what that really affects for us is our ability to recognize revenue or profit at a certain time, because versus what we plan. And sometimes we may have a gap, right. We may have labor that we need to keep on board because the schedule has been elongate a little bit. We're pretty good about not doing that. But that could be one of the productivity issues that we wrestle with. So you know, Adam, you gave us a chance to talk more comprehensively about it. But I hope that answers a lot of folks questions about how all this knits together.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay, great color. I'll turn it over.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Zane Karimi with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nZane Karimi: Hey, good morning, Tony, Mark, Kevin, and congratulations on the solid quarter.\nTony Guzzi: Good morning, Zane.\nZane Karimi: So I know you guys alluded to it earlier, but can you provide some more color around any of the impacts of industrial segments or related to the storms in the South?\nTony Guzzi: Mark, I want to turn that to you.\nMark Pompa: Yes, Zane. I mean, clearly, the storm activity in the current year, third quarter was not as exaggerated as it was a year ago. But clearly Ida and to a lesser extent, Tropical Storm Nicholas were impactful, most impactful to our customers who basically they had a closer facility as a result of that, which ended up deferring some of the work that we were anticipating and doing in the third quarter. So that work, for the most part is has trickled into quarter four. However, some of that looks like it actually might trickle into the first quarter of 2022. So certainly impactful. But last year's quarter was much more impacted by the rest. I believe there was five named storms in the third quarter of 20, calendar 2020. Most of which did impact us our customers in some way, shape or form. So we, we did have lost workdays this quarter, but still, we're all happy with the performance of that segment, certainly on a comparative basis to a year ago and how that market is developing for us as we move forward in the year.\nTony Guzzi: Yes Mark, I think one of the things we see, in general with industrial services Zane is, we've communicated correctly, here at this level, about what how we thought the year was going to roll out and how things would strengthen and where the opportunities would be. We can only do that, because that tells you how intuitive our folks are with their customers, and what kind of position we have with our customers to be able to actually get a pretty good handle on how the markets evolving. I don't think that's necessarily that common with some of our competitors. But it shows you the depth of our customer relationships, but also the sort of market awareness that our team has. The other thing is, when you get to that, the impact of storms, we can't control what happens within our customers. But we've started to do a much better job of in our case, is we've done more and more things to harden our facilities to be able to withstand the storms, much better than over the last 18 months than we had previously. And we're going to continue to do that.\nZane Karimi: Great, thank you. And then one more. Yes, you did mention, solar. Some of that's interesting. But can you talk a little bit about the M&A environment that you're seeing now? And how you're feeling about that going into 2022?\nTony Guzzi: Yes, so I've been a consistent whiner over probably 10 years, complaining about the prices private equity will pay and the things they will do and deal structure. You know what, somehow we've managed to do a bunch of very successful deals with the right people at the right time. And I think our acquisition program over the last five years, has been as well executed as well integrated as almost any time in our history. I think it has been the best time in our history for M&A. All that being said, we've made some progress, right. We've done $114 million here today. I think the way we've described it, we expect to be able to at least replicate what we've done from 2017 through 2024. Deals happen when they happen. We have a lot of discussions going on. It's a pretty active market for every one deal that may even get to the point where I look at, we've looked at 10. Our business development team, and they're really good at working with our segment people to get that down to something we can look at. We've done some creative things around the companies we've just bought, we bought our first ESOP and we did extraordinarily well. And we're very happy with the incorporation of that very fine electrical contractor in the Midwest into our family. That was something we hadn't done before. And but we figured out how to do that. And when that opportunity presents itself, we will be a buyer that tends, we think that could be a good market for us. We aren't competitive when it's a broad auction with 15 private equity people thrown in numbers bidding the book. So, I'd say more of the same. We continue to see opportunities, and we love where our balance sheet is to be able to do those deals. We can always look at somebody and say, we can close. And we can close without condition on financing. And add one other thing, I\u2019m proud of speaking. We continue to attract folks that are selling their life's work, or their families, generational life's work. And we're good home for those companies. And I was in a discussion several weeks, a week ago with someone. And you could see the pride of that person of what they build as a team. And hopefully, we'll be able to make that deal here at EMCOR. And we're out there doing that all the time. So all that being said, and okay, environment. I'll add one other thing when you go to the balance sheet. We take for granted, the success we've had with our balance sheet. That balance sheet is a point of competitive differentiation for us. I believe and I think Mark believes and our segment leadership believes that having that liquidity on our balance sheet is something these bigger customers look to, because they know we're going to complete the job. They know we're going to have the working capital to get it done. And they know that we're not going to it's sort of endemic of how we think about the business overall. We take measured risk, and that's how they want us to do if they're trusting us to do an $80 million project that's going to burn in 13 months in his critical data infrastructure. So you can't separate the two. And it's not only a point to allow us to firepower for acquisitions, but some of this good great underlying organic growth you see it because customers trust us to be measured conservative and thoughtful, and how we approach the overall business.\nZane Karimi: Great. Well thank you for all that. And I'll jump back into the queue.\nTony Guzzi: Thank you\nOperator: All right. Thank you no further question at this time, so I'll turn the call back to Tony Guzzi for any closing remarks.\nTony Guzzi: Yes, thanks to you all. It's certainly been an interesting year. And I want to then just finish by thanking our EMCOR employees, our subsidiary teams, you've done a great job, our segment teams. I know the four of us sitting around this table today feel blessed to be able to be on the same team as you all. Stay safe. And I'm not going to wish you a happy Halloween because it's probably the holiday I care at least about, but we won't see until after the holiday. So Happy Thanksgiving, and happy holiday season. Thanks. Bye.\nOperator: Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Mark Pompa",
            "content": "Thank you, Tony, and good morning to everyone participating on today's call. For those accessing this presentation via the webcast, we are now on slide seven. Over the next several slides I will augment Tony's opening commentary on EMCOR's third quarter, as well as provide a brief update on our year-to-date results through September 30. All financial information referenced this morning is derived from our consolidated financial statements included in both our earnings release announcement and Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier today. So let's revisit and expand overview of EMCOR's third quarter performance. Consolidated revenues of $2.52 billion are up $320 million or 14.5% over Quarter 3, 2020 and represent a new all-time quarterly revenue record for EMCOR. Each of our reportable segments experienced quarter-over-quarter revenue growth. Excluding $50.3 million of revenues attributable to businesses acquired, pertaining to the time that such businesses are not owned by EMCOR and last year's quarter, revenues for the third quarter of 2021 increased nearly $270 million or a strong 12.2% when compared to the third quarter of 2020, which was still somewhat impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The specifics of each reportable segment are as follows: United States Electrical Construction revenues of $527.9 million increased $55.9 million or 11.8% from 2020s third quarter. Excluding acquisition revenues within the segment of $29.5 million this segment's revenues grew organically 5.6% quarter-over-quarter. Increased project activity within the commercial healthcare and institutional market sectors were the primary drivers of the period over period improvement. United States mechanical construction segment revenues of $999.6 million increased $108.1 million or 12.1% from Quarter 3, 2020. The results of this segment represent a new quarterly revenue record. Revenue growth during the quarter was driven by increases within the manufacturing, healthcare and commercial market sectors. With respect to the manufacturing market sector, we are in the early phases of construction on several food processing plants, which will accelerate further as we move into 2022. From a healthcare market sector perspective, there continues to be greater demand for our services, as we are engaged in a number of projects ranging from mechanical system retrofits to complete installations in both new and existing healthcare facilities. Lastly, within the commercial market sector, we continue to see strong demand for data center project work given growth in digital storage and cloud computing across the United States. And we continue to assist our e-commerce customers with the build out of the warehouse and distribution network through both traditional mechanical as well as fire protection services. Third quarter revenues from EMCOR's combined United States construction business of $1.53 billion increased $164 million or 12%, with 9.9% of such revenue growth being organic. This combined revenue performance eclipses the quarterly revenue record established by this group during the second quarter of this year. Despite this record revenue performance, each of our construction segments have increased the remaining performance obligations both year-over-year as well as sequentially. United States Building Services Quarterly revenues of $632.5 million increased $75.9 million or 13.6%. Excluding acquisition revenues of $20.8 million the segment's revenues increased at 9.9% organically. Revenue gains were reported within our mobile mechanical services division due to increase project, service repair and maintenance activities. Our commercial site based services division as a result of new contract awards, and our government services division given an increase in indefinite delivery indefinite quantity project volumes. EMCOR's industrial services segment revenues of $232.2 million increased $60.7 million or 35.4% due to improve demand for both field and shop services, as we are beginning to see some resumption of maintenance and small capital spending in the energy sector. United Kingdom Building Services revenues of $129.5 million increased $19.4 million or 17.6% from last year's quarter. Revenue gains for the quarter resulted from the continuation of strong project demand from the segment's maintenance customers who previously deferred such work during 2020 as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic in the related prolonged U.K. government lockdown measures. Additionally, the segment's revenues were positively impacted by $8 million, a favorable foreign exchange rate movements within the quarter. Please turn to slide eight. Selling, General, Administrative expenses of $243.9 million represent 9.7% of third quarter revenues and compared to $226.8 million or 10.3% of revenues in the year ago period. The current year's quarter includes approximately $5.3 million of incremental expenses from businesses acquired, inclusive of intangible asset amortization, resulting in an organic quarter-over-quarter increase in SG&A of $11.9 million. Consistent with my commentary during our second quarter earnings call, the prior year period benefited from substantial cost reductions resulting from our actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant percentage of such savings pertained to employment costs, including furloughs, headcount, reductions, and temporary salary reductions. Conversely, EMCOR's considerable revenue growth in 2021 has necessitated an increase in headcount in the current year. Additionally, our SG&A for the current period reflects an increase in health care costs, as the result of a normalization in the level of medical claims, as well as greater travel and entertainment expense due to a partial resumption of certain business activities by our workforce, when compared to the same timeframe in 2020. The reduction in SG&A as a percentage of revenues as a result of the aforementioned increase in quarterly revenues without a commensurate increase in certain of our overhead costs, as we were able to successfully leverage our cost structure during this period of strong organic revenue growth. Reported operating income for the quarter of $137.4 million or 5.4% of revenues, compares to operating income of $135.9 million or 6.2% of revenues in 2020's third quarter. The 80 basis point reduction in operating margin loss due to reductions in gross profit margin within several reportable segments due to a less favorable revenue mix, which I will elaborate on during my individual segment commentary. Despite this reduction in quarter-over-quarter operating margin, EMCOR's $137.4 million of operating income represent a new third quarter record. Specific quarterly performance by segment is as follows: Our U.S. Electrical Construction segment operating income of $44.1 million decreased $1.9 million from the comparable 2020 period. Reported operating margin of 8.3% represents a reduction from the 9.7% margin reported in 2020's third quarter. The decrease in both operating income and operating margin is due to a decline in gross profit within the commercial and transportation market sectors given a change in the composition of project work performed quarter-over-quarter. In addition, and as disclosed in last year's third quarter, the results from the prior year period benefited from the settlement of final contract value on two projects, which favorably impacted this segments Q3, 2020 operating income and operating margin by $4.4 million and 70 basis points respectfully. Third quarter operating income for U.S. Mechanical Construction Services segment of $82.3 million represents a $2.3 million increase from last year's quarter, while operating margin of 8.2% represents an 80 basis point reduction from the 9% earned in 2020's 3rd quarter. From an operating margin perspective similar to our Electrical Construction segment the reduced profitability can be attributed to a less favorable mix of work during the quarter. Most notably, this segment experienced a decrease in gross profit margin within the manufacturing market sector, as the results for the period include increased revenues from certain large food processing projects, for which we are for which we are acting as the construction manager and carry lower than average gross profit margins when compared to our traditional subcontractor arrangements with our customers. Further, the results for the year ago period benefited from the favorable close out of several manufacturing projects, which resulted in incremental operating margin contribution. To be clear, the impacts within the quarter for both our Construction Segments relate to discrete projects or events. It should not be misconstrued as representative of a margin expectations for our on-going projects and service contracts included in remaining performance obligations, which Tony will cover in detail later this morning. Our combined U.S. Construction business is reporting $126.4 million of operating income with an 8.3% operating margin. This level of operating income represents a new third quarter record for our combined construction business. I would like to add that though below that of the prior year, the operating margins today in 2021 for each of our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments exceed both their three year and five year average margins. Operating income for U.S. building services is $31.6 million or 5% of revenues. This represents a reduction of $6.9 million and 190 basis points of operating margin quarter-over-quarter. Growth and operating income within the segment's commercial site based and government services divisions was not enough to offset the clients within its mobile, mechanical and energy services divisions. As I commented during last quarter's call, our Mobile Mechanical Services Division has a large number of fixed price capital projects currently in process, which traditionally have a lower gross profit margin profile than the segments call out service and small project work. In addition, during the quarter, we experienced some productivity issues partially due to the delayed receipt of certain equipment and materials, which has impacted our profitability both in terms of dollars and margin. Lastly, growth in the segment's SG&A expenses due to headcount additions to support revenue growth, as well as incremental amortization expense related to businesses acquired further compressed operating income and operating margin. Our U.S. Industrial Services segment operating loss of $3 million represents a $5.9 million improvement from the $8.9 million loss reported in 2020's 3rd quarter. Development improvement, this segment continues to be impacted by difficult market conditions within the oil and gas industry. Additionally, though, not as severe as in the prior year quarter, this segment experienced lost workdays due to both temporary plant and certain customer site closures, resulting from named storm activity in the Gulf Coast region during the 2021 quarter. U.K. Building Services operating income of $6.6 million or 5.1% of revenues represents an increase of $1.3 million and a 30 basis point improvement and operating margin quarter-over-quarter. Approximately $400,000 of this period-over-period improvement is due to positive foreign exchange movement, with the remainder attributable to an increase in project activity primarily within the commercial market sector. We are now on slide nine. Additional financial items of significance for the quarter not addressed in the previous slides are as follows: Quarter three gross profit of $381.3 million is higher than the comparable quarter by $18.2 million or 5%, gross margin of 15.1% as lower than the 16.5% and last year's third quarter due to the shift in revenue mix in each of our U.S. Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments as well as their U.S. building services segment as I just referenced during my segment operating income discussion. Diluted earnings per common share of $1.85 represents a new quarterly record for the company and compares to $1.11 per diluted share in last year's third quarter. Adjusting 2020's EPS for the negative impact and our prior year income tax rate resulting from the non-deductible portion of last year's non-cash impairment charges recorded during 2020 second quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 was $1.76 when compared to our current quarter's performance, we are reporting a $0.09 or 5.1% quarter-over-quarter earnings per share improvement. Please turn to slide 10. With my quarter commentary complete, I will touch on some high level highlights with respect to EMCOR's results for the first nine months of 2021. Revenues of $7.26 billion represent an increase of $747.8 million, or 11.5%, of which 9.4% of such revenue growth was generated by organic activities. Operating income of $387.8 million or 5.3% of revenues represents a significant increase from reported operating income for the first nine months of 2020 and a double digit increase from the corresponding adjusted non-GAAP operating income figure for that period. Year-to-date diluted earnings per share is $5.17 and represents an increase of approximately 14% over 2020's adjusted non-GAAP EPS for the nine month period. Although not shown on the slide, my last comment on our year-to-date results is with respect to operating cash flow. For the first nine months of 2021, we have generated approximately $114 million of operating cash flow, which is well below 2020s record performance. As I commented last quarter, our substantial organic revenue growth has required increased working capital investment. This contrast to 2020 where for a large part of the year, we were liquidating our balance sheet due to the revenue declines resulting for the from the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, it is important to note that last year's nine month operating cash flow was favorably impacted by $82.3 million due to government stimulus measures that allow for the deferral of certain tax payments in both the United States and the United Kingdom. As previously communicated, my expectation for full year 2021 was operating cash flow in excess of $300 million. With our upward revision in 2021 revenue expectations, I am still targeting the same level of operating cash flow performance, but it is possible that we may not eclipse the $300 million target should our working capital investment be greater than expected during the fourth quarter. Please turn to slide 11. EMCOR's balance sheet remains strong and liquid. Cash on hand is down from year-end 2020 driven by cash used in financing activities are approximately $213 million, inclusive of $183 million used for the repurchase of our common stock and cash used in investing activities of $137.5 million, most notably due to payments for acquisitions that have cash acquired totaling approximately $114 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by cash provided by operations of $114 million as I noted just a few moments ago. Working capital has increased by nearly $20 million. Increases in accounts receivable on contract assets resulting from our substantial organic revenue growth during the period were partially offset by the decrease in our cash balance just referenced as well as our increase in contract liabilities. The increase in goodwill is predominantly a result of the five businesses acquired during the first nine months of this year. Net identifiable intangible assets increased by $19 million as the impact of additional intangible assets recognize the connection with the previously referenced acquisitions which was largely offset by $48 million of amortization expense during the year-to-date period. As a reference point, on a full year basis we anticipate depreciation and amortization expense, including both depreciation of property, plant and equipment, as well as amortization of intangible assets to be approximately $112 million for 2021. Total debt exclusive of operating lease liabilities is fairly consistent with that of December 2020. And EMCOR's debt-to-capitalization ratio has reduced to 11.4% from 11.9% at year-end, 2020. EMCOR remains well positioned to capitalize on available opportunities as our balance sheet, combined with the borrowing capacity available to us under our credit agreement provides us with great flexibility and pursuing numerous organic and strategic investments. With my portion of this morning slide presentation completed. I would like to give a call back to Tony, Tony? No, Tony. I think Sean what, it's unprecedented, at least in my professional career. And not to overplay this. But I think, the fact that we have long standing relationships within our supply chain certainly advantageous to us. But ultimately, there's a lot of things that have to happen on the front end, in order for us to continue to be successful. And we all contingency plan to the best that we can. But ultimately, there's only so much we could do. And I think we've been successful today. And based on our revision and earnings guidance, we don't see any reason why we will not continue to have the same level of success as we move forward through the end of 2021. Yes. Adam, really nothing to add to that. I think, when you look at our year-to-date, margin performance, it is quite strong. Clearly, because of the complexity of this business, you do get some margin fluctuations, quarter-to-quarter depending on the timing of work. We are, we are on the front end of a lot of large work right now. And, as our history has indicated, we tend to, we tend to be a little bit more cautious with profit recognition at that point until we're fully established on the job site. And clearly with, the everything that was required as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic we're being extra cautious with regards to our labor on site, and obviously, how we're working with the other trades around us. So, we certainly did not tell our operating teams to reduce their level of expectation for profitability and work as they're approaching their markets. We're clearly requiring the same level of excellent execution amongst all of our projects and service opportunities, so that so that it hasn't changed. So I don't see that our future is going to look any different than our than our recent past. And we're going to continue to perform well, for all of our stakeholders. Yes, Zane. I mean, clearly, the storm activity in the current year, third quarter was not as exaggerated as it was a year ago. But clearly Ida and to a lesser extent, Tropical Storm Nicholas were impactful, most impactful to our customers who basically they had a closer facility as a result of that, which ended up deferring some of the work that we were anticipating and doing in the third quarter. So that work, for the most part is has trickled into quarter four. However, some of that looks like it actually might trickle into the first quarter of 2022. So certainly impactful. But last year's quarter was much more impacted by the rest. I believe there was five named storms in the third quarter of 20, calendar 2020. Most of which did impact us our customers in some way, shape or form. So we, we did have lost workdays this quarter, but still, we're all happy with the performance of that segment, certainly on a comparative basis to a year ago and how that market is developing for us as we move forward in the year."

            "content": "Good Morning. Thanks, Kevin. And thanks for joining our call. My opening comments will reference pages four through six of our presentation. As we have navigated the last two years, we have learned to operate in highly uncertain and volatile environment. And we have done it with success on almost any metric. We've had to accomplish our mission while keeping our people safe. Our company values of Mission First People always have served us extremely well throughout these unprecedented times. We had an exceptional third quarter at EMCOR, especially against a very difficult comparison in the prior year. As you may recall, in the third quarter of last year, we were bringing about a third of our company back to full operations. We had projects poised and ready to resume or start, delay service that needed to be completed. And buildings, campuses and production facilities that we helped our customers reopen as they resumed operations. Further, we had yet to bring back our full complement of staff that we need to sustain and build our operations. Said simply, we had an abundance of work had all the materials and a lower cost base, as we were still returning to full operations after the extreme cost reductions we had taken in response to the pandemic. Against that backdrop in comparison for the third quarter of 2021, we were able to post $1.85 and earnings per diluted share, versus $1.76 of adjusted diluted earnings per share in the year ago period. We grew revenues to $2.52 billion, with 14.5% overall revenue growth and 12.2% organic revenue growth. We posted 5.4% operating income margins despite strong headwinds from supply chain issues and labor disruptions caused by the Delta Variant. I believe this is very good performance considering the operating conditions we faced in the quarter. We grew remaining performance obligations or RPOs 18.7% from the year ago period to $5.38 billion. We generated operating cash flow of $121 million, despite the strong organic revenue growth. All-in-all, we had a very successful quarter that continues to show the strength and diversity of our business. But more importantly, the outstanding leadership provided by our teams at the subsidiary, segment and corporate level. Our electrical and mechanical construction segments had excellent performance in the third quarter of 2021. Both segments posted strong operating income margins, and had strong organic revenue growth. Through careful planning on our large projects, and excellent supplier relationships we mitigated a lot of the supply chain disruptions facing our operations. However, we have seen cost increases of 10% to 20% and anticipate that such increases will continue in the near future. And that is only part of the issue, as we have seen lead times increased by two to three times their normal levels. Our success in the quarter points to the continued resiliency of our teams, the ability to navigate these issues, deliver for our customers and continue to keep our workforce productive and safe. We continue to have a robot pipeline of data center, warehousing and healthcare projects. And we had strong bookings with our manufacturing clients in the quarter. Building Services had the most difficult comparison a quarter as a deep cost cuts taken at the height of the shutdown were most severe in the segment. We still post a decent operating income marked as a 5% against the year ago period of 6.9%. However, we were most affected in this segment by supply chain issues and diminished productivity. Although demand for our retrofit project work is very strong, we had some issues with a synchronization of our supply chain with our labor planning, resulting in reduced productivity. To mitigate these issues, it has become a common practice that daily communications on deliveries and price changes on our quick term project and service work. Further, this segment also bears the brunt of the dollar per gallon increase in the fuel, which gasoline and diesel year-over-year due to its large fleet and this had an impact of 20 to 30 basis points on operating income margins. We can pass some of this increase on our customers that had just repriced into our time and material rates in June. We will do so again between now and January across the majority of our building services operations. This is the second increase this year, which is not our usual practice of executing which is once a year, usually in June. Demand remained strong and we will continue to improve our planning over the next quarter or two. Industrial Services continue to operate as we expected. We improved on a year-over-year basis with respect to revenue and operating income. We had some impact with respect to the storms in the Gulf Coast. But that mainly just pushed out work to later in the year or into next year. And we did have some disruption to our shop work in Louisiana. Demand for our services continues to build. Refinery utilization is at a very high level. And we expect to and we expect to execute a better fourth quarter turnaround season this year versus the year ago period. We also anticipate much improved demand as we exit the year and move into the first quarter of 2022. The U.K. continues to execute well for its customers with double digit revenue growth and good operating income margins. Demand remained strong for our services. But like in the United States, we are also battling supply chain issues for our quick term project work in the United Kingdom. We'll leave the quarter with a pristine balance sheet, strong fundamentals and record RPOs. And with that Mark, I'll turn it over to you. Thanks Mark. And I'm going to be on page 12 remaining performance obligations by segment and market sector. We had another strong project bookings quarter here at EMCOR. Each of our five reporting segments are RPO growth year-over-year, while as we mentioned earlier, simultaneously increasing revenue over the same period. We also saw RPO growth in seven of the eight market sectors in which we report. By definition, RPO and project bookings are forward-looking. So it's fair to say that we're currently seeing strong future demand across all of our segments and market sectors. While September 30, is a single point in time, and project certainly ebb and flow, we are well positioned moving into 2022. As mentioned earlier, total company RPOs at the end of the third quarter were just under $5.4 billion, up $849 million or 18.7% when compared to the year ago level of $4.5 billion. Organic RPO growth was strong 15.6%. Year-to-date for the nine months completed in 2021 total RPOs have increased $784 million, or just over 17%. The strong booking activity across the company trends related to a book-to-bill ratio well over one, despite the company generating record revenues. Our two domestic construction segments experienced strong construction project growth in the quarter, with RPOs increasing $606 million or 16.5% from the same period last year. RPOs were lifted slightly by two Midwestern Electrical Construction Services acquisitions completed this year. Building Services or RPO levels increased 180 million or almost 29% from the year ago quarter, 142 million and 180 million was organic. We continue to see widespread small and short duration project demand and believe this will remain active through the end of the year and into 2022 as workers returned to buildings, campuses, factories and institutional facilities across the country post COVID and as the Delta variant hopefully continues to subside. Our Industrial Services segments, our RPO increase of $53 million from September 2020. Work within our heat exchanger shops has been building and while still are lower than historical levels, pricing appears to be improving a bit. Further, we continue to build capability, execute fixed price contract work, in both our electrical and mechanical trades in this segment. While this segment remains challenged due to macroeconomic forces, we are starting to see signs of increased activity, much as we expected as we move into 2022 and that is good news. In summary, we continue to see strong momentum in our core markets and our scale, diversity of demand, and ability to pivot to more resilient sectors has allowed us to continue to have strong bookings in RPO growth, but also very strong organic revenue growth. I'm now going to finish our discussion on pages 15 and 16. We are closing in on yet another record year performance at EMCOR despite a very difficult operating environment. At the beginning of the year, we expected that margins would be under some pressure. But we believe that we would have the necessary revenue growth to offset any margin compression. We foresaw the supply chain issues, but quite frankly, they are worse than we expected. We not only have seen increasing and volatile pricing, but lead times that extend through two to three times normal levels. Energy prices, especially gasoline and diesel costs have increased by more than we anticipated. We also expect COVID to be much less impactful than it was as a Delta variant caused disruption on some job sites and send some key supervision into quarantine. Working in this challenging environment, we continue to deliver in a no excuses manner and execute well for our customers while keeping our employees safe. Despite such headwinds, we are raising our guidance. Our new guidance is diluted earnings per share of $6.95 to $7.15 and we now expect our revenues between $9.80 billion and $9.85 billion. As we close on 2021, we do expect to continue to be challenged by supply chain and productivity issues. But we will work through them as we are resilient. We expect the non-residential market to show mid-single digit growth in 2021 and expect that momentum to continue into 2022. We, like all large employers will have to navigate complying with the pending emergency temporary standard or ETS with respect to mandatory vaccination and testing and the executive order mandating vaccination on federal contracts. The ETS has not been released and therefore the related costs to comply and the impact to our productivity are unknown. We expect to energy generate additional operating cash flow in the fourth quarter. And we expect to continue to be balanced capital allocators. To date into 2021, we have repurchased $183 million in EMCOR stock, paid $21 million in dividends and invested $114 million in acquisitions that will continue to position EMCOR for long term and sustained growth. Our board of directors just authorized a new and our largest share repurchase authorization of an additional $300 million. We continue to have a very active acquisition pipeline. I am thankful for EMCOR team members and leaders for their dedication and resilience as we continue to focus on employee safety, and delivering for our customers. As always, thank you for listening and you interest in EMCOR. And with that, Jerome, I will now take questions. Hi, Sean. Sean, it really comes down to a couple things. The labor availability, I'm going to put to the side for a minute. I think our folks over a very long period of time have figured out how to navigate through labor availability. And now we have learned how to navigate through disruptions to labor, with the pandemic, on our job sites. So I think we know how to do that. I think we'll get through that. And we've done it before in high growth markets. We're blessed with some of the best local management that you can have that really understands their labor, and understands how to keep good supervision on job sites. Going to the second point on supply chain. I think now's the time in some ways you get rewarded for being a good partner. EMCOR has never been known as a company that takes advantage of its suppliers on terms or doesn't do what we say we're going to do. We also don't blame suppliers for things that were our problems, which could be common practice in our industry at times. So we're known as a pretty good partner for a supplier. And that's paying dividends. Now, where you see that most is at the distribution level. Most of what we buy comes through distribution in some form or another. And we have very good OEM relationships. And because of our scale, we have the ability to make sure on our most important jobs, that we can keep availability, as good or better than anybody else. The thing that might be a little bit different in this playbook right now is how you deal with the short term quick term service work. One of the things we pride ourselves on is keeping our customers facilities, factories, educational facilities, institutions, healthcare facilities up and running. When someone makes a commitment to us on a six week project, that the materials are going to be there, we believe them. And in today's world, I think that's become more problematic, not because our suppliers don't think they can deliver it in that time period, is that sometimes they can't. So we've had to go the extra mile and communications. And it really has changed some of our planning. Before we something as similar as demo something, we mean by that is demolish something, so that we can build because we have to keep our customers facilities running. And it couldn't be as simple as we were getting really good at on time, right on right on place, delivery of service parts. I think some of that's going to go by the wayside for the next six to nine months, as we just like to make sure we have it in our hands before we start a repair. So a lot of variables going on. It's 1000 details. So the first one is labor availability, a lot of communication. The second way is a supply chain, having been a good partner or being rewarded for that now. Lots of communications, don't get to advance in the project until you're sure that you have the materials you need to execute to the next part of the project. And then the third one is be very clear on contract terms. I'm actually pleased with how we've been able to work with our customers through these supply chain issues and through the pandemic. Everybody seems to have the attitude right now that we're all in this to some extent together. And we're just trying to get to completion and get and get a building built, get a data center built, get it commissioned in online and a lot of planning has to go on is less than ideal. Unfortunately, things like this teach you new lessons that in some ways will make you better long term. But I would just leave you with this. The supply chain issues are unprecedented. I'm seeing lead times I've never seen in my career, and I've been doing this a long time. That is almost as big of an issue for us as pricing or is a bigger issue. Mark, any add up? Yes, look Sean, we've always had the belief that we typically in a good market grow little grow better than what the non-res markets going to grow. We are in some resilient sectors. And so we're not going to hold back when we can win good work, and we can responsibly execute that work. And so if you look at our RPO's we believe that that's representative of what we think we can accomplish at those elevated levels. I think what happens in this kind of environment, and we've seen this over the last two or three years, is there's a definite especially at the two ends, right? Owners, when you're doing a service project or retrofit project, want to go with quality people that know how to do the work and can plan and you think about it, there would even be more reason to want to deal with a company like ours, because they know that we have the resources to make that happen. And on the top end, at the project level, you're competing against a budget a lot of times now, but people want to be with well resource companies. And that's beyond just financial strength. That's what the resources to actually do the planning to learn from each other, to be able to draw on the kind of supplier relationships Mark and I talked about, and to have very clear communications on what we can accomplish and on what schedule. So I don't think there's a fixed amount which say this company can grow. It's very much a bunch of individual decisions and local markets and sectors. And I think the appetite for larger projects is out there with some of our owners. I tell you what you do see in this kind of environment, I think what we're benefiting. From some of our construction manager, general contractor customers in a market that may have less complication, sometimes would like to cut up a job, right and give different pieces to different people. In this kind of environment you'd rather be with somebody like us and let us worry about multiple parts of the project and multiple trades on that project. And what I mean by that is not necessarily or mixing or electrical mechanical work, but we can take a greater mechanical scope or greater electrical scope on a project and so we are seeing that. And that might be what part of what's underlying that RPO growth. Thanks, Sean. Thanks, Adam. Adam, I don't have any reason to believe that we didn't we don't we haven't booked work at an acceptable margin. Now, margins fluctuate quarter to quarter as Mark talked about. We're still well above even in the quarter, three year average. If you've been following us a long time. I think you would agree for the most part. These are very good margin levels especially with the headwind that we're seeing in industrial with no real operating income margin contribution. Some of that has to do with contract structure, as you get to the bigger jobs, right, you might be working on more GMP or guaranteed maximum price type contracts that adjust. And there's more cost transparency, some of it will have to do with the quick turn service work in the margin there. So we don't ever sit there and say, hey, there's a specific margin of backlog we're looking for, quite frankly, it's a tough thing to measure. But we do look for say, do we have the right work? The right people, and the right tool is to earn an acceptable return on capital employed, and return on investment and return on labor for that project work. So we feel good about what we have in RPO's. We think it's good to mix it we've had, but again, that will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. Mark? Yes, let me let me tie together a couple thoughts there for the broader group. And Adam, you gave us a good opening to do that on page 13, and 14. So we talked about what we had in these resilient sectors in these growth opportunities. And so when you look at page 13 and you see data centers, warehouses, industrial manufacturing, healthcare, water and wastewater, mechanical services, in their quality of fire protection. Everything we've talked about for the last year and a half is still very strong. And some of them really stand out. I mean, fire protection continues to be a very strong market for us. We are the nationwide leader, especially in the installation side. And we got to be two or three on the service side now. This digital buildup, data centers and the digital infrastructure around supply chain that's happening within the country, maybe they should let some of those guys take over the ports and figure out how to get that done. But what we're doing within the country is pretty strong. Well the data center market continues very strong as the infrastructure for the supply chain for the big delivery services. Industrial manufacturing continues to be two, I think three stories for us. The first story is we're really good at tech manufacturing and supporting tech manufacturing. And you think what's going to happen with a chip build out, we're well positioned in a couple markets where that's going to take place. You think what's happening in food processing, which is going to continue to grow. We're very well positioned with our Shambaugh subsidiary. They have some nice opportunity in front of them, they tend to be episodic. But that team knows really knows how to execute, as does our tech manufacturing people. And finally, the reshoring of manufacturing is a real trend. And the supply chain issues continue to exacerbate that. We've been talking about it for two or three years. We continue to see that and you really see it and things like the things on a pharma, grid resiliency, and finally on building products, you see it in all three of those areas. Healthcare continues to be a good market for us. And it's going to continue to be. One thing we learned in the pandemic. And I think our healthcare customers obviously are dead serious people. And as a result of that, they're looking to build more resiliency and more flexibility into their facilities. And they realize their mechanical systems especially may need to be updated and made more flexible. Water wastewater for us as a more localized market on the mechanical side, much more natural on the electrical side certainly not as big as scope, mechanical services, indoor air quality and energy retrofit are all very strong markets for us. What you're seeing a little bit in the building services margin is not so much that the work wasn't good at RPO is what you're seeing in some ways is, is that's where the supply chain issues came to a head the fastest. That team knows how to execute, they've been correcting it, maybe we had a couple 25% of the problem was ours, but 75% was probably externally gender driven. And across all those sectors, the fire protection business remains very strong. I would add one more, and that's respect to energy transition. I mean, clearly, as a big trade contractor, we have something that's very valuable for people to use. We will participate in the energy transition, and already are. We have a solar capability. We've done some projects, both in our electrical segment. And we've now started to really build a capability in our industrial services segment to do that work. That work has long lead time, though. I mean, and will participate there. We also do a solar work and conducting with our mechanical services work, especially in states like California, New Jersey, and in New York, and some in Arizona. So we do that work today. And it's more, low megawatt megawatt or less provider, versus the 200 megawatt sites that our electrical segment may do, or our electrical work, trades in the industrial services. And then finally, as you start thinking about things longer term like carbon capture this pipe, and there'll be a lot of piping done around that. And that will happen both in our mechanical construction segment, and our industrial services segment. And we're in the best on some of those ideas. In the first or second ending, we're seeing our customers already start to talk to us about us and the capability we'll have there. And in the thing you don't think as much about and something we are participating in on the industrial services segment. And again, it's in the first inning is the renewable fuels that some of our refinery customers are actually adapting their facility to do and again, it's electrical system upgrades, and as pipe, both of which we're pretty good at. So put all that together. We feel good about some of these growing markets. Now go to page 14, we have some headwinds, right. I mean, everybody's wrestling with the same thing right now on supply chain. And you're going to worse, what did we expect it to be in here, when we make guidance that as the year progressed, if you remember, we were doing a little bit of whining about supply chain. In our first quarter call, in our second quarter call, we did a little more whining. And here in the third quarter call, we're talking about it more. So we expected good availability, but some price increase, material prices are volatile, and increasing. But that second point, we make on that chat on the lead times. So market will probably see right, if the projects are going to go, they'll move forward, they may slide to the right, you see some of that already in our numbers. And so what that really affects for us is our ability to recognize revenue or profit at a certain time, because versus what we plan. And sometimes we may have a gap, right. We may have labor that we need to keep on board because the schedule has been elongate a little bit. We're pretty good about not doing that. But that could be one of the productivity issues that we wrestle with. So you know, Adam, you gave us a chance to talk more comprehensively about it. But I hope that answers a lot of folks questions about how all this knits together. Good morning, Zane. Mark, I want to turn that to you. Yes Mark, I think one of the things we see, in general with industrial services Zane is, we've communicated correctly, here at this level, about what how we thought the year was going to roll out and how things would strengthen and where the opportunities would be. We can only do that, because that tells you how intuitive our folks are with their customers, and what kind of position we have with our customers to be able to actually get a pretty good handle on how the markets evolving. I don't think that's necessarily that common with some of our competitors. But it shows you the depth of our customer relationships, but also the sort of market awareness that our team has. The other thing is, when you get to that, the impact of storms, we can't control what happens within our customers. But we've started to do a much better job of in our case, is we've done more and more things to harden our facilities to be able to withstand the storms, much better than over the last 18 months than we had previously. And we're going to continue to do that. Yes, so I've been a consistent whiner over probably 10 years, complaining about the prices private equity will pay and the things they will do and deal structure. You know what, somehow we've managed to do a bunch of very successful deals with the right people at the right time. And I think our acquisition program over the last five years, has been as well executed as well integrated as almost any time in our history. I think it has been the best time in our history for M&A. All that being said, we've made some progress, right. We've done $114 million here today. I think the way we've described it, we expect to be able to at least replicate what we've done from 2017 through 2024. Deals happen when they happen. We have a lot of discussions going on. It's a pretty active market for every one deal that may even get to the point where I look at, we've looked at 10. Our business development team, and they're really good at working with our segment people to get that down to something we can look at. We've done some creative things around the companies we've just bought, we bought our first ESOP and we did extraordinarily well. And we're very happy with the incorporation of that very fine electrical contractor in the Midwest into our family. That was something we hadn't done before. And but we figured out how to do that. And when that opportunity presents itself, we will be a buyer that tends, we think that could be a good market for us. We aren't competitive when it's a broad auction with 15 private equity people thrown in numbers bidding the book. So, I'd say more of the same. We continue to see opportunities, and we love where our balance sheet is to be able to do those deals. We can always look at somebody and say, we can close. And we can close without condition on financing. And add one other thing, I'm proud of speaking. We continue to attract folks that are selling their life's work, or their families, generational life's work. And we're good home for those companies. And I was in a discussion several weeks, a week ago with someone. And you could see the pride of that person of what they build as a team. And hopefully, we'll be able to make that deal here at EMCOR. And we're out there doing that all the time. So all that being said, and okay, environment. I'll add one other thing when you go to the balance sheet. We take for granted, the success we've had with our balance sheet. That balance sheet is a point of competitive differentiation for us. I believe and I think Mark believes and our segment leadership believes that having that liquidity on our balance sheet is something these bigger customers look to, because they know we're going to complete the job. They know we're going to have the working capital to get it done. And they know that we're not going to it's sort of endemic of how we think about the business overall. We take measured risk, and that's how they want us to do if they're trusting us to do an $80 million project that's going to burn in 13 months in his critical data infrastructure. So you can't separate the two. And it's not only a point to allow us to firepower for acquisitions, but some of this good great underlying organic growth you see it because customers trust us to be measured conservative and thoughtful, and how we approach the overall business. Thank you Yes, thanks to you all. It's certainly been an interesting year. And I want to then just finish by thanking our EMCOR employees, our subsidiary teams, you've done a great job, our segment teams. I know the four of us sitting around this table today feel blessed to be able to be on the same team as you all. Stay safe. And I'm not going to wish you a happy Halloween because it's probably the holiday I care at least about, but we won't see until after the holiday. So Happy Thanksgiving, and happy holiday season. Thanks. Bye."

And upfront here, I am going to be covering pages four to six. And you take a step back, what a difference a year makes? When we reported our second quarter 2020 numbers, we were in the throes of a pandemic with no clear end in sight. Although, COVID-19 cases in some geographies are rising again. We are in a much more stable environment and have much better visibility with respect to our operations than a year ago. We remain focused on our employee safety as we continue to work in this environment. We had a very strong operating quarter, with revenues of $2.44 billion, operating income of $133 million and earnings per diluted share of $1.78. We maintained strong operating income margins of 5.5% and had revenue growth of 21% overall, with 18% organic revenue growth. It is important to remember that in second quarter 2020 we had several of our key geographic markets either shutdown or partially shutdown. This revenue growth resulted in a sizeable investment in working capital this quarter, leading to a more typical cash flow pattern for us than in the prior year, during which we were liquidating our balance sheet due to COVID-19 imposed lockdowns and customer site restrictions. Regardless of the unusual factors impacting our comparison against last year, we had a very strong quarter. Our business trends are strong. We grew our remaining performance obligations, and I\u2019ll refer to them as RPOs for the rest of the presentation to a record $5.1 billion and had substantial growth in our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments, as well as in our Building Services segment. This RPO growth was broad based across market sectors and geographies. For the quarter, we continued to see excellent operational execution in both our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments. We had revenue growth in our Electrical Construction segment of 19.3% and in our Mechanical segment up 21.3%, which I believe reflects more than just resumption of normal demand from the COVID impacted results of the second quarter last year. With Mechanical Construction operating income margins of 8.3% and Electrical Construction operating income margins of 8.7%, we are executing with discipline and precision as we grow our business. We had broad based growth across our trade offerings and market sectors, and across our geographic footprint. We had especially strong growth within the commercial and that\u2019s really across commercial with data centers and logistical infrastructure drove that, and healthcare market sectors. Our large project work and small quick term project work are both strong from a revenue and booking perspective. We continue to work very hard to bid and schedule our work amid the uncertainty around material pricing and availability. Our team is experienced with this issue and so far we have weathered this challenge. But it requires attention to detail, communication with our supply chain partners and customers, thoughtful planning, and careful contract negotiations. The supply chain pressures are likely to be with us for most of the balance of the year. Again, I sound redundant, but we are blessed with an execution-oriented culture across EMCOR. Our Electrical and Mechanical Construction teams are some of the best operators in the business. We leave the quarter with very strong RPO growth across these segments of almost 8% from the year ago period and nearly 10% from the end of 2020 and this is despite very strong revenue growth. Our U.S. Building Services segment had a very strong quarter, with revenue growth of 30.4% and operating income growth of 13.9%. Operating income margins were strong at 4.9%. RPOs additionally increased 37.8% versus the year ago period, and organically, RPOs are up 21.2%. We see accelerating demand for HVAC retrofit projects with a special emphasis on energy retrofit and IAQ or indoor air quality. We\u2019re also performing very well in our commercial site-based business with strong bookings year-to-date and several important customer wins. We are not only executing for our current customers, but are winning new work and have a very healthy pipeline of opportunities in this business. We expect to continue to see strong demand for our mechanical services, as well as our commercial site-based business services as customers seek to improve their facilities as they emerge from the pandemic. Our Building Services team has done an exceptional job of anticipating our customers\u2019 needs post-pandemic and we are a key partner in making these facilities more energy efficient and safer with improved air quality and movement. In our Industrial Services segment, we had a near breakeven performance on an operating income basis, despite taking a $4 million charge for a receivable from a customer who recently entered into bankruptcy protection. We had positive EBITDA and I believe we will start seeing better revenue comparisons as we move through the second half of 2021. We do expect our forward view to improve as customer inquiries and scheduling are at very robust levels for late 2021 and early 2022, crack spreads remain strong and utilization continues to improve. Our U.K. Building Services segment had another strong quarter, with operating income growth of 31.7%. We continue to execute well for our customers in the U.K. and have strong retrofit project growth and also for our full facilities management offering. Overall, a very strong quarter and we remain poised to deliver for our customers and shareholders for the remainder of 2021. We\u2019ve had a great start to the year and I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t thank our employees for their focus on safety first, while delivering results for our customers and shareowners in an ever changing environment. With that, I will turn the discussion over to Mark.\nMark Pompa: Thank you, Tony, and good morning to everyone participating on our call today. For those accessing this presentation via the webcast we are now on slide seven. Over the next several slides, I will supplement Tony\u2019s opening commentary on EMCOR\u2019s second quarter performance, as well as provide a brief update on our year-to-date results through June 30th. All financial information referenced this morning is derived from our consolidated financial statements, included in both our earnings release announcement and Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier today. So, let\u2019s revisit and expand our review of EMCOR\u2019s second quarter performance. Consolidated revenues of $2.44 billion are up $423.6 million or 21% over quarter two 2020. Our second quarter results included $53.8 million of revenues attributable to businesses acquired pertaining to the time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in last year\u2019s second quarter. Acquisition revenues positively impacted both our United States Electrical Construction and United States Building Services segments. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired, second quarter revenues increased nearly $370 million or 18.4% when compared to the second quarter of 2020, which was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the corresponding containment and mitigation measures mandated by certain of our customers, as well as numerous governmental authorities. Despite the less than difficult compare between quarterly periods due to the challenging environment in 2020, EMCOR\u2019s quarter two 2021 revenues represent an all-time quarterly revenue record for the company. The specifics to each of our reportable segments are as follows. United States Electrical Construction segment revenues of $489.5 million increased $79.1 million or 19.3% from 2020 second quarter. Excluding acquisition revenues of $8.6 million, the segment\u2019s revenues increased 17.2% quarter-over-quarter. Significant increases in revenue contribution from projects within the commercial, institutional and healthcare market sectors were the primary drivers of the period-over-period improvement. We continue to see strength in the telecommunication submarket sector, as we experience sustained customer demand for data center projects driving the growth in commercial market sector activity within the segment. United States Mechanical Construction segment revenues of $958.7 million, increased $168.2 million or 21.3% from quarter two last year. Revenue growth was primarily attributable to an increase in commercial and healthcare market sector activities. With respect to the commercial market sector, consistent with the growth experienced by our Electrical Construction segment, this segment also continues to see strong demand for data center project work, given growth in data storage and cloud computing across the country. In addition, the continued build-out of our customers\u2019 e-commerce supply chains has resulted in an increase in the number of fire protection project opportunities for this segment within various warehousing and distribution facilities. With regard to the healthcare market sector, consistent with the trends we experienced during the first quarter of this year, we are engaged in a number of projects ranging from mechanical system retrofits to complete installations in both new and existing healthcare facilities. Second quarter revenues for EMCOR\u2019s combined United States Construction business of $1.45 billion increased $247.3 million or 20.6%. This revenue performance represents an all-time high for our combined Construction segments. Despite this record revenue performance, we increased remaining performance obligations, which Tony briefly covered, within each of these segments as a result of strong project bookings. Tony will cover this in more detail at the completion of my prepared remarks. United States Building Services quarterly revenues of $624.4 million increased $145.5 million or 30.4%. Excluding acquisition revenues in this segment of $45.2 million, the segment\u2019s revenues increased almost 21% organically. This performance also represents an all-time quarterly record for the segment\u2019s revenues. Revenue gains within each of their divisions due to resumption of maintenance and project activity as compared to 2020\u2019s COVID impacted quarter, augmented by incremental projects aimed at improving customers\u2019 indoor air quality, as well as increased building automation and controls activity were the primary drivers of this quarter\u2019s strong revenue performance. EMCOR\u2019s Industrial Services segment revenues of $235.2 million decreased $5.9 million or 2.5% as the segment has yet to return to pre-pandemic revenue levels due to prolonged adverse market conditions within the oil and gas and related industries. Of those still below the prior year, this 2.5% quarter-over-quarter revenue reduction is significantly less than the more abrupt quarterly revenue declines experienced in other quarters post-quarter one of 2020. As Tony previously indicated, we are beginning to see positive signs of demand returning as we look toward -- our turnaround planning for early 2022. Let\u2019s hope that we do not see any additional macroeconomic headwinds impacting this industry. United Kingdom Building Services revenues of $129.9 million increased $36.7 million or 39.5% from last year\u2019s quarter. Resumption of maintenance contract activity that began during quarter one of this year strengthened in quarter two as project work that was deferred in 2020 has recommenced. Additionally, revenues of this segment benefited from $14.5 million of favorable exchange rate movement during the period. Please turn to slide eight. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $242.9 million represent 10% of revenues and reflect an increase of $37.7 million from quarter two 2020. Adjusting for incremental expenses attributable to companies acquired, inclusive of intangible asset amortization, EMCOR\u2019s organic SG&A increase was $33.4 million. As a reminder, the prior year period benefited from substantial cost reductions resulting from actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with significant percentage of such actions pertain to employment costs including furloughs, headcount reductions and temporary salary reductions. Additionally, 2020 second quarter included reduced levels of incentive compensation expense, as a result of the downward recalibration of our internal forecasts, driven by the uncertainty created by the pandemic. In contrast, the results for the second quarter of 2021 include a significant growth in revenues, as well as profitability forecasts, which eclipse EMCOR\u2019s previous earnings performance records across numerous of our operating companies. These factors have necessitated headcount additions to support such growth, as well as increased levels of quarterly incentive compensation accruals. Just so that there is no misunderstanding, at this time last year, we were either reversing the previous quarter\u2019s incentive accruals or accruing at significantly reduced rates, while at this point in 2021, based on our performance for the first six months of the year and our projections for the remainder of the year, our incentive compensation levels are tracking more linear with our current year earnings expectations. In addition to these increases in employment costs, our results for the second quarter of 2021 included a $4.1 million provision for credit losses due to the bankruptcy filing of a customer within our U.S. Industrial Services segment, which negatively impacted our quarterly consolidated SG&A margin by 20 basis points. Reported operating income for the quarter of $133.4 million, compares to an operating loss of $122.6 million in 2020 second quarter, due to the $232.8 million non-cash impairment charge recorded in the prior year. Excluding 2020\u2019s impairment charge, operating income for the current period represents a $23.2 million or 21.1% improvement over last year\u2019s adjusted non-GAAP second quarter operating income of $110.1 million. For the second quarter of 2021, operating margin represents 5.5% of revenues and is consistent with our adjusted non-GAAP operating margin in last year\u2019s quarter. Consistent with our quarterly revenue performance, the operating income of each of our reportable segments other than U.S. Industrial Services has increased by double-digit percentages. Specific quarterly operating performance by reporting segment is as follows. Operating income of our U.S. Electrical Construction Services segment of $42.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2021 increased by $11.1 million from the comparable 2020 period. Reported operating margin of 8.7% represents 100-basis-point improvement over last year\u2019s second quarter due to an improvement in gross profit margin given a more favorable revenue mix and continued strong project execution. Second quarter operating income of our U.S. Mechanical Construction Services segment of $79.3 million increased $12.3 million from the comparable 2020 period. Reported operating margin of 8.3% represents a slight reduction from last year\u2019s quarter. Our over 20% increase in quarterly revenues was the major driver of our period-over-period operating income improvement, while the slight reduction in operating margin resulted from a modest decrease in gross profit margin due to the composition of work performed during each period. Each of our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments established new second quarter records in terms of operating income dollars. Our total U.S. Construction business is reporting $122 million of operating income and 8.4% operating margin. This performance is improved by $23.4 million and 20 basis points from last year\u2019s second quarter. Operating income for U.S. Building Services is $30.3 million or 4.9% of revenues. This represents a $3.7 million improvement quarter-over-quarter and like most of our other reporting segments represents a new second quarter record for operating income dollars. Increased gross profit from the mechanical services and commercial-site-based services divisions due to a strong resumption in demand as compared to 2020\u2019s challenging second quarter was the primary reason for the period-over-period increase in operating income. The 70-basis-point reduction in quarterly operating margin is due to revenue mix, which included a larger percentage of fixed price capital projects that traditionally have a lower gross profit margin profile than the segment\u2019s call-out service work. Our U.S. Industrial Services segment operating loss of approximately $200,000 represents a decrease of $3.5 million from last year\u2019s second quarter operating income of $3.3 million. While the segment experienced an increase in gross profit and gross profit margin during the current quarter, its results include an increase in credit losses due to the aforementioned customer bankruptcy, which negatively impacted operating income by $4.1 million and operating margin of the segment by 180 basis points. Looking ahead, we are encouraged as we are beginning to see signs of improving financial performance albeit in an environment that remains somewhat challenged. U.K. Building Services operating income of $7 million or 5.4% of revenues represents an improvement of $1.7 million with a slight reduction in operating margin over 2020 second quarter. Approximately $800,000 of this period-over-period improvement is due to positive foreign exchange movement with the remainder attributable to an increase in project activity primarily within the commercial market sector. The decrease in quarterly operating margin is a result of an increase in the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to revenues in the current quarter, as the prior year benefited from certain short-term cost-cutting initiatives and actually in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are now on slide nine. Additional financial items of significance for the quarter not addressed on my previous slides are as follows. Quarter two gross profit of $376.3 million, was higher than 2020\u2019s comparable quarter by $61 million or 19.3%. Gross margin of 15.4% is 30 basis points lower than last year\u2019s quarter due to shifts in revenue mix in both our U.S. Mechanical Construction and U.S. Building Services segment within the quarter. Diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of 2021 is $1.78, as compared to a loss per diluted share of $1.52 in the year ago period. On an adjusted basis after adding back the impairment loss on goodwill, identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets recorded last year, 2020\u2019s non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.44. When compared to our current years -- when compared to our current quarter\u2019s performance, we\u2019re reporting a $0.34 or 23.6% quarter-over-quarter EPS improvement. This 2021 quarterly diluted EPS of $1.78 represents a new all-time record for any quarterly period in our history, despite some of the headwinds we continue to face. This is further testimony to the operational excellence demonstrated by our subsidiary and segment teams each and every day for which I am thankful. Please turn to slide 10. With the quarterly commentary complete, I will touch on some high level highlights with respect to EMCOR\u2019s results for the first six months of 2021. Revenues of $4.74 billion represent an increase of $427.9 million or 9.9%. Operating income of $250.4 million or 5.3% of revenues represent sizeable increases from both 2020\u2019s reported and as adjusted non-GAAP six-month results. Year-to-date diluted earnings per share was $3.32. Although not shown on the slide, my last comment on the results for the first six-month period is with respect to our slightly negative operating cash flow as compared to 2020 strong cash flow performance during the first half of the year. With substantial organic revenue growth in this year\u2019s second quarter, we have experienced an increase in working capital investment as both our accounts receivable and contract asset balances have elevated in concert with our project and service volumes. Further, it is important to note that our cash flow for the prior year period was favorably impacted by certain government legislation passed in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, which allowed for the deferral of the employer\u2019s portion of social security taxes throughout the majority of 2020 and also extended the deadline for making estimated federal tax payments from the second to third quarter of last year. These measures, along with the United Kingdom\u2019s deferral of value-added tax in the prior year favorably impacted both our second quarter and six-month operating cash flows in 2020 by almost $100 million. My expectation for full year 2021 is that we will generate operating cash flow in excess of $300 million. Please turn to slide 11. EMCOR\u2019s balance sheet remains strong and liquid. Cash on hand is down from year end 2020 driven by cash used in financing activities of approximately $157 million, inclusive of $138 million used for the repurchase of our common stock and cash used in investing activities of approximately $71 million, most notably due to payments for acquisitions net of cash acquired totaling just shy of $56 million. Working capital levels have increased modestly as increases in accounts receivable and contract assets, resulting from our substantial organic growth during the period, were offset by the decrease in our cash balance just referenced. The increase in goodwill is predominantly a result of the three businesses acquired during the first six months of this year. Net identifiable intangible assets have increased slightly as the impact of additional intangible assets recognized in connection with the previously referenced acquisitions were largely offset by $31 million of amortization expense during the year-to-date period. Total debt exclusive of operating lease liabilities is virtually unchanged since year end 2020. As a result of our consistent outstanding borrowings and the growth in our stockholders\u2019 equity due to our net income for the first six months of 2021, EMCOR\u2019s debt to capitalization ratio has reduced to 11.7% from 11.9% at the end of last year. EMCOR remains in a position of strength, which allows us to continue to invest in our business, return capital to shareholders and execute against our strategic objectives both in the near- and the long-term. With my portion of this morning\u2019s slide presentation complete, I would like to return the call to Tony. Tony?\nTony Guzzi: Hey. Thanks, Mark. And I am going to be on pages 12 to 13. I am going to talk about remaining performance obligations by segment and market sector. I\u2019ll give you a top summary here, they\u2019re at the highest level. However, we have a strong mix. Our bookings were strong for both small and large projects with a book-to-bill of 1.12. And what I am going to do is I am going to intermix comments from what would be page 13 and we\u2019ll talk about some of those sectors we\u2019ve been talking about into my overall RPO commentary. We sort of had a RPO triple-play here with RPOs increasing in three comparable periods. At the year period, that\u2019s versus 2020 for June 2021, June 2020, six-month period 2021 June versus December 2021 and sequentially from March 2021. All five of our business segments have RPO growth for each of these measurement periods. But to be fair, we\u2019ve said this many times, this is not a quarter-to-quarter or month-to-month business. RPO movement is not something we draw sweeping inclusions from month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter. But the reality is with the kind of bookings we had and level we\u2019re at, we feel pretty good about the forward view of our business. And I had a quarter one statement where I talked about the non-res market and I think I talked about it also as we moved through last year that we wouldn\u2019t know what the impact of that second quarter would be until we got to the second quarter. And I think we can now say that we expect growth in the non-residential market. I would guess that growth to sort of be somewhere in the mid-single digits and we\u2019re clearly outperforming that mid single-digit growth. As mentioned, total company RPOs at the end of the second quarter were just over $5.1 billion. They\u2019re up $516 million or 11.2%, when compared to the year ago level of $4.6 billion. They too increased $511 million for the first six months of the year and real important to look at is the organic RPO growth, which increased $409 million or 8.9%. And again, I talked about a book-to-bill well over 1. Our domestic construction segments had RPO growth in the quarter at $301 million since June 30, 2020 and that was both in the Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments. And we\u2019re seeing it being driven by strong overall bookings in data centers, manufacturing, industrial, water and waste water, healthcare and logistical infrastructure work. We also expect strength to continue in our small projects, short-duration work and a lot of that centers are on commercial and manufacturing is where we see that work. Building Services is 13% of total RPOs in the second quarter and increased $202 million, $114 million of that $202 million was organic. Pre-pandemic small project demand is active, it\u2019s back is another way of saying that across the country and we also getting more value now because of the indoor air quality and air movement work that we\u2019re doing in addition to the energy efficiency work. Our customers are executing both types of these projects as a result of an expectation of increased energy costs, a desire to reduce their carbon footprint and a strong belief that IAQ solutions will improve their employees\u2019 productivity by improving their ease of mind and their safety. One of the things I\u2019d point out is we are one of the key problem solvers for energy efficiency work and IAQ work, and as you demand more energy efficiency from your facility. We bring concepts from ideas and things that people think about to real projects for owners and tenants. We\u2019re uniquely positioned to help our customers reduce their carbon footprint, achieve cost reduction goals and have better and cleaner buildings. Every time we service, repair or replace an HVAC unit or install or service a new or updated building control systems and this is exactly where Mark told you we were growing in Building Services, we are making facilities, healthcare facilities, factories and office buildings less carbon intense and more efficient. The other thing we\u2019re seeing is the combination of these energy savings projects with more on-site generation, whether it be renewable generation like solar or combined heat and power, which takes waste heat and turns it into either HVAC or power generation. It is important to note that most of our Industrial Services segment field services work would not be in RPOs, as it is executed via time and material contracts. And in that case, we\u2019re seeing strong demand for us to schedule for people as we go from the back half of this year into next year. What we\u2019re seeing across the RPOs is we\u2019re winning at a rate that we believe is much faster than the underlying non-residential market growth and that we have durability to move within these sectors and flexibility and that will continue to benefit us as we move through the remainder of 2021 and into 2022. With that, I am now going to wrap up on pages 15 and 16. As we assess our performance at the half, we are performing very well across our business. And as a result of that performance through the first half of 2021, we\u2019re raising our earnings and revenue guidance for 2021. We will raise our revenue guidance to $9.5 million -- $905 billion in revenues, which exceeds our previous range of $9.2 billion to $9.4 billion in revenues. We will raise our earnings per diluted share guidance from $6.35 to $6.75 to a new range of $6.65 to $7.05. Previously, we had told you that we would know more at the conclusion of the second quarter and with greater visibility that we now have, we can raise our guidance. For us to achieve the middle to the top end of that guidance range, a large percentage of the following must happen. I think most of you know I like to talk about what we control and what we don\u2019t control. We would like to focus on the things we don\u2019t control and prepare contingency plans for those things that we don\u2019t control. So we focus on the things we control and have contingency plans for the things we don\u2019t control. What we control? Well, we like to think we control our cost and we\u2019re known for keeping our cost in check, whether that be direct and indirect labor costs, material costs. We\u2019re pretty good at this and it\u2019s been an operating fundamental here at EMCOR for a long time. We need to continue to have success in navigating the supply chain challenge with respect to pricing and availability. I talked about that earlier in my opening commentary. It\u2019s a challenge. I mean, I\u2019ve listened to a bunch of calls. You listen to more calls. It\u2019s a challenge. We\u2019re positioned well to navigate it. We think we\u2019ll continue navigating it well, but it is a challenge. We also need to continue to be able to find the right labor at the right time. We\u2019ve always been very successful at that. It\u2019s a question you all ask. I\u2019ll answer for you now. We expect to continue to be successful at that. We will always struggle to find HVAC technicians in the summer like everybody else and our op technicians and our operating engineers, we always are looking for, because we\u2019re growing that business pretty healthily right now. And so, those are the two areas, we always look for people. But we have great labor relations at the local level and we expect to be able to man our construction projects with the right people at the right time and the right skill mix. We are an employer of choice. We expect the booking momentum to continue, especially with respect to quick term project work, and for us, that means projects really less than $2.5 million or so. It\u2019s very strong right now. We expect that to continue and that\u2019s what gives us conviction to talk about the underlying strength in the market overall. I am humble enough and our team is humble enough to know that there\u2019s a whole bunch of things we don\u2019t control. We don\u2019t control whether the non-residential market will continue to be strong. We expect it to be. But if it\u2019s not, we will react and have a contingency plan to adapt to that. We don\u2019t control what will happen in industrial services. We know what we see with respect to what people want us to do. But we\u2019ve been doing this long enough to know that that can change. And look, we\u2019re a little shy about being overly optimistic, as what weather has done to us in the Gulf Coast over the last three years. We don\u2019t expect any major COVID disruptions in our business or our geographies. I do expect that there would be increased demand from our customers for us to supply vaccinated people and we are advocating that strongly in our business and for our employees. Safety is one of our key corporate values and we think keeping our employees safe is asking them to be vaccinated. We\u2019ve had pretty good success. We need to have better success. We also don\u2019t think the supply chain issues as of today will be more pronounced than they are, they could be. But we do expect them to last for the balance of the year, and clearly, we don\u2019t control everything that goes on with the supply chain. As far as capital allocation, we spent nearly $57 million on acquisitions year-to-date. They were right down the pipe as far as the kind of things that we like to do. We returned $138 million year-to-date on share repurchases as Mark talked about and we also returned $14.2 million in dividends back to our shareholders. We expect to continue to be balanced capital allocators as the year progresses and we have a decent pipeline of acquisitions that we are working on. I will tell you unequivocally right now that one of the strengths of our company is our balance sheet. Our customers look to that balance sheet. That\u2019s one of the reasons we can grow as fast as we can organically and it\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019ve had so much success on a lot of the quick term work in these large data center projects and healthcare projects because people know that we will have the working capital and the ability to build the team on a very quick basis with the right labor at the right time and have the access to the capital to do that. With all that being said, I am happy to take questions. Jerome, open the line please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Noelle Dilts with Stifel. Your line is open.\nNoelle Dilts: Hi, guys. Congrats on another good quarter.\nTony Guzzi: Hello, Noelle.\nNoelle Dilts: Good morning. So I was hoping you could just speak to the impact of raw material cost and inflation, I asked about this last quarter. And you talked about really making some major efforts to manage higher costs coming through. So could you just discuss where that stands today and the extent to which you\u2019ve been able to pass higher zero costs onto your customers?\nTony Guzzi: There\u2019s three ways that this gets mitigated, yeah, and how it works, right? The first one is, our longer term projects where we lock in the price especially for major end components or major commodities where we\u2019ve talked to distributors long before today. We\u2019re blessed to have good relationships. And businesses work together. I mean most pricing is protected on those large projects, because we\u2019re going to all work together through this period and we\u2019re all going to work together after this period of inflation. So there\u2019s a portion of our work that\u2019s protected. The next portion of our work is, you look at our composition of our company and you think about how much gets executed in short order, which is less than a year, which marks about two-thirds of what we do? So therefore, we\u2019re re-pricing that work all the time. We know today that we\u2019re in that environment. So there\u2019s two ways we\u2019ll mitigate that. We either lock it in for that 60 days or 90 days where we buy the material or we\u2019ll make it very clear to our customers that this is the component of what we couldn\u2019t buy that may fluctuate and your customers understand that. Now, if we\u2019re on a fixed price contract where they don\u2019t accept it, then we work extra hard to lock in the price. The third component of our work is time and material. Big chunk of the building services work, the small project work may not be time and material, but it\u2019s going to be executed in less than 60 days. It has a lot of the pricing characteristics of time and material work or it actually is time and material work and all of our industrial work which has very low material component, that\u2019s not purchased by the customer is time and material work. Mark, do you have anything to add on that?\nMark Pompa: No. I\u2019ll just edify what Tony said. When you look at our RPO in hand actually 84% is going to be executed in the next 12 months...\nTony Guzzi: Yeah. Little more\u2026\nMark Pompa: So it\u2019s actually more than two-thirds. So, clearly, our supply network has been stable for a long number of years, as you would imagine. EMCOR is a sizeable and important customer for those of us who were in that chain with a valued relationship on both ends and we\u2019re obviously working together to make this as the least painful it can be for all involved.\nTony Guzzi: Yeah. I think, Mark said -- he made a really important statement there and this is the CFO making the statement. We value both sides of that supply chain. So I like other large companies that we deal with at times. We don\u2019t take prepay discounts if we\u2019re not prepaying somebody or early paying somebody. We treat our suppliers the way we expect to be treated. And as a result of that, they tend to treat us fair in times like this. And we also have open communication. You think about a large distributor in a market, we may be, in many cases, their most important customer electrically and mechanically on what they\u2019re distributing. And we\u2019re the most important customer and you treat them right when times are maybe not as good as they were last year, they remember that now, just like we do. I mean, our best customers get our best labor and I think we get the best treatment from a lot of our suppliers, because our subsidiary CEOs deal very professionally with their suppliers at all times. That is how we conduct business. It\u2019s part of our corporate values. It\u2019s part of our code of conduct. It\u2019s how we treat people and it\u2019s how we expect to be treated.\nNoelle Dilts: Okay. Great. That was -- that\u2019s really helpful. Second question is a little bit more granular. But could you just expand upon the trends you\u2019re seeing in industrial services and one of the things we\u2019ve been watching is that with kind of a good operating environment for some of the refiners, strong crack spreads, et cetera, that they might delay some work. Just could you speak to what you\u2019re seeing there and how you\u2019re thinking about the outlook?\nTony Guzzi: I think they may, but they\u2019re not going to delay beyond first quarter of next year. We don\u2019t think and that\u2019s where we\u2019re really seeing what we\u2019re really calling the real inflection. Clearly, we think the comps will be better as you move through the back half of this year for a lot of reasons. But we do think that they\u2019re rebuilding, they\u2019re getting their planning. We know what we\u2019re planning. Again, they\u2019ll be better this year, next year. I don\u2019t think they plan on deferring maintenance forever.\nNoelle Dilts: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nSean Eastman: Hi, gentlemen.\nTony Guzzi: Good morning, Sean.\nMark Pompa: Good morning.\nSean Eastman: Good morning. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.\nTony Guzzi: Good morning.\nSean Eastman: So, book-to-bill above 1 times two quarters in a row now. I am just curious how you would characterize the kind of velocity there since the start of the year. Has bid activity continued to build momentum through the first half? And maybe put another way, would you expect to book more work in the second half than you did in the first half?\nTony Guzzi: I am always cautious to think of that especially thinking of the kind of booking we had in the first half.\nSean Eastman: Yeah.\nTony Guzzi: But I think you\u2019ve heard me say this before, Sean. Every decision of size that we\u2019re involved with is a binary decision. What scopes to find, we don\u2019t get -- it\u2019s not like an OEM that gets a share of the market typically. So we won the project or we didn\u2019t win the project. We won more than we thought we were going to win in the first half of the year and we won the right kind of work. Could that happen again in the second half of the year with more velocity? Sure it could. I don\u2019t necessarily think overall activity is necessarily stronger than we thought it was going to be. We\u2019re winning more of the right work and the kind of work we won than we thought in a typical year. Mark?\nMark Pompa: Yeah. Sean, the only thing I would add to Tony\u2019s comment is that and we\u2019re also seeing people making decisions now, right? Clearly, in the back half of 2020, there was a lot in front of us, a lot in front of our customers and most people hit the pause button for the obvious reasons. We\u2019re seeing more conviction in decision making certainly through the first six months of 2021. I mean we\u2019re cautiously optimistic that that trend is going to continue as we move through the rest of the year.\nTony Guzzi: Yeah. I think one of the wild cards is supply chain.\nSean Eastman: Yeah.\nTony Guzzi: I think there were more conviction around the supply chain right now. I think booking activity would even be stronger. I think there\u2019s two things that are sort of holding back things right now. One on the supply chain issues, which are real and I think they center on two things. One is resumption of capacity, right? Capacity is coming back online both in the U.S. and overseas. And the second thing is availability of labor. We talk to our suppliers. They\u2019re figuring out the first part I think now, getting the materials, and really steel mills have started coming and that\u2019s the one I think prices should start coming down and it really hasn\u2019t in a substantial way yet. But the real one is labor. It\u2019s very difficult to hire labor, just come in and re-staff a lot of the plants. So, therefore, they\u2019re not operating at the capacity they would like to operate at. And I\u2019ll give you a real example, right? When we talk to some of our suppliers, the way you typically hire in the manufacturing environment, although we don\u2019t really do that, but the way you typically hire in a manufacturing environment, you would typically bring people in either seasonally or for a 60-day trial period. That 60-day trial period would typically be through a temp agency and really what you\u2019re trying to make sure is if the person show up to work, can we train them on the skills and can they pass the drug test? I mean, just to be very straight, that\u2019s what they\u2019re looking for. And then after 60 days people typically would get a pretty substantial raise. So they may have brought them in at $12 or $13 an hour and then raise them to $15, $18 an hour once they became full time. That whole first step isn\u2019t happening right now. And so, as a result, you\u2019re getting more churn in the permanent workforce, if they can find it and venture to say, I think, a big chunk of the manufacturing capacity that we draw from is probably still yet somewhere between 6% and 10% understaffed versus where they would like to be.\nSean Eastman: Okay. That\u2019s interesting, Tony. That\u2019s helpful as we think about the swings into the second half. And my second question is, we talk about the non-res market growth and the construction segments are clearly poised to sort of outperform that broader non-res growth. But I wanted to kind of drill down on Building Services. Considering we\u2019ve got some seemingly pretty durable secular drivers there around energy efficiency, IAQ, et cetera, I mean, what\u2019s the growth rate in the services piece of the business, if that makes sense?\nTony Guzzi: Yeah. I mean, so you see what\u2019s going to go on with the project bookings. I mean, they\u2019re a little larger than they typically are, so the timing will be a little longer. So they may go into next year some of them. You\u2019re talking 20% plus organic growth in bookings. Underlying service growth is very strong. It\u2019s high single digits or will be and it should be through the summer. What\u2019s restraining that segment\u2019s growth right now is somewhat what\u2019s going on with the government business right now and it\u2019s nothing that we are terribly worried about, but it\u2019s slow award, slow decision making. Pretty much, Mark and I talk about it, we can pretty much play the playbook based on when the administration is changed and now it even happens at mid-term elections, so depending on what happens with Congress. So that\u2019s what sort of slowing things down. Good growth in commercial site, good growth in repair service, good growth in service agreements, good growth in controls, very strong growth in projects. So you are right to point out and we have a great team that anticipates those needs and did all the training they needed to do to have people ready. But you\u2019re right to point out there are some very good secular trends that we\u2019re benefiting from. Those trends also happen in the Mechanical Construction business, a portion of the revenues, Mark, what 15%, 20% of their revenues...\nMark Pompa: Yeah.\nTony Guzzi: ... is also service and small projects. Do you have anything to add to that?\nMark Pompa: No. Nothing to add.\nTony Guzzi: Okay.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Thanks a lot, gents. I\u2019ll turn it over there.\nTony Guzzi: Thank you.\nMark Pompa: Great.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Your line is open.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey. Good morning, guys. Congrats on a great quarter.\nTony Guzzi: Good morning, Adam.\nTony Guzzi: Thank you.\nAdam Thalhimer: Can you -- I guess I wanted to ask first on the revenue guidance, because that would imply I would have to bring down the back half a little bit, within the segments where are you possibly seeing a little bit of weakness where I could bring that down?\nTony Guzzi: What -- we don\u2019t do your modeling. So we look at the first half. We\u2019re expecting as good or better second half as the first half. But the wild card being what might happen in Industrial. So I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re thinking about the other parts, but that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about the world in general.\nAdam Thalhimer: Do you see Industrial revenue being similar to the first half?\nTony Guzzi: I don\u2019t -- I think it should be better. But again we\u2019re cautiously optimistic and with an emphasis on the word cautiously.\nAdam Thalhimer: And then, within Building Services, was there any unusual that flowed through in Q2, I know you talked about that mix issue?\nTony Guzzi: No. Nothing unusual.\nAdam Thalhimer: No. So $624 million is kind of a decent base for the back half?\nTony Guzzi: 6.4, what?\nAdam Thalhimer: No. No. I am sorry. $600 -- the quarterly revenue there was $625 million. I just didn\u2019t know if that...\nTony Guzzi: Yeah. Adam, we don\u2019t do quarterly revenue and operating income guidance, you know that.\nAdam Thalhimer: How are clients responding to materials prices?\nTony Guzzi: I think they\u2019re pragmatic, you\u2019re reading it in the newspaper every day. Do they want the project done or not. We\u2019re being straight up with them, right? We tell them what we know. They\u2019re hearing it everywhere. So, their reacting is, I wouldn\u2019t say, it\u2019s shock and disappointment. The same characters, they would never want to pay for it. They don\u2019t want to pay for anything now and the ones that work with us and the ones we\u2019re working with. This is the time for us to be customer selective of where we are.\nAdam Thalhimer: And then, Mark, any thoughts on back half cash flow, is it better than the first half?\nMark Pompa: Yeah. I mean, in my commentary, Adam, I specified that we\u2019re expecting full year operating cash flow to be in excess of $300 million. So, obviously, we\u2019re negative $6 million or $7 million through the first half. So you could force that math.\nAdam Thalhimer: Got it. And then, Tony, you brought up the acquisition pipeline, can you give a little more color?\nTony Guzzi: Yeah. Sure. I mean, we\u2019ve closed some deals here today. We have a couple more that we expect to close here in the near-term. They\u2019re either geographic expansions or product line expansions. And they\u2019ve been different sizes. There are things that can be standalone and help us grow market or they\u2019re very niche things that we attach to existing operations. The pipeline is strong. What we are learning is some companies that thought they were ready to sell, post-pandemic maybe weren\u2019t quite ready to sell. They need six months maybe to get things ready to sell. But again, I think, I pointed out on the slide, we did about $0.5 billion of deal from 2018 till first quarter. There\u2019s no reason for me to believe it won\u2019t be at least that or more as we go through the next three years. As I\u2019ve always said, deals happen when they happen. They\u2019re episodic. I feel better about the acquisition teams we have in place now than I ever have. I feel better about the due diligence we do now than I ever have. Deals might take longer now, right? There\u2019s other things you have to think about. You have to make sure you\u2019re doing good cyber due diligence and the targets clearly know that. You have to make sure you\u2019re doing good due diligence around what you really think happened to their demand in the pandemic and what\u2019s coming back. I think again the people we\u2019re working with to buy know that also. And then, of course, you\u2019ve heard me whine consistently for any number of years now about multiples and private equity multiples. I am not going to do that anymore, because -- for me as a Pittsburgh Steeler fan, it\u2019s sort of like the New England Patriots beat us, they beat us, that\u2019s life. I am not sure they\u2019re beating us in long-term value creation. But all you have to do to win an acquisition is pay more in some cases and that\u2019s usually not the best acquisition for us. The best acquisition for us is some of the terrific people that have become part of our EMCOR team over the last number of years. I can go all the way back to when we bought S.A. Comunale in 2006 and Steve Comunale still proudly runs that company or Shambaugh that came with Comfort Systems and Mark Shambaugh running it and now Paul Meyers is a terrific operator with. And they take pride in what they do and they\u2019re building that business for the long-term and the work that Rob Vincent has done in fire protection or the team that came with R&R Mechanical and how Vincent sold his life\u2019s work to us and he is still in there every day swinging away and part of the team. And those are the best acquisitions for EMCOR. We see no shortage in the pipeline of people who really care about their business, their people and want a fair return on their life\u2019s work, but still want to work. And so I\u2019ll stick to what we do in the long-term value creation we have and not get crazy and try to compete with people that have a different view of the world and use leverage and slides and triangles and all that stuff to explain the business. I\u2019ll stick to what we know how to do.\nAdam Thalhimer: Good strategy. Thanks, Tony. Thanks, Mark.\nTony Guzzi: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nTony Guzzi: Good morning, Brent.\nBrent Thielman: Hey. Thank you. Hey, good morning. Congrats again...\nTony Guzzi: Thank you.\nBrent Thielman: ...on another great quarter. Hey. Tony, I mean, more than 20% growth this quarter, you had some unique circumstances last year, but that\u2019s pretty notable growth. I think one of the things that comes to mind is, all the supply chain logistical pressures that have been brought up, assuming it affects everyone in the industry. And I guess, what I am wondering is, do you think you\u2019re gaining some share in light of that in some of these local geographies, just because you have this more sophisticated platform and so better equipped to manage that?\nTony Guzzi: What I think is we\u2019re winning more projects. I don\u2019t ever think about share. So, yeah, I guess, we\u2019re winning more share. But the way I think about it, are we winning more of the projects that we\u2019re targeting? The answer to that is, yes. And I think we\u2019re winning more of those projects for three reasons. It starts with technical excellence, right? We got the best folks and we can do it safely and we do it right and we\u2019re going to be there to make sure that that product commissions the right way. And then, on the service side, we\u2019re going to bring some of the best technical resources to get buildings back up and running or to get that energy efficiency done, reduce people\u2019s carbon footprint and now bring an IAQ solution in with it, and Mike Bordes, and the team in energy services. Then I think it gets to the people on our segment level, Joe Burns and Dan Fitzgibbons, they\u2019ve invigorated the teams. We had great teams to begin with and they\u2019ve invigorated them to look at this market and look at that which you just said as an opportunity. We are more sophisticated. And we also, people know that we can bring the labor to bear and we can a lot of times get the best labor to bear. We have some of the best foremen and superintendents in the industry. They then interact some of the best labor in the industry. And I would now -- and just follow with what I think is often overlooked. When you\u2019re going to do a data center project that may be a hyperscale project, that\u2019s a 50-megawatt, a 75-megawatt project and you\u2019re going to burn $80 million of cost in nine months or less, you better have the liquidity and balance sheet to do that. And more and more customers are looking at our balance sheet and looking at our liquidity and looking at our ability to execute the other two things. And say, yeah, these guys could make that happen and they manage this business very conservatively and they manage it appropriately for the kind of contractors that they are. And I have great faith that the EMCOR folks will bring it to bear, and I\u2019d add another thing, our folks are working better together through their peer learning and sharing of resources and ideas across our company than any time in my 17 years here.\nBrent Thielman: Hey. Tony, do you think that\u2019s applicable to Industrial Services as well, because I know the environment is still not good, but your margins are up a little bit there, it seems like there\u2019s\u2026\nTony Guzzi: You know.\nBrent Thielman: \u2026 better growth in field services off. I wonder if that\u2019s playing out there, too.\nTony Guzzi: Bad markets prove whether you have a good team or not. We have a great team. They\u2019ve been operate -- they\u2019re operating near breakeven on an operating income basis, generating positive EBITDA. Mark, cash is, okay, right, tough market. I think, yes, the same applies there.\nBrent Thielman: Yeah. And I guess, I tended to think of materials at least, historically, and generally, a pass-through for you guys, right or wrong, but most of the costs just lie on the people, right?\nTony Guzzi: Yeah.\nBrent Thielman: And so, I guess, what I am asking here, Tony, is how constraining is this rise in materials prices to margins now or potentially into the second half, because if that\u2019s the case, I know your gross profit dollars should grow, but is it really meaningful enough to potentially weigh on margins for new jobs you add?\nTony Guzzi: No. No. It might be a short-term dislocation on one project or two projects. And look, we may choose to do that. Because it\u2019s just like we talk about how our suppliers protect us. On the right projects we would protect our customers. That\u2019s life and we\u2019re not going to blow up our long-term relationship because of that if we think, hey, the customer did everything right here, we need to make this right. That doesn\u2019t typically happen on the large projects, but the smaller stuff we may do that. The second thing is what is constraining is potentially new starts? We haven\u2019t seen that yet. We might. But I\u2019d give you a flip side of the argument that is likely to happen I think. We talked a lot about re-shoring and on-shoring of manufacturing capacity. I think this whole supply chain issue is actually an opportunity for us long-term. The long-term meaning the next two years to five years as more people look at creating flexibility in their factories and making them less labor dependent after what they\u2019ve experienced over the last six months and more things come onshore. The trade relations are getting better with China. The situation is not anymore improved to Mexico. One of the things I know we talk to our customers is, we got collectively in industrial American a bad habit. We always thought about our most important products being dual sourced. At least dual sourced from a facility standpoint. It might be with the same supplier, but the supplier we expected to have dual facilities. We got away from that the last 10 years and we see that coming back pretty substantially right now across the Board.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. Maybe the last one and I hate to speculate too much on markets, but I don\u2019t think I realize how fast your healthcare related business is coming back both in Electrical and Mechanical. I guess, I am just curious to your thoughts whether that\u2019s cyclical secular catch-up from last year\u2019s kind of softness. What are your thoughts there?\nTony Guzzi: It\u2019s cyclical secular. Does that make sense?\nBrent Thielman: All of the above.\nTony Guzzi: There\u2019s good long-term secular trends but we think it\u2019s going into a pretty good cycle right now.\nBrent Thielman: Yeah. Looks sustainable. Okay. All right. Thank you very much.\nTony Guzzi: Thank you. Is that it?\nOperator: All right. With no further question at this time, I\u2019ll hand the call back to the company.\nTony Guzzi: Hey. Look, thank you all for listening. We did have a very good quarter. Our folks are doing a lot of the right things and I know I am thankful to be surrounded by such great teammates every day and we\u2019re very aware of how hard the work is in the field. And I have a lot of passion on this subject about how we take care of our people. And I employ anybody that\u2019s listening from EMCOR to everything you can to encourage vaccinations, so we can start to put this pandemic behind us. One of our core values is safety and I look at this as squarely in the middle of that core value. With that, I\u2019ll leave you. Thank you and talk to you over the next couple of months. Bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Pompa",
            "content": "Thank you, Tony, and good morning to everyone participating on our call today. For those accessing this presentation via the webcast we are now on slide seven. Over the next several slides, I will supplement Tony's opening commentary on EMCOR's second quarter performance, as well as provide a brief update on our year-to-date results through June 30th. All financial information referenced this morning is derived from our consolidated financial statements, included in both our earnings release announcement and Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier today. So, let's revisit and expand our review of EMCOR's second quarter performance. Consolidated revenues of $2.44 billion are up $423.6 million or 21% over quarter two 2020. Our second quarter results included $53.8 million of revenues attributable to businesses acquired pertaining to the time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in last year's second quarter. Acquisition revenues positively impacted both our United States Electrical Construction and United States Building Services segments. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired, second quarter revenues increased nearly $370 million or 18.4% when compared to the second quarter of 2020, which was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the corresponding containment and mitigation measures mandated by certain of our customers, as well as numerous governmental authorities. Despite the less than difficult compare between quarterly periods due to the challenging environment in 2020, EMCOR's quarter two 2021 revenues represent an all-time quarterly revenue record for the company. The specifics to each of our reportable segments are as follows. United States Electrical Construction segment revenues of $489.5 million increased $79.1 million or 19.3% from 2020 second quarter. Excluding acquisition revenues of $8.6 million, the segment's revenues increased 17.2% quarter-over-quarter. Significant increases in revenue contribution from projects within the commercial, institutional and healthcare market sectors were the primary drivers of the period-over-period improvement. We continue to see strength in the telecommunication submarket sector, as we experience sustained customer demand for data center projects driving the growth in commercial market sector activity within the segment. United States Mechanical Construction segment revenues of $958.7 million, increased $168.2 million or 21.3% from quarter two last year. Revenue growth was primarily attributable to an increase in commercial and healthcare market sector activities. With respect to the commercial market sector, consistent with the growth experienced by our Electrical Construction segment, this segment also continues to see strong demand for data center project work, given growth in data storage and cloud computing across the country. In addition, the continued build-out of our customers' e-commerce supply chains has resulted in an increase in the number of fire protection project opportunities for this segment within various warehousing and distribution facilities. With regard to the healthcare market sector, consistent with the trends we experienced during the first quarter of this year, we are engaged in a number of projects ranging from mechanical system retrofits to complete installations in both new and existing healthcare facilities. Second quarter revenues for EMCOR's combined United States Construction business of $1.45 billion increased $247.3 million or 20.6%. This revenue performance represents an all-time high for our combined Construction segments. Despite this record revenue performance, we increased remaining performance obligations, which Tony briefly covered, within each of these segments as a result of strong project bookings. Tony will cover this in more detail at the completion of my prepared remarks. United States Building Services quarterly revenues of $624.4 million increased $145.5 million or 30.4%. Excluding acquisition revenues in this segment of $45.2 million, the segment's revenues increased almost 21% organically. This performance also represents an all-time quarterly record for the segment's revenues. Revenue gains within each of their divisions due to resumption of maintenance and project activity as compared to 2020's COVID impacted quarter, augmented by incremental projects aimed at improving customers' indoor air quality, as well as increased building automation and controls activity were the primary drivers of this quarter's strong revenue performance. EMCOR's Industrial Services segment revenues of $235.2 million decreased $5.9 million or 2.5% as the segment has yet to return to pre-pandemic revenue levels due to prolonged adverse market conditions within the oil and gas and related industries. Of those still below the prior year, this 2.5% quarter-over-quarter revenue reduction is significantly less than the more abrupt quarterly revenue declines experienced in other quarters post-quarter one of 2020. As Tony previously indicated, we are beginning to see positive signs of demand returning as we look toward -- our turnaround planning for early 2022. Let's hope that we do not see any additional macroeconomic headwinds impacting this industry. United Kingdom Building Services revenues of $129.9 million increased $36.7 million or 39.5% from last year's quarter. Resumption of maintenance contract activity that began during quarter one of this year strengthened in quarter two as project work that was deferred in 2020 has recommenced. Additionally, revenues of this segment benefited from $14.5 million of favorable exchange rate movement during the period. Please turn to slide eight. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $242.9 million represent 10% of revenues and reflect an increase of $37.7 million from quarter two 2020. Adjusting for incremental expenses attributable to companies acquired, inclusive of intangible asset amortization, EMCOR's organic SG&A increase was $33.4 million. As a reminder, the prior year period benefited from substantial cost reductions resulting from actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with significant percentage of such actions pertain to employment costs including furloughs, headcount reductions and temporary salary reductions. Additionally, 2020 second quarter included reduced levels of incentive compensation expense, as a result of the downward recalibration of our internal forecasts, driven by the uncertainty created by the pandemic. In contrast, the results for the second quarter of 2021 include a significant growth in revenues, as well as profitability forecasts, which eclipse EMCOR's previous earnings performance records across numerous of our operating companies. These factors have necessitated headcount additions to support such growth, as well as increased levels of quarterly incentive compensation accruals. Just so that there is no misunderstanding, at this time last year, we were either reversing the previous quarter's incentive accruals or accruing at significantly reduced rates, while at this point in 2021, based on our performance for the first six months of the year and our projections for the remainder of the year, our incentive compensation levels are tracking more linear with our current year earnings expectations. In addition to these increases in employment costs, our results for the second quarter of 2021 included a $4.1 million provision for credit losses due to the bankruptcy filing of a customer within our U.S. Industrial Services segment, which negatively impacted our quarterly consolidated SG&A margin by 20 basis points. Reported operating income for the quarter of $133.4 million, compares to an operating loss of $122.6 million in 2020 second quarter, due to the $232.8 million non-cash impairment charge recorded in the prior year. Excluding 2020's impairment charge, operating income for the current period represents a $23.2 million or 21.1% improvement over last year's adjusted non-GAAP second quarter operating income of $110.1 million. For the second quarter of 2021, operating margin represents 5.5% of revenues and is consistent with our adjusted non-GAAP operating margin in last year's quarter. Consistent with our quarterly revenue performance, the operating income of each of our reportable segments other than U.S. Industrial Services has increased by double-digit percentages. Specific quarterly operating performance by reporting segment is as follows. Operating income of our U.S. Electrical Construction Services segment of $42.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2021 increased by $11.1 million from the comparable 2020 period. Reported operating margin of 8.7% represents 100-basis-point improvement over last year's second quarter due to an improvement in gross profit margin given a more favorable revenue mix and continued strong project execution. Second quarter operating income of our U.S. Mechanical Construction Services segment of $79.3 million increased $12.3 million from the comparable 2020 period. Reported operating margin of 8.3% represents a slight reduction from last year's quarter. Our over 20% increase in quarterly revenues was the major driver of our period-over-period operating income improvement, while the slight reduction in operating margin resulted from a modest decrease in gross profit margin due to the composition of work performed during each period. Each of our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments established new second quarter records in terms of operating income dollars. Our total U.S. Construction business is reporting $122 million of operating income and 8.4% operating margin. This performance is improved by $23.4 million and 20 basis points from last year's second quarter. Operating income for U.S. Building Services is $30.3 million or 4.9% of revenues. This represents a $3.7 million improvement quarter-over-quarter and like most of our other reporting segments represents a new second quarter record for operating income dollars. Increased gross profit from the mechanical services and commercial-site-based services divisions due to a strong resumption in demand as compared to 2020's challenging second quarter was the primary reason for the period-over-period increase in operating income. The 70-basis-point reduction in quarterly operating margin is due to revenue mix, which included a larger percentage of fixed price capital projects that traditionally have a lower gross profit margin profile than the segment's call-out service work. Our U.S. Industrial Services segment operating loss of approximately $200,000 represents a decrease of $3.5 million from last year's second quarter operating income of $3.3 million. While the segment experienced an increase in gross profit and gross profit margin during the current quarter, its results include an increase in credit losses due to the aforementioned customer bankruptcy, which negatively impacted operating income by $4.1 million and operating margin of the segment by 180 basis points. Looking ahead, we are encouraged as we are beginning to see signs of improving financial performance albeit in an environment that remains somewhat challenged. U.K. Building Services operating income of $7 million or 5.4% of revenues represents an improvement of $1.7 million with a slight reduction in operating margin over 2020 second quarter. Approximately $800,000 of this period-over-period improvement is due to positive foreign exchange movement with the remainder attributable to an increase in project activity primarily within the commercial market sector. The decrease in quarterly operating margin is a result of an increase in the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to revenues in the current quarter, as the prior year benefited from certain short-term cost-cutting initiatives and actually in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are now on slide nine. Additional financial items of significance for the quarter not addressed on my previous slides are as follows. Quarter two gross profit of $376.3 million, was higher than 2020's comparable quarter by $61 million or 19.3%. Gross margin of 15.4% is 30 basis points lower than last year's quarter due to shifts in revenue mix in both our U.S. Mechanical Construction and U.S. Building Services segment within the quarter. Diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of 2021 is $1.78, as compared to a loss per diluted share of $1.52 in the year ago period. On an adjusted basis after adding back the impairment loss on goodwill, identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets recorded last year, 2020's non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.44. When compared to our current years -- when compared to our current quarter's performance, we're reporting a $0.34 or 23.6% quarter-over-quarter EPS improvement. This 2021 quarterly diluted EPS of $1.78 represents a new all-time record for any quarterly period in our history, despite some of the headwinds we continue to face. This is further testimony to the operational excellence demonstrated by our subsidiary and segment teams each and every day for which I am thankful. Please turn to slide 10. With the quarterly commentary complete, I will touch on some high level highlights with respect to EMCOR's results for the first six months of 2021. Revenues of $4.74 billion represent an increase of $427.9 million or 9.9%. Operating income of $250.4 million or 5.3% of revenues represent sizeable increases from both 2020's reported and as adjusted non-GAAP six-month results. Year-to-date diluted earnings per share was $3.32. Although not shown on the slide, my last comment on the results for the first six-month period is with respect to our slightly negative operating cash flow as compared to 2020 strong cash flow performance during the first half of the year. With substantial organic revenue growth in this year's second quarter, we have experienced an increase in working capital investment as both our accounts receivable and contract asset balances have elevated in concert with our project and service volumes. Further, it is important to note that our cash flow for the prior year period was favorably impacted by certain government legislation passed in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, which allowed for the deferral of the employer's portion of social security taxes throughout the majority of 2020 and also extended the deadline for making estimated federal tax payments from the second to third quarter of last year. These measures, along with the United Kingdom's deferral of value-added tax in the prior year favorably impacted both our second quarter and six-month operating cash flows in 2020 by almost $100 million. My expectation for full year 2021 is that we will generate operating cash flow in excess of $300 million. Please turn to slide 11. EMCOR's balance sheet remains strong and liquid. Cash on hand is down from year end 2020 driven by cash used in financing activities of approximately $157 million, inclusive of $138 million used for the repurchase of our common stock and cash used in investing activities of approximately $71 million, most notably due to payments for acquisitions net of cash acquired totaling just shy of $56 million. Working capital levels have increased modestly as increases in accounts receivable and contract assets, resulting from our substantial organic growth during the period, were offset by the decrease in our cash balance just referenced. The increase in goodwill is predominantly a result of the three businesses acquired during the first six months of this year. Net identifiable intangible assets have increased slightly as the impact of additional intangible assets recognized in connection with the previously referenced acquisitions were largely offset by $31 million of amortization expense during the year-to-date period. Total debt exclusive of operating lease liabilities is virtually unchanged since year end 2020. As a result of our consistent outstanding borrowings and the growth in our stockholders' equity due to our net income for the first six months of 2021, EMCOR's debt to capitalization ratio has reduced to 11.7% from 11.9% at the end of last year. EMCOR remains in a position of strength, which allows us to continue to invest in our business, return capital to shareholders and execute against our strategic objectives both in the near- and the long-term. With my portion of this morning's slide presentation complete, I would like to return the call to Tony. Tony? No. I'll just edify what Tony said. When you look at our RPO in hand actually 84% is going to be executed in the next 12 months... So it's actually more than two-thirds. So, clearly, our supply network has been stable for a long number of years, as you would imagine. EMCOR is a sizeable and important customer for those of us who were in that chain with a valued relationship on both ends and we're obviously working together to make this as the least painful it can be for all involved. Good morning. Yeah. Sean, the only thing I would add to Tony's comment is that and we're also seeing people making decisions now, right? Clearly, in the back half of 2020, there was a lot in front of us, a lot in front of our customers and most people hit the pause button for the obvious reasons. We're seeing more conviction in decision making certainly through the first six months of 2021. I mean we're cautiously optimistic that that trend is going to continue as we move through the rest of the year. Yeah. No. Nothing to add. Great. Yeah. I mean, in my commentary, Adam, I specified that we're expecting full year operating cash flow to be in excess of $300 million. So, obviously, we're negative $6 million or $7 million through the first half. So you could force that math."

            "name": "Tony Guzzi",
            "content": "Yeah. Thanks, Kevin, and good morning to everybody. And upfront here, I am going to be covering pages four to six. And you take a step back, what a difference a year makes? When we reported our second quarter 2020 numbers, we were in the throes of a pandemic with no clear end in sight. Although, COVID-19 cases in some geographies are rising again. We are in a much more stable environment and have much better visibility with respect to our operations than a year ago. We remain focused on our employee safety as we continue to work in this environment. We had a very strong operating quarter, with revenues of $2.44 billion, operating income of $133 million and earnings per diluted share of $1.78. We maintained strong operating income margins of 5.5% and had revenue growth of 21% overall, with 18% organic revenue growth. It is important to remember that in second quarter 2020 we had several of our key geographic markets either shutdown or partially shutdown. This revenue growth resulted in a sizeable investment in working capital this quarter, leading to a more typical cash flow pattern for us than in the prior year, during which we were liquidating our balance sheet due to COVID-19 imposed lockdowns and customer site restrictions. Regardless of the unusual factors impacting our comparison against last year, we had a very strong quarter. Our business trends are strong. We grew our remaining performance obligations, and I'll refer to them as RPOs for the rest of the presentation to a record $5.1 billion and had substantial growth in our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments, as well as in our Building Services segment. This RPO growth was broad based across market sectors and geographies. For the quarter, we continued to see excellent operational execution in both our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments. We had revenue growth in our Electrical Construction segment of 19.3% and in our Mechanical segment up 21.3%, which I believe reflects more than just resumption of normal demand from the COVID impacted results of the second quarter last year. With Mechanical Construction operating income margins of 8.3% and Electrical Construction operating income margins of 8.7%, we are executing with discipline and precision as we grow our business. We had broad based growth across our trade offerings and market sectors, and across our geographic footprint. We had especially strong growth within the commercial and that's really across commercial with data centers and logistical infrastructure drove that, and healthcare market sectors. Our large project work and small quick term project work are both strong from a revenue and booking perspective. We continue to work very hard to bid and schedule our work amid the uncertainty around material pricing and availability. Our team is experienced with this issue and so far we have weathered this challenge. But it requires attention to detail, communication with our supply chain partners and customers, thoughtful planning, and careful contract negotiations. The supply chain pressures are likely to be with us for most of the balance of the year. Again, I sound redundant, but we are blessed with an execution-oriented culture across EMCOR. Our Electrical and Mechanical Construction teams are some of the best operators in the business. We leave the quarter with very strong RPO growth across these segments of almost 8% from the year ago period and nearly 10% from the end of 2020 and this is despite very strong revenue growth. Our U.S. Building Services segment had a very strong quarter, with revenue growth of 30.4% and operating income growth of 13.9%. Operating income margins were strong at 4.9%. RPOs additionally increased 37.8% versus the year ago period, and organically, RPOs are up 21.2%. We see accelerating demand for HVAC retrofit projects with a special emphasis on energy retrofit and IAQ or indoor air quality. We're also performing very well in our commercial site-based business with strong bookings year-to-date and several important customer wins. We are not only executing for our current customers, but are winning new work and have a very healthy pipeline of opportunities in this business. We expect to continue to see strong demand for our mechanical services, as well as our commercial site-based business services as customers seek to improve their facilities as they emerge from the pandemic. Our Building Services team has done an exceptional job of anticipating our customers' needs post-pandemic and we are a key partner in making these facilities more energy efficient and safer with improved air quality and movement. In our Industrial Services segment, we had a near breakeven performance on an operating income basis, despite taking a $4 million charge for a receivable from a customer who recently entered into bankruptcy protection. We had positive EBITDA and I believe we will start seeing better revenue comparisons as we move through the second half of 2021. We do expect our forward view to improve as customer inquiries and scheduling are at very robust levels for late 2021 and early 2022, crack spreads remain strong and utilization continues to improve. Our U.K. Building Services segment had another strong quarter, with operating income growth of 31.7%. We continue to execute well for our customers in the U.K. and have strong retrofit project growth and also for our full facilities management offering. Overall, a very strong quarter and we remain poised to deliver for our customers and shareholders for the remainder of 2021. We've had a great start to the year and I would be remiss if I didn't thank our employees for their focus on safety first, while delivering results for our customers and shareowners in an ever changing environment. With that, I will turn the discussion over to Mark. Hey. Thanks, Mark. And I am going to be on pages 12 to 13. I am going to talk about remaining performance obligations by segment and market sector. I'll give you a top summary here, they're at the highest level. However, we have a strong mix. Our bookings were strong for both small and large projects with a book-to-bill of 1.12. And what I am going to do is I am going to intermix comments from what would be page 13 and we'll talk about some of those sectors we've been talking about into my overall RPO commentary. We sort of had a RPO triple-play here with RPOs increasing in three comparable periods. At the year period, that's versus 2020 for June 2021, June 2020, six-month period 2021 June versus December 2021 and sequentially from March 2021. All five of our business segments have RPO growth for each of these measurement periods. But to be fair, we've said this many times, this is not a quarter-to-quarter or month-to-month business. RPO movement is not something we draw sweeping inclusions from month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter. But the reality is with the kind of bookings we had and level we're at, we feel pretty good about the forward view of our business. And I had a quarter one statement where I talked about the non-res market and I think I talked about it also as we moved through last year that we wouldn't know what the impact of that second quarter would be until we got to the second quarter. And I think we can now say that we expect growth in the non-residential market. I would guess that growth to sort of be somewhere in the mid-single digits and we're clearly outperforming that mid single-digit growth. As mentioned, total company RPOs at the end of the second quarter were just over $5.1 billion. They're up $516 million or 11.2%, when compared to the year ago level of $4.6 billion. They too increased $511 million for the first six months of the year and real important to look at is the organic RPO growth, which increased $409 million or 8.9%. And again, I talked about a book-to-bill well over 1. Our domestic construction segments had RPO growth in the quarter at $301 million since June 30, 2020 and that was both in the Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments. And we're seeing it being driven by strong overall bookings in data centers, manufacturing, industrial, water and waste water, healthcare and logistical infrastructure work. We also expect strength to continue in our small projects, short-duration work and a lot of that centers are on commercial and manufacturing is where we see that work. Building Services is 13% of total RPOs in the second quarter and increased $202 million, $114 million of that $202 million was organic. Pre-pandemic small project demand is active, it's back is another way of saying that across the country and we also getting more value now because of the indoor air quality and air movement work that we're doing in addition to the energy efficiency work. Our customers are executing both types of these projects as a result of an expectation of increased energy costs, a desire to reduce their carbon footprint and a strong belief that IAQ solutions will improve their employees' productivity by improving their ease of mind and their safety. One of the things I'd point out is we are one of the key problem solvers for energy efficiency work and IAQ work, and as you demand more energy efficiency from your facility. We bring concepts from ideas and things that people think about to real projects for owners and tenants. We're uniquely positioned to help our customers reduce their carbon footprint, achieve cost reduction goals and have better and cleaner buildings. Every time we service, repair or replace an HVAC unit or install or service a new or updated building control systems and this is exactly where Mark told you we were growing in Building Services, we are making facilities, healthcare facilities, factories and office buildings less carbon intense and more efficient. The other thing we're seeing is the combination of these energy savings projects with more on-site generation, whether it be renewable generation like solar or combined heat and power, which takes waste heat and turns it into either HVAC or power generation. It is important to note that most of our Industrial Services segment field services work would not be in RPOs, as it is executed via time and material contracts. And in that case, we're seeing strong demand for us to schedule for people as we go from the back half of this year into next year. What we're seeing across the RPOs is we're winning at a rate that we believe is much faster than the underlying non-residential market growth and that we have durability to move within these sectors and flexibility and that will continue to benefit us as we move through the remainder of 2021 and into 2022. With that, I am now going to wrap up on pages 15 and 16. As we assess our performance at the half, we are performing very well across our business. And as a result of that performance through the first half of 2021, we're raising our earnings and revenue guidance for 2021. We will raise our revenue guidance to $9.5 million -- $905 billion in revenues, which exceeds our previous range of $9.2 billion to $9.4 billion in revenues. We will raise our earnings per diluted share guidance from $6.35 to $6.75 to a new range of $6.65 to $7.05. Previously, we had told you that we would know more at the conclusion of the second quarter and with greater visibility that we now have, we can raise our guidance. For us to achieve the middle to the top end of that guidance range, a large percentage of the following must happen. I think most of you know I like to talk about what we control and what we don't control. We would like to focus on the things we don't control and prepare contingency plans for those things that we don't control. So we focus on the things we control and have contingency plans for the things we don't control. What we control? Well, we like to think we control our cost and we're known for keeping our cost in check, whether that be direct and indirect labor costs, material costs. We're pretty good at this and it's been an operating fundamental here at EMCOR for a long time. We need to continue to have success in navigating the supply chain challenge with respect to pricing and availability. I talked about that earlier in my opening commentary. It's a challenge. I mean, I've listened to a bunch of calls. You listen to more calls. It's a challenge. We're positioned well to navigate it. We think we'll continue navigating it well, but it is a challenge. We also need to continue to be able to find the right labor at the right time. We've always been very successful at that. It's a question you all ask. I'll answer for you now. We expect to continue to be successful at that. We will always struggle to find HVAC technicians in the summer like everybody else and our op technicians and our operating engineers, we always are looking for, because we're growing that business pretty healthily right now. And so, those are the two areas, we always look for people. But we have great labor relations at the local level and we expect to be able to man our construction projects with the right people at the right time and the right skill mix. We are an employer of choice. We expect the booking momentum to continue, especially with respect to quick term project work, and for us, that means projects really less than $2.5 million or so. It's very strong right now. We expect that to continue and that's what gives us conviction to talk about the underlying strength in the market overall. I am humble enough and our team is humble enough to know that there's a whole bunch of things we don't control. We don't control whether the non-residential market will continue to be strong. We expect it to be. But if it's not, we will react and have a contingency plan to adapt to that. We don't control what will happen in industrial services. We know what we see with respect to what people want us to do. But we've been doing this long enough to know that that can change. And look, we're a little shy about being overly optimistic, as what weather has done to us in the Gulf Coast over the last three years. We don't expect any major COVID disruptions in our business or our geographies. I do expect that there would be increased demand from our customers for us to supply vaccinated people and we are advocating that strongly in our business and for our employees. Safety is one of our key corporate values and we think keeping our employees safe is asking them to be vaccinated. We've had pretty good success. We need to have better success. We also don't think the supply chain issues as of today will be more pronounced than they are, they could be. But we do expect them to last for the balance of the year, and clearly, we don't control everything that goes on with the supply chain. As far as capital allocation, we spent nearly $57 million on acquisitions year-to-date. They were right down the pipe as far as the kind of things that we like to do. We returned $138 million year-to-date on share repurchases as Mark talked about and we also returned $14.2 million in dividends back to our shareholders. We expect to continue to be balanced capital allocators as the year progresses and we have a decent pipeline of acquisitions that we are working on. I will tell you unequivocally right now that one of the strengths of our company is our balance sheet. Our customers look to that balance sheet. That's one of the reasons we can grow as fast as we can organically and it's one of the reasons we've had so much success on a lot of the quick term work in these large data center projects and healthcare projects because people know that we will have the working capital and the ability to build the team on a very quick basis with the right labor at the right time and have the access to the capital to do that. With all that being said, I am happy to take questions. Jerome, open the line please. Hello, Noelle. There's three ways that this gets mitigated, yeah, and how it works, right? The first one is, our longer term projects where we lock in the price especially for major end components or major commodities where we've talked to distributors long before today. We're blessed to have good relationships. And businesses work together. I mean most pricing is protected on those large projects, because we're going to all work together through this period and we're all going to work together after this period of inflation. So there's a portion of our work that's protected. The next portion of our work is, you look at our composition of our company and you think about how much gets executed in short order, which is less than a year, which marks about two-thirds of what we do? So therefore, we're re-pricing that work all the time. We know today that we're in that environment. So there's two ways we'll mitigate that. We either lock it in for that 60 days or 90 days where we buy the material or we'll make it very clear to our customers that this is the component of what we couldn't buy that may fluctuate and your customers understand that. Now, if we're on a fixed price contract where they don't accept it, then we work extra hard to lock in the price. The third component of our work is time and material. Big chunk of the building services work, the small project work may not be time and material, but it's going to be executed in less than 60 days. It has a lot of the pricing characteristics of time and material work or it actually is time and material work and all of our industrial work which has very low material component, that's not purchased by the customer is time and material work. Mark, do you have anything to add on that? Yeah. Little more... Yeah. I think, Mark said -- he made a really important statement there and this is the CFO making the statement. We value both sides of that supply chain. So I like other large companies that we deal with at times. We don't take prepay discounts if we're not prepaying somebody or early paying somebody. We treat our suppliers the way we expect to be treated. And as a result of that, they tend to treat us fair in times like this. And we also have open communication. You think about a large distributor in a market, we may be, in many cases, their most important customer electrically and mechanically on what they're distributing. And we're the most important customer and you treat them right when times are maybe not as good as they were last year, they remember that now, just like we do. I mean, our best customers get our best labor and I think we get the best treatment from a lot of our suppliers, because our subsidiary CEOs deal very professionally with their suppliers at all times. That is how we conduct business. It's part of our corporate values. It's part of our code of conduct. It's how we treat people and it's how we expect to be treated. I think they may, but they're not going to delay beyond first quarter of next year. We don't think and that's where we're really seeing what we're really calling the real inflection. Clearly, we think the comps will be better as you move through the back half of this year for a lot of reasons. But we do think that they're rebuilding, they're getting their planning. We know what we're planning. Again, they'll be better this year, next year. I don't think they plan on deferring maintenance forever. Good morning, Sean. Good morning. I am always cautious to think of that especially thinking of the kind of booking we had in the first half. But I think you've heard me say this before, Sean. Every decision of size that we're involved with is a binary decision. What scopes to find, we don't get -- it's not like an OEM that gets a share of the market typically. So we won the project or we didn't win the project. We won more than we thought we were going to win in the first half of the year and we won the right kind of work. Could that happen again in the second half of the year with more velocity? Sure it could. I don't necessarily think overall activity is necessarily stronger than we thought it was going to be. We're winning more of the right work and the kind of work we won than we thought in a typical year. Mark? Yeah. I think one of the wild cards is supply chain. I think there were more conviction around the supply chain right now. I think booking activity would even be stronger. I think there's two things that are sort of holding back things right now. One on the supply chain issues, which are real and I think they center on two things. One is resumption of capacity, right? Capacity is coming back online both in the U.S. and overseas. And the second thing is availability of labor. We talk to our suppliers. They're figuring out the first part I think now, getting the materials, and really steel mills have started coming and that's the one I think prices should start coming down and it really hasn't in a substantial way yet. But the real one is labor. It's very difficult to hire labor, just come in and re-staff a lot of the plants. So, therefore, they're not operating at the capacity they would like to operate at. And I'll give you a real example, right? When we talk to some of our suppliers, the way you typically hire in the manufacturing environment, although we don't really do that, but the way you typically hire in a manufacturing environment, you would typically bring people in either seasonally or for a 60-day trial period. That 60-day trial period would typically be through a temp agency and really what you're trying to make sure is if the person show up to work, can we train them on the skills and can they pass the drug test? I mean, just to be very straight, that's what they're looking for. And then after 60 days people typically would get a pretty substantial raise. So they may have brought them in at $12 or $13 an hour and then raise them to $15, $18 an hour once they became full time. That whole first step isn't happening right now. And so, as a result, you're getting more churn in the permanent workforce, if they can find it and venture to say, I think, a big chunk of the manufacturing capacity that we draw from is probably still yet somewhere between 6% and 10% understaffed versus where they would like to be. Yeah. I mean, so you see what's going to go on with the project bookings. I mean, they're a little larger than they typically are, so the timing will be a little longer. So they may go into next year some of them. You're talking 20% plus organic growth in bookings. Underlying service growth is very strong. It's high single digits or will be and it should be through the summer. What's restraining that segment's growth right now is somewhat what's going on with the government business right now and it's nothing that we are terribly worried about, but it's slow award, slow decision making. Pretty much, Mark and I talk about it, we can pretty much play the playbook based on when the administration is changed and now it even happens at mid-term elections, so depending on what happens with Congress. So that's what sort of slowing things down. Good growth in commercial site, good growth in repair service, good growth in service agreements, good growth in controls, very strong growth in projects. So you are right to point out and we have a great team that anticipates those needs and did all the training they needed to do to have people ready. But you're right to point out there are some very good secular trends that we're benefiting from. Those trends also happen in the Mechanical Construction business, a portion of the revenues, Mark, what 15%, 20% of their revenues... ... is also service and small projects. Do you have anything to add to that? Okay. Thank you. Good morning, Adam. Thank you. What -- we don't do your modeling. So we look at the first half. We're expecting as good or better second half as the first half. But the wild card being what might happen in Industrial. So I don't know how you're thinking about the other parts, but that's how we're thinking about the world in general. I don't -- I think it should be better. But again we're cautiously optimistic and with an emphasis on the word cautiously. No. Nothing unusual. 6.4, what? Yeah. Adam, we don't do quarterly revenue and operating income guidance, you know that. I think they're pragmatic, you're reading it in the newspaper every day. Do they want the project done or not. We're being straight up with them, right? We tell them what we know. They're hearing it everywhere. So, their reacting is, I wouldn't say, it's shock and disappointment. The same characters, they would never want to pay for it. They don't want to pay for anything now and the ones that work with us and the ones we're working with. This is the time for us to be customer selective of where we are. Yeah. Sure. I mean, we've closed some deals here today. We have a couple more that we expect to close here in the near-term. They're either geographic expansions or product line expansions. And they've been different sizes. There are things that can be standalone and help us grow market or they're very niche things that we attach to existing operations. The pipeline is strong. What we are learning is some companies that thought they were ready to sell, post-pandemic maybe weren't quite ready to sell. They need six months maybe to get things ready to sell. But again, I think, I pointed out on the slide, we did about $0.5 billion of deal from 2018 till first quarter. There's no reason for me to believe it won't be at least that or more as we go through the next three years. As I've always said, deals happen when they happen. They're episodic. I feel better about the acquisition teams we have in place now than I ever have. I feel better about the due diligence we do now than I ever have. Deals might take longer now, right? There's other things you have to think about. You have to make sure you're doing good cyber due diligence and the targets clearly know that. You have to make sure you're doing good due diligence around what you really think happened to their demand in the pandemic and what's coming back. I think again the people we're working with to buy know that also. And then, of course, you've heard me whine consistently for any number of years now about multiples and private equity multiples. I am not going to do that anymore, because -- for me as a Pittsburgh Steeler fan, it's sort of like the New England Patriots beat us, they beat us, that's life. I am not sure they're beating us in long-term value creation. But all you have to do to win an acquisition is pay more in some cases and that's usually not the best acquisition for us. The best acquisition for us is some of the terrific people that have become part of our EMCOR team over the last number of years. I can go all the way back to when we bought S.A. Comunale in 2006 and Steve Comunale still proudly runs that company or Shambaugh that came with Comfort Systems and Mark Shambaugh running it and now Paul Meyers is a terrific operator with. And they take pride in what they do and they're building that business for the long-term and the work that Rob Vincent has done in fire protection or the team that came with R&R Mechanical and how Vincent sold his life's work to us and he is still in there every day swinging away and part of the team. And those are the best acquisitions for EMCOR. We see no shortage in the pipeline of people who really care about their business, their people and want a fair return on their life's work, but still want to work. And so I'll stick to what we do in the long-term value creation we have and not get crazy and try to compete with people that have a different view of the world and use leverage and slides and triangles and all that stuff to explain the business. I'll stick to what we know how to do. You're welcome. Good morning, Brent. Thank you. What I think is we're winning more projects. I don't ever think about share. So, yeah, I guess, we're winning more share. But the way I think about it, are we winning more of the projects that we're targeting? The answer to that is, yes. And I think we're winning more of those projects for three reasons. It starts with technical excellence, right? We got the best folks and we can do it safely and we do it right and we're going to be there to make sure that that product commissions the right way. And then, on the service side, we're going to bring some of the best technical resources to get buildings back up and running or to get that energy efficiency done, reduce people's carbon footprint and now bring an IAQ solution in with it, and Mike Bordes, and the team in energy services. Then I think it gets to the people on our segment level, Joe Burns and Dan Fitzgibbons, they've invigorated the teams. We had great teams to begin with and they've invigorated them to look at this market and look at that which you just said as an opportunity. We are more sophisticated. And we also, people know that we can bring the labor to bear and we can a lot of times get the best labor to bear. We have some of the best foremen and superintendents in the industry. They then interact some of the best labor in the industry. And I would now -- and just follow with what I think is often overlooked. When you're going to do a data center project that may be a hyperscale project, that's a 50-megawatt, a 75-megawatt project and you're going to burn $80 million of cost in nine months or less, you better have the liquidity and balance sheet to do that. And more and more customers are looking at our balance sheet and looking at our liquidity and looking at our ability to execute the other two things. And say, yeah, these guys could make that happen and they manage this business very conservatively and they manage it appropriately for the kind of contractors that they are. And I have great faith that the EMCOR folks will bring it to bear, and I'd add another thing, our folks are working better together through their peer learning and sharing of resources and ideas across our company than any time in my 17 years here. You know. Bad markets prove whether you have a good team or not. We have a great team. They've been operate -- they're operating near breakeven on an operating income basis, generating positive EBITDA. Mark, cash is, okay, right, tough market. I think, yes, the same applies there. Yeah. No. No. It might be a short-term dislocation on one project or two projects. And look, we may choose to do that. Because it's just like we talk about how our suppliers protect us. On the right projects we would protect our customers. That's life and we're not going to blow up our long-term relationship because of that if we think, hey, the customer did everything right here, we need to make this right. That doesn't typically happen on the large projects, but the smaller stuff we may do that. The second thing is what is constraining is potentially new starts? We haven't seen that yet. We might. But I'd give you a flip side of the argument that is likely to happen I think. We talked a lot about re-shoring and on-shoring of manufacturing capacity. I think this whole supply chain issue is actually an opportunity for us long-term. The long-term meaning the next two years to five years as more people look at creating flexibility in their factories and making them less labor dependent after what they've experienced over the last six months and more things come onshore. The trade relations are getting better with China. The situation is not anymore improved to Mexico. One of the things I know we talk to our customers is, we got collectively in industrial American a bad habit. We always thought about our most important products being dual sourced. At least dual sourced from a facility standpoint. It might be with the same supplier, but the supplier we expected to have dual facilities. We got away from that the last 10 years and we see that coming back pretty substantially right now across the Board. It's cyclical secular. Does that make sense? There's good long-term secular trends but we think it's going into a pretty good cycle right now. Thank you. Is that it? Hey. Look, thank you all for listening. We did have a very good quarter. Our folks are doing a lot of the right things and I know I am thankful to be surrounded by such great teammates every day and we're very aware of how hard the work is in the field. And I have a lot of passion on this subject about how we take care of our people. And I employ anybody that's listening from EMCOR to everything you can to encourage vaccinations, so we can start to put this pandemic behind us. One of our core values is safety and I look at this as squarely in the middle of that core value. With that, I'll leave you. Thank you and talk to you over the next couple of months. Bye."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the EMCOR Group First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]\nHaskel Kwestel: Thank you, Lara, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the EMCOR Group conference call. We are here today to discuss the company's 2021 first quarter results, which were reported this morning. I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Matz, Executive Vice President of Shared Services, who will introduce management. Kevin, please go ahead.\nKevin Matz: Thanks, Haskel, and good morning, everyone. As always, thank you for your interest in EMCOR, and welcome to our earnings conference call for the first quarter of 2021. Unbelievable that the Kentucky Derby is going to be run tomorrow or Saturday, and it's already May. For those of you who are accessing the call via the Internet in our website, welcome. And we hope you have arrived at the beginning of the slide presentation that will accompany our remarks today. We are on Slide 2. The presentation and discussion contains forward-looking statements and may contain certain non-GAAP financial information. Page two describes the details of the forward-looking statements and the non-GAAP financial disclosures. I encourage everyone to review both disclosures in conjunction with our discussion and accompanying slides. With me today are Tony Guzzi, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Pompa, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Executive Vice President and General Counsel, Maxine Mauricio. Actually, Mark is not the Treasurer any longer. I'm sorry, Mark, old title here. For call participants not accessing the conference call via the Internet, this presentation, including our slides will be archived in the Investor Relations section of our website under Presentations. You can find us at emcor.com. With that being said, please let me turn the call over to Tony. Tony?\nTony Guzzi: Yes. Thanks, Kevin. And I'm going to start my discussion on Pages 4 through 6. First, I'd like to welcome you all and what a different feeling we have in late April 2021 than we had in late April 2020 when we were in the throes of understanding of how to operate in a pandemic. I don't have to recount all the areas of uncertainty and turmoil we faced last year, not only at EMCOR, but our country and world writ large. However, at EMCOR, we were able to point to our values of mission first, people always. And they held us together and allowed us to perform at a very high level. These values served as our touch point to have a focus first on the health and safety of our employees. At the same time, we knew we also had to continue to serve our customers as we provided essential services across a range of projects and service calls. And again, like I always like to do, I'd like to thank all of our leaders and employees for their efforts. As demonstrated by our first quarter results, we continue to deliver strong performance by executing well for our customers while focusing on the well-being and safety of our employees. The first quarter of 2021 was an outstanding quarter by any measure. We earned $1.54 per diluted share versus $1.35 in the year-ago period on revenues of $2.3 billion with operating income margins of 5.1%. We had strong revenue growth in Mechanical Construction segment, up 8.4%. We had strong growth in our U.S. Building Services segment, up 10.3% and had strong growth in our UK Building Services segment, up 12.8%. That was aided somewhat by FX. We were essentially flat in our Electrical Construction segment. And as expected, we had a significant decline in revenues of over 35.3% in our Industrial Services segment, which was impacted not only by industry conditions but also the Texas Freeze, which in many cases, pushed out our turnaround schedule into the second quarter of 2021. And the work we did in connection with the freeze could not make up for the shortfall caused by that freeze. We also had a TRIR or a recordable incident rate of under one at 0.92, which was exceptional performance and again, shows our focus on safety and well-being throughout the pandemic, but really that's every day at EMCOR because it's one of our core values. These results, again, show the diversity of EMCOR's business with our ability to pivot to more resilient and stronger markets when some markets like the current downstream refining and petrochemical, oil and gas markets are weakened as a result of reduced demand. As we analyze our first quarter performance, we continue to earn strong operating income margins in our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments. At 8.8% in our Electrical Construction segment and 7.2% in our Mechanical Construction segment, these operating income margins show that we are earning very good conversion on the work that we win, and we are executing well on our contracts, which are largely fixed-price contracts. I intentionally use the word earned in describing these operating income margins. We have tough and demanding customers, who drive a very competitive bidding and selection process. The more complex the work, the more we compete not only on price but also on capability. We have to invest for productivity, not only through tools like BIM or Building Information Modeling prefab, but also better personal protective equipment and hand tools and individual work practices. But we also invest in training and best practice sharing so that we are always learning from each other\u2019s to employ the best means and methods for our work. We also must work collaboratively with our supply chain partners, and that is more important than ever as the economy starts back up to make sure that we have the right products at the right place, at the right price across our geography and portfolio of projects. This is especially important on large, complex projects with accelerated time schedules. Our subsidiary and segment leadership teams work hard to perform for our customers every day, and they are among the most skilled teams in our industry. Our U.S. Building Services team had an exceptional quarter, earning 5% operating income margins on 10.3% revenue growth. We had strong performance from mechanical services and both our government and commercial site-based businesses. We continue to have strong demand for mechanical retrofit projects and IAQ or indoor air quality solutions. Our site-based businesses continue to see increased demand for small project work from our total facility management customers. Our leadership from our subsidiaries to the business units to the segments are working well with our customers as they return to more in-office or on-site work. We are a trusted partner as they prepare and operate their facilities to keep their employees safe and improve their employee safety and peace of mind as they return to the workplace in a more significant way. And we do expect that to accelerate in the next few months. Our UK team is performing well and has experienced the same demand drivers and business context as our U.S. Building Services team. At 7.4% operating income margins and revenue growth of 4.5% without the impact of foreign exchange, we are doing very well. We continue to perform well in serving our customers, which have some of the most complex facility services needs in the UK. We also continue to execute well on our project work in the UK. We have a very good team, who are laser-focused on serving their customers well and have earned their customers' trust. Our Industrial Services segment had a tough quarter as expected. We earned positive EBITDA but we're slightly negative on an operating income basis. We have likely made positive operating income in this segment but for the impact of the Texas Freeze, which pushed out the turnaround schedule. We leave the quarter with increased remaining performance obligations or RPOs at $4.77 billion, up from $4.59 billion at year-end 2020, an increase from the year ago level of $4.42 billion. We will discuss our remaining performance obligation trends more later in my remarks. We exit the quarter with a pristine balance sheet. And we are putting that balance sheet to work to build our business and to return cash to our shareholders. With my opening complete, I'll now turn over the conversation to Mark, who will discuss his favorite quarter as he only has to comment on the quarterly performance. Mark?\nMark Pompa: Thank you, Tony, and my voice thanks you as well. Good morning to everyone participating on the call today. For those accessing this presentation via the webcast, we are now on Slide 7. Over the next several slides, I will augment Tony's opening commentary and review each of our reportable segment's first quarter operating performance as well as other key financial data derived from our consolidated financial statements included in both our earnings release announcement and Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier today. So. let's expand our review of EMCOR's first quarter performance. Consolidated revenues of $2.3 billion are up a modest $4.2 million or 20 basis points over quarter one 2020. Our first quarter results include $29.1 million of revenues attributable to businesses acquired pertaining to the period of time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in last year's first quarter. Acquisition revenues positively impacted each of our United States Electrical Construction, United States Mechanical Construction and United States Building Services segments. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired, first quarter consolidated revenues declined $24.8 million or 1.1% organically. Before reviewing the operating results of our individual reportable segments, I should point out that such results reflect certain reclassifications of prior year amounts due to changes in our internal reporting structure aimed at realigning our service offerings. Most notably, we have transferred our Ardent and Rabalais subsidiaries from our United States Electrical Construction segment to our United States Industrial Services segment. With that being said, I will now review the results of each of our reportable segments, starting with our revenue performance during the quarter. With the exception of United States Industrial Services and United States Electrical Construction, all of EMCOR's reportable segments experienced first quarter revenue growth. United States Electrical Construction quarter one revenues of $456.2 million, decreased $5.6 million or 1.2% from 2020's comparable quarter. Excluding acquisition revenues of $6.5 million, this segment's revenues declined 2.6% organically as revenue reductions within the manufacturing and transportation market sectors were only partially offset by increased project activities within the commercial and institutional market sectors. United States Mechanical Construction revenues of $903.9 million increased $69.8 million or 8.4% from quarter one of 2020. Revenue growth was primarily attributable to an increase in commercial, healthcare and transportation market sector activities due to continued strong demand for our services, partially offset by revenue declines within the manufacturing and institutional market sectors. This substantial quarterly revenue growth was despite a reduction in short-duration project volumes as a consequence of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and represents a new first quarter revenue record for this segment. EMCOR's total domestic construction business first quarter revenues of $1.36 billion, increased $64.2 million or 5% and reflects a strong start to the year. United States Building Services record quarterly revenues of $581.8 million increased $54.2 million or 10.3%. Excluding acquisition revenue contribution of $22.6 million, this segment's revenues increased to $31.6 million or 6% organically. Revenue gains within their commercial site-based services division due to an increase in event-driven snow removal as well as a resumption in project volume as certain customer facilities begin to reopen were the primary drivers in quarter-over-quarter revenue improvement. The segment's mobile mechanical services division additionally experienced stronger project and retrofit demand with an emphasis on services aimed at improving indoor air quality. United States Industrial Services revenues of $235.4 million decreased $128.5 million or 35.3% as this segment continues to be impacted by the negative macroeconomic conditions and uncertainty within the markets in which it operates. Additionally, and as Tony mentioned, the Industrial Services segment was negatively impacted by normal weather conditions and related power outages within the Gulf Coast region, which resulted in the delay of active projects and the deferral of previously planned maintenance and turnaround activities with certain of their customers. Although we were able to assist some of our customers with emergency repairs resulting from the February storm, this unplanned work was not enough to offset the lost quarterly revenue caused by these deferrals and delays. United Kingdom Building Services segment revenues of $126.7 million increased $14.3 million or 12.8% due to growth in project activities across the portfolio as customers began to release projects which were previously on hold due to COVID-19. This segment's results additionally benefited by $9.5 million as a result of the strengthening of the pound sterling, given the lifting of uncertainty around the terms of the United Kingdom's trade deal with the European Union that became effective on January 1, 2021. Please turn to Slide 8. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $224.1 million represent 9.7% of first quarter revenues and reflect a decrease of $2.9 million from 2020. SG&A for the first quarter includes approximately $2.4 million of incremental expenses from businesses acquired inclusive of intangible asset amortization expense, resulting in an organic quarter-over-quarter decline in SG&A of $5.4 million. This organic reduction is primarily attributable to lower employment costs as a result of reduced headcount due to various cost-control measures enacted during 2020 as well as a period-over-period decline in travel and entertainment expenses due to a combination of cost-avoidance measures as well as restricted company travel protocols. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation expense, predominantly within our United States Mechanical Construction segment, due to higher projected annual operating results than what was anticipated during the same prior year period. Reported operating income for the quarter of $117 million compares to $106 million in 2020's first quarter and represents an increase of $11 million or 10.4%. Operating margin of 5.1% has expanded by 50 basis points from the prior year's 4.6% operating margin. This performance reflects a new first quarter operating income and operating margin record for EMCOR. Our United States Electrical Construction segment's operating income of $40.3 million is consistent with 2020's quarter one performance. Reported operating margin of 8.8% represents a 10-basis point improvement over last year's first quarter as a result of a modest increase in this segment's gross profit margin. First quarter operating income of our U.S. Mechanical Construction segment of $65 million increased nearly $20 million from the comparable 2020 period, and operating margin of 7.2% represents a 180-basis point expansion year-over-year. This improved performance is primarily due to greater gross profit across most of the market sectors we serve as a result of both the volume increases previously referenced and a slight improvement in revenue mix as compared to the year-ago period. This segment's operating margin additionally benefited from a reduction in the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to revenues as a result of strong quarterly revenue growth without a commensurate increase in this segment's overhead cost structure. Consistent with the commentary during my revenue discussion, this performance has established a new first quarter record in terms of both operating income and operating margin for our United States Mechanical Construction segment. Our total U.S. construction business is reporting $105.2 million of operating income and a 7.7% operating margin. This performance has improved quarter-over-quarter by $19.7 million or 23.1%. Operating income for our U.S. Building Services segment of $29.3 million is an $8.1 million increase from last year's first quarter, while operating margin of 5% represents a 100-basis point improvement. An increase in gross profit resulting from greater snow removal activities with customers that are contracted on a per snow event basis within the segment's commercial site-based services division and an increase in gross profit from project building controls and repair activities within the segment's mobile mechanical services division were the primary drivers of the quarterly increase in operating income. In addition, the segment's operating income and operating margin benefited from a reduction in SG&A expenses as compared to the prior year due to the various cost-reduction actions instituted subsequent to the first quarter of 2020. This operating income and operating margin performance represent a new first quarter record for this segment. Our U.S. Industrial Services segment operating loss of $2.4 million represents a decline of $17.9 million when compared to operating income of $15.4 million in last year's first quarter. The reduction in period-over-period operating results is due to the previously referenced adverse market conditions, which this segment continues to face as well as the impact of February's extreme winter weather event. In addition, performance of this segment was negatively impacted by lower plant and labor utilization due to significant reduction in revenues. On a positive note, this segment was able to partially offset these negative headwinds with a nearly 21% reduction in first quarter selling, general and administrative expenses due to certain cost savings initiatives enacted in calendar year 2020. UK Building Services operating income of $9.4 million or 7.4% of revenues represents an improvement of $3.6 million and 230 basis points of operating margin expansion over 2020's first quarter. This performance represents an all-time quarterly record for operating income and operating margin as we experienced a strong resumption in project work during the quarter as the United Kingdom market approaches the hopeful conclusion of their COVID-19 lockdown mandates. Additionally, operating income for the quarter benefited from approximately $800,000 of favorable foreign exchange rate movement. We are now on Slide 9. Additional financial items of significance for the quarter not addressed in my previous slides are as follows. Quarter one gross profit of $341.1 million represents 14.8% of revenues, which has improved from the comparable 2020 quarter by $8 million and 30 basis points of gross margin. Both our gross profit and gross profit margin represent new first quarter records for EMCOR despite the significant headwinds we continue to experience within our United States Industrial Services segment. Diluted earnings per common share in the first quarter is $1.54 as compared to $1.35 per diluted share for the prior year period. This $0.19 or 14.1% improvement establishes a new quarter one record for the company and also ties the all-time quarterly diluted earnings per share record, which we previously achieved in quarter four of 2019. We are now on Slide 10. As evident from Slide 10, EMCOR's liquidity profile remains strong. Cash on hand is down from year-end 2020 primarily as a result of cash used in operations due to the funding of 2020's companywide incentive compensation awards as well as the funding of our United Kingdom subsidiaries' VAT deferral from the prior year. Additionally, we repurchased $13 million of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program and utilized nearly $32 million of cash and investing activities, including $24 million to fund the two acquisitions that we completed during the first quarter of this year. Working capital levels have increased modestly primarily due to a reduction in our current liabilities, given a decrease in accounts payable as well as a reduction in accrued payroll and benefits due to the previously mentioned funding of prior year incentive awards, the increase in goodwill as a result of the businesses acquired within our United States Electrical and United States Mechanical Construction segments. Net identifiable intangible assets have decreased as a result of approximately $15 million of intangible asset amortization expense, partially offset by the impact of additional intangible assets recognized in connection with the previously referenced 2021 acquisitions. Total debt, exclusive of operating lease liabilities, is virtually unchanged since year-end 2020. As a result of our consistent outstanding borrowings and the growth in stockholders' equity due to our net income for the quarter, EMCOR's debt-to-capitalization ratio has reduced to 11.5%. Our balance sheet remains pristine and in conjunction with our available credit allows us to invest in our business, return capital to shareholders and execute against our strategic objectives as we navigate through ever-changing market conditions. With my portion of the slide presentation completed, I would like to return the call to Tony. It's all yours, Tony.\nTony Guzzi: Thanks, Mark, and just for everybody's indication, on the \u2013 at year-end call, I did turn my mic on in time. I'm going to be on Page 11, remaining performance obligations by segment and market sector. So, if I had to sum it up in a lot of ways, in 2020, we had a lot of COVID disruption here in this quarter, the first quarter going to the second. We have a little bit of that left, but for the most part, first quarter 2021, the demand environment and the project bidding for construction and service projects were continuing to be active. As I mentioned earlier, total remaining performance obligations or RPOs at the end of the first quarter were just under $4.8 billion, up $351 million or 7.9% when compared to the year-ago level of $4.4 billion. And RPOs increased $181 million for the first three months of the year from the year-end level of $4.6 billion Our domestic construction segments experienced strong project growth in the quarter, with the RPOs increasing $219 million or 6.1% since the year-ago period of March 31, 2020. All but $15 million of that is organic growth. The $15 million belongs to a Chicago-based electrical contractor that really focuses on infrastructure that joined us in February. Building Services segment RPOs increased in the quarter $121 million or 22% from the year ago quarter, a portion of which was the August 2020 acquisition of a Washington D.C. full-service mechanical contractor. However, more representative of what we are now experiencing in this segment, RPOs grew $60 million or up 10% from December 31. All of that is organic growth. And to paraphrase what I said in February, this work is both the resumption of regularly scheduled mechanical systems maintenance. So, we're maintaining systems that haven't been running full out, and then small project work as a result is coming back in. And then there's modifications and improvements around that on efficiency and indoor air quality. If you go to the right side of that page by market sector, clearly, our largest sector for RPOs continues to be commercial projects. And we're continuing to see strength, and I'll talk about this on the next page, in the resilient sectors that we've highlighted such as data center. And I call it supply chain's buildup for e-commerce delivery and fulfillment. That commercial segment, which also includes the retrofit activity and new build, is 44% of total RPOs. For the year-over-year and sequential quarter-over-quarter comparison, commercial RPOs increased $314 million and $216 million, respectively. The rest of this sector is pretty much netted as in and out as project activity increased a little in some sectors and decreased a little in others. And that's really just the normal ebb and flow of project activity. In general, project interest is favorable in most all sectors with the exception of hospitality that continues to be challenged. As an indication of future market activity, the March ABI came out a week or so ago. And while I think this is a soft index always, it's worked on a board survey from architects and its self-reported numbers. But it's been the same forever, so it's okay. If it's consistently that way, then you can start to draw trends off of it. It jumped over 50, which is expansion territory in February and was over 55 in March. And one of the analysts noted the regional scores, for the most part, were in positive territory, and the general outlook was upbeat. Now that's clearly true from a year-ago period. Correspondingly, the March Dodge Momentum Index, which is an index of nonresidential building projects in planning, also posted a pair of strong gauge in February and March. It's up low double digits at 11% from a year-ago period, pretty much right before the full impact of the pandemic. Look, I think, it's important for me to just take a step back here. First quarter of last year was a good quarter. And until the pandemic came, it was probably one of the best economies that, in my business career, I've ever operated in. So that's the compare that a lot of these numbers are coming off of. So, it's important to know that. And both of these leading indicators are indicators of potential future activity. They're moving in tandem, which is what we like to see. And we do a whole bunch of other analysis, and I'll talk about that later of what we're going to \u2013 what we believe could happen to nonres this year. I'm now going to jump to Page 12, and I'm going to give you a little updated commentary on these resilient sectors that we talk about. If you look at the first two, I'd like to think about that as the build-out of our data infrastructure and our supply chain infrastructure. That's still very strong. It's concentrated in about \u2013 on the data center Side 5 or 6 geographic areas. We're in 60%, 70% of those areas now either electrically or mechanically. We continue to build our data center maintenance business. And on the warehousing side, these are the big million square foot-plus warehouses. For the most part, this is a life safety play for us on the fire protection side. I would argue we are the best in the business at it. Not only are we providing a great solution, we do it cost effectively, and we do it time efficiently. And we got some of the best prefab capability in the industry. We're also doing targeted electrical work depending on the region of the country on these warehouses.  Industrial and manufacturing, it's down a little bit for us right now, but that's really driven by food process, which we have a pretty good pipeline of potential opportunities. But we're actually very bullish on manufacturing because of where we play. We do see supply chain reshoring back to the southeast. That could be either out of Asia, most notably China, or Mexico as people look for redundant supply. I don't think we want to go \u2013 people on their high-margin projects want to be caught in a situation like they were at the beginning of the pandemic, or I do think we're in a decoupling mode versus China as far as supply to the U.S. I think the other part is we are in some good secular markets that we expect to continue, most notably, semiconductors. We are very strong in some of the key markets, whether they be Arizona, which were very strong mechanically. We have a terrific team in Arizona that does this work superbly. This is very difficult work and very complex. And the team we have in Arizona that execute is the best in the business. We also have electrical capability in Utah, which is the Salt Lake City area, which is another one of the semiconductor hubs. And we also have electrical capability in the Pacific Northwest, most notably the Portland area, which is also a semiconductor hub. These are the three major hubs. We have capability in each, and we have great relationships with both our general contractor customers and construction management customers as well as the OEMs and end users. Health care, we continue to see strength. We've made the right acquisitions. You look at the work we'll be doing down in the Georgia market with BKI. You look at the work we'll do in the Houston market with Gowan. You look at the work we'll do \u2013 continue to do in the Midwest with Shambaugh and a combination of companies. And you look at the work we'll continue to do in California. The healthcare market continues to be very strong for us. And I just gave you a couple of markets. We really do this work, broadly speaking, across the country. And we do it both in a retrofit basis, which we expect more and more mechanical and electrical retrofits. And we also see new build coming back in healthcare. Again, this is both a construction opportunity for us and a maintenance opportunity for us. I think one thing people appreciated when they were an EMCOR customer through the pandemic is we can help them make their facilities more flexible when they needed to, to handle patient surges or different kinds of healthcare they needed to deliver. Water and wastewater continues to be a good market for us, especially in Florida. These projects can be lumpy in how they get delivered. We've got one of the best teams in the industry down in Florida, and we're very proud of them. I'll get to the last two, mechanical services, indoor air quality. We're the best in the business at this. The OEMs develop solutions, but they need a company like EMCOR to be able to deliver those solutions. And we deliver these solutions as good or better, and I would say better on a consistent basis than anybody in the industry. That's both the mechanical services, to fix things; indoor air quality, as their whole well building concept becomes more prevalent; and then finally, on efficiency. And we've been the best efficiency people for a long, long time. I would add another sector that sort of overlays this. We will participate in any energy transition. People ask us about that. And clearly, when you have the best pipe fitters and electricians in the business and the people that know how to supervise them, you're going to be part of that. We already are part of it on small-scale solar in a more significant way out in California. The way I think about small-scale solar is the way I thought about distributed generation and cogeneration. That's really what it is in 20 megawatts or less. As you get to the bigger things, we are building capability, especially in Texas right now. We'll see how that goes. I think it's going to go well, and we'll continue to build that capability and anything that the refiners do along the line of carbon capture, it's pipe. And I'm very happy that Exxon and people like Valero are talking more about renewables, renewable diesel and carbon capture. We'll be there to help them do that. So, we feel good about these resilient markets. We don't chase fads at EMCOR. We build capability, and we execute. And we can pivot around these markets, and we've done that over a long period of time. I'm going to finish now on Page 13 and 14. As we entered 2021, let's think about what the context of it was. Vaccinations were just starting to get rolled out. We were in a world of COVID surges in parts of the country. And as February started to come, we gave guidance, but that was our backdrop. But we continued to perform. Our folks are resilient, and they're really good at what they do. In that initial guidance, we gave you about seven, eight weeks ago, we expected to earn $6.20 to $6.70 in earnings per diluted share. And if you look at that midpoint, that would be another record year, Mark, after how many, seven? So pretty good. And we expected to do that on $9.2 billion to $9.4 billion in revenue. And so, we clearly thought that the revenue was going to accelerate as the year went on. And think about the tough compare we're having here in the first quarter with industrial. Up until the third week of March of last year, industrial was having a very good first quarter. So, we went back. We thought about it and we said, okay, we had a better first quarter than we expected. And so, with that, we're going to raise the low end of our guidance range to $6.35. That's a $0.15 movement from the $6.20. And we're going to take the top end of the range up about a $0.05 or $6.75 per diluted share. We're going to keep revenue guidance where it is, and we'll certainly know more about that when we get out of the second quarter. And as we said in February 2021, we did expect 2021 to be another year of outstanding performance. But let's think about this. We have to execute every day. We're doing this across 4,000 projects of size of $250,000 or more. But if you added up all our projects, we're doing this now over about 12,000 projects and service events. And if you take service calls, it's multiples of that. And we have to do that against the backdrop of record operating income margins in our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments in 2020. And we do expect those increased revenues to help us mitigate some of that challenge. So, when we gave you our guidance, we laid out some assumptions. And what I'm going to do now is talk about what that assumption was and what the update on that assumption is now eight weeks later with first quarter in the books. So, the first assumption was our Industrial Services segment, as many of you know, primarily serve the downstream petrochemical and refining markets. We didn't think it would materially improve until the fourth quarter and that it would gain momentum going into 2022 as demand for refined products will continue to be challenged early in 2021, especially through the end of the second quarter. Demand is picking up. So, let's talk about what that view is now. We still believe as far as performance in the segment, that's the accurate view of the market. Some trends are clearly positive now. Crack spreads are very good in high teens. The renewable diesel market is a market we're helping our customers get ready for and serve through upgrades and adaptation of their facilities. And refinery utilization has moved into the low 80s, trending toward the mid-80s. We fully expect that to be in the high 80s by early June. It's going to be driven by really aviation fuel at this point. So, we had an assumption at the beginning of the year also that the nonresidential market would decline modestly. What do we think now? We think that market potentially could be flat for the year. And the second quarter trends will provide more insight as we may see accelerating demand through the year. This market now could have either breakeven performance or modest growth in 2021. We also said that we would continue to execute well on our more resilient market sectors to include manufacturing, commercial driven by data center and logistics warehousing, water and wastewater and all the things I just mentioned on the previous page. We still think that's true and even more true today. And we do expect as the year to go on that manufacturing gains strength, and we'll see it first in our backlog. We did talk about the COVID environment. We did not expect a more restrictive COVID environment than what we were operating in as we gave guidance in February. We did expect a more normal operating environment as the year progressed. We talked about that we were operating near 100% capability. We don't use the word capacity because we always look \u2013 we can add tradespeople. We've learned how to work under these COVID precautions. It does require a lot more planning, and we have to be much more precise in our execution. But you know what? That's sort of how we operate anyway. And it's nothing new for us to keep our employees' safety first. It's one of our core values, and quite frankly, people would not want to work for us if it was not. So, what's my updated view on that? I believe that as we enter third quarter, move through third quarter into fourth quarter, more of our job sites will start to be \u2013 look more normal in conditions in most of the states that we operate in because we continue to see positive trends in those states. And we will see that in the UK, too. I mean, we just talked to our UK folks this morning. 38 million out of 68 million \u2013 66 million people in the UK this morning were operating in parts of the country that had zero COVID cases yesterday reported. I think that might happen here as our vaccinations continue to pick up. We do expect \u2013 we said we expect to continue to help our customers with IAQ, energy efficiency replacement projects, optimizing their systems and helping bring their employees back to work. I would say that's going as expected. So, then you say, \"How do we go from where we are at the low end of the range, the midpoint of the range to the top end of the range?\" I'd say that each one of those trends or mix of those trends get better. So maybe the nonres market's better than we thought it was, especially for projects that can be completed in the year. And that's especially true as things normalize and work normalizes and people start to spend more capital. Our refining and petrochemical customers begin to gain more comfort with improved demand for refined products. And they say, \"Look, instead of trying to bunch all that work into 2022, we start to pull some of that work forward into 2021.\" That would be a logical thing to do. They do worry about manpower in tight \u2013 when they have a bunch of work scheduled. We may be able to have some of those discussions. Momentum in IAQ and efficiency accelerates. That could happen, especially on the efficiency side as folks realize that all the investment in IAQ actually hurts efficiency. And their customers will be demanding them to make their facilities more efficient. And look, we've got to keep our productivity strong as we transition. We want to keep some of those gains we've made with scheduling. We want to keep the emphasis we've had on prefab even on smaller jobs as we transition. I think \u2013 I sort of know we will. But we have to keep that first and foremost in our minds, and of course, we're not going to open the floodgates on travel. Mark talked a little bit about the organic SG& A. That's more positive than you think it is because he had a sentence in there that was pretty key. Think about the outlook we were taking on incentive compensation last year versus this year. We told you we expected to have organic reduction of around $15 million, $20 million. We're at the high end of that right now on a run rate basis. And if we have increased incentive long term, that's a good thing in our field operations because that means we're doing better. The other thing that I know you ask about, and I'll just get in front of it now a little bit is on stimulus. The thing that will impact us this year, the government spending that will impact us this year is all related to these COVID emergency packages. We will benefit from that because of the money that went to the states and municipalities to make their budgets more flushed to allow them to complete some of their smaller capital projects and get some of the transit systems moving again. It will help them think through that and start that. We'll also benefit from some of the spending that's going to go on institutions and schools. Again, go back to this IAQ efficiency and building wellness theme. We're seeing that already. That's what will impact 2021. If this larger infrastructure package of about 50% of the money, give or take, is stuff we could participate in or projects we could potentially participate in, that for the most part is a late 2022, early 2023, likely late 2023, early 2024 event for us. You think about everything that has to happen with a project to get it going. And I think let's all recall late 2008, early 2009. For large-scale infrastructure projects, yes, there's concepts that people want to execute. People don't do detailed design on concept. And so, as we learned back then, there's no such thing as a shovel-ready project. There isn't here either. But one of the things that could be quicker is if we get energy efficiency dollars right and figure out how to flow that out, which, in my mind, would be through the utilities in their programs. The other thing you'll ask about is labor. Look, we're sort of at the top end of that food chain. That's not something that we had issues with. I do think I'm glad I'm not a painter or a roofer or a cleaner right now because there is headwinds about hiring labor at the low end, especially with the enhanced employment benefit \u2013 unemployment benefit. It requires us \u2013 also on the factory side, we're lucky to be who we are because we can, like I said earlier, work closely with our supply chain partners and work real hard to mitigate the impact because they're also having difficulty ramping up. And you probably heard that on all the calls with the manufacturers. I'm sure you did. When we get to capital allocation, we had a lot of detail on that in our year-end discussions. Our guidance contemplates that we will continue to be disciplined capital allocators. And we'll do that between organic growth, which we love to fund; acquisitions; share repurchases; and dividends. We're on track to meeting \u2013 toward meeting that goal this year. This year, we've already done three acquisitions. We have a very good pipeline. Those may be moving a little slower as we try to understand the impact of pandemic on operations, but we'll get through that. And we feel very good about our pipeline right now. And with that, Lara, I'll take questions. Thank you for your interest in EMCOR, and we'll turn the call over to you.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now live. You go ahead please.\nBrent Thielman: Okay, great. Thank you. Good morning.\nTony Guzzi: Good morning, Brent.\nBrent Thielman: Hey Tony, I wanted to touch on something you mentioned in your closing remarks there, just about sort of maybe a return on the job sites back to what it once was pre-COVID in terms of processes and how things go on the job site. Do you think that helps the margins even more from here? Or how do we think about sort of financial implications of that down the road?\nTony Guzzi: Yes. I think it's way too early for us to think it could help the margins. We're pretty happy where our margins are right now. But it will be interesting, the push and pull of will we be able to keep some of this enhanced scheduling. In some cases, we will. Some cases, we won't. Will we be able to work swing shifts without a lot of pay differential? I think some of our folks have started to like that because they like not being on a crowded job site, and they like being more productive. And then they can put pressure back on their \u2013 the union and others to help us do that. So, I think it's too early to tell. I think there are some hard-wired things that we'll benefit from. Our folks have got better and better at planning just the things we control. And they've gotten better and better even on the smaller jobs of using prefabrication and trying to get the work off the site. So hopefully, we can keep productivity where it is. That's our plan, and maybe we can pick up a little bit.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. And then it also came up in your opening commentary, but we also obviously hear about supply chain disruptions here and there in the market. Maybe anything in particular that you're running into that you've really had to work hard through? I'd be curious about that.\nTony Guzzi: Nothing has risen to the level where people are calling me to reach out to the Chief Executive Officer of a distributor, which I've done in the past, or a Chief Executive Officer of an OEM. So that means we're relatively getting through our normal mechanism what we need to stay productive on a job. I'm not sure that's true for everybody, but you think about who EMCOR is in a local market. We're known as being a very fair partner to deal with. We pay people. We pay them on time. We work with them and do a lot of preplanning, especially on the large jobs. We're innovative. We think about ways to have our suppliers help us to the point we work a lot on inventory management together. We try not to have them be surprised. And then, of course, we have big relationships. And we also tend to be pragmatic business people. Sometimes, we don't go for the last dollar on a negotiation because assurance of supply to us, when your workforce is as expensive as ours, is way more important than the extra nickel on a roll of wire or a line of \u2013 a foot of pipe.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. Appreciate that. Maybe my last question, Tony, is just understanding the indoor air quality opportunity. It's obviously something that comes up with investors a lot. Is that \u2013 is it something that's meaningfully impacting the RPOs today? Or is it \u2013 I mean, obviously, still best yet to come there?\nTony Guzzi: Yes, I'm going to ask Mark to help me with this. But the reality is it will probably never meaningfully affect the RPOs. What it does is it meaning affect growth in a quarter in Building Services because most of this is work \u2013 RPOs for us, for the most part, is projects that stick around through a quarter. This work tends to be in and out and tends to be smaller ticket item.\nMark Pompa: Yes. So, Brent, just to amplify Tony's commentary, this stuff is fairly quick turn. So, we're getting the award, and we're executing the work within the construct of a quarter. So, you're not going to actually see it hit the RPO number disclosed at the end of the quarter. And what's actually hitting there relative to the huge amount of RPO that EMCOR has as a consolidated enterprise is just not meaningful.\nTony Guzzi: And Brent, we don't talk a lot about this. But I got to give our folks a lot of credit on this one. Back last year, four weeks before we're sitting here today, as early as March 30 of last year, we were gearing up to be able to deliver these solutions. And we had all the relationships. This was part of our arsenal of things we would deliver to a customer. But some of this was these tools, because it hurts efficiency, people weren't that excited about. I got to give a lot of credit to Mike Bordes and his team. They took advantage of the downtime with a lot of our technicians. And they took advantage with our salespeople and our service supervisors and our small project managers. And we did a ton of training from about March 25 of last year until June one when we could really go back out and offer these solutions. And you had to have all the OEM relationships in place. You had all the supply chain in place. We also had to have the front end trained so people could go and implement. And so, we were thinking about this, I'm venturing to say, long before other people to be able to deliver. And we were proactive with our customers and not reactive.\nBrent Thielman: Great. Thank you, guys, for taking the question.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Your next question will come from the line of Adam Thalhimer from Thompson, Davis. Your line is now live. Go ahead please.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey, good morning guys. Congrats on the great start to the year.\nTony Guzzi: Thank you.\nAdam Thalhimer: Can you help us with moving Ardent into industrial? How much revenue shifts?\nTony Guzzi: Mark will take that.\nMark Pompa: With regards to the quarter? Or are you looking at the full year?\nAdam Thalhimer: Full year.\nMark Pompa: Full year 2020 or full year 2021?\nAdam Thalhimer: Well, I need 2021. If you give me 2020, I think that will help.\nMark Pompa: I'm not going to give you 2021. So, I'll give you 2020. So, it's roughly 100...\nAdam Thalhimer: You offered. You offered.\nMark Pompa: I want to make sure I'd be able to respond to your question.\nTony Guzzi: We just want to make sure you're on your toes, Adam.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay.\nMark Pompa: So full year 2020, it's $143 million that's going to move out of Electrical Construction into industrial.\nAdam Thalhimer: Perfect. Okay. And then the UK, and Mark, you mentioned there was a currency benefit there, but had a great quarter. I'm just curious how sustainable.\nTony Guzzi: Look, like we always say, and probably much to ad nauseam for all of you, these aren't quarter-to-quarter businesses. But for those that have been with us a long time that we're consistently operating in the UK north of 5% now three years in a row. It might be 7% one quarter. It might be 4.9% one quarter. But if we can keep that between the goalpost of 5% to 6% on an annual basis, we're doing pretty well. And what really drove it was the project mix. And if that continues and again, this is not pricing. This is execution, and this is really, really good work.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. And then the last one, the margin was really good at mechanical. You talked about some food processing jobs. Are those jobs done? Or are those going to keep burning this year?\nTony Guzzi: Look, we always have some food processing work, but the large project work, the large project we were doing is pretty much through commissioning now. We have other things on the board. And the way this works is you have a lot of contingencies and really complex projects on commissioning. So, we're starting to move through some of those contingencies. But let's be clear, that's not what \u2013 the only thing that drove that performance. This was across a lot of work, a lot of projects. Mark also made a comment that unless you're really listening, you might have not picked up on. We had those \u2013 that increased revenue with very little increased cost. And so, at the end of the day, we're getting good fall-through because, again, go to the productivity point. We're probably benefiting more from productivity in our mechanical segment because of what they're doing on prefab and planning than in any part of EMCOR, especially in our \u2013 we like to call them the power companies. But what I mean by that, these are large subsidiaries. They really have got this down right now. And then Joe Burns and his team are probably as good as anybody at taking those means and methods and spreading them through the company where applicable.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. I'll go ahead and turn it over. Ramp up those buybacks, guys \u2013 thank you for the time.\nTony Guzzi: I'll tell you how we really feel, Adam.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question will come from the line of Noelle Dilts from Stifel. Your line is now live. Go ahead please.\nTony Guzzi: Good morning Noelle. How are you?\nNoelle Dilts: Hi. Doing well. How are you?\nTony Guzzi: Good.\nNoelle Dilts: So \u2013 great. So, you talked about supply chains a bit. But I was curious if you could just speak to \u2013 we've obviously seen a lot of inflation in raw material costs and steel. I understand most of your costs are made of labor, but how are you \u2013 consistent labor, but how are you thinking about or watching some of those \u2013 the raw material increases? And if there may be more of an indirect impact on your business?\nTony Guzzi: Look, if not handled correctly, within a quarter or two, that could be a direct impact. We \u2013 again, go back to the supply chain discussion I had. We work really hard on large projects to try to lock in the best we can, the prices, especially on the major components, gear, chillers, air handlers, all that typically gets locked in. And we're not speculators in that. We make our price, we figure it out, and that's what we go with. We also don't run. So, when we talk about being fair, right? Typically, our guys don't run back if the price moves down to those suppliers and say, \"Okay, now I need a reduction.\" We made our deal. And of course, now in more commodity inflationary times, they realize that. The other thing is most of our work is getting repriced, and in a sense, this smaller project work, this stuff that's less than a couple of million, all the time. What I mean by that is we're doing new work, right? So therefore, we reprice it. We were talking about this, Mark and I, as this round of commodity inflation would be, for him and I, probably about the seventh time we've seen this, eighth time together. Yes, together. We've seen it more than that, but together, we've seen it. Many years ago, I was on the other side of this, trying to ramp through price increases. We really have not been stung bad by this through time. We know the copper game. Our electrical Chief Executive Officers are as good as an estimator as good as anybody in the business as our mechanical guys. I'll make \u2013 I'll go out on a limb here. I might end up being wrong. I doubt it on this one. Steel prices will come down because capacity will come back online. Steel guys typically can't help themselves. We will not be three times what we were before this pandemic of flat cold-rolled as we are today. That won't be the case. And our guys also \u2013 we internally have a very good team that makes sure that our folks know the trends in commodities are coming. You say, \"Okay, how does a company like EMCOR get that?\" It's not like we have a group of economists. Best I got is Kevin and someone that works for him. So, I mean, these are not folks who spend their time analyzing them. How we get good at it is we have great relationships with our distributor partners. And they try to keep us in front of what they're seeing on the things they're buying. And again, all the people always say, \"What's the benefits of scale?\" That information, that knowledge is a huge benefit of scale. And then finally, I'd offer, Noelle, just to sort of break out for you that how \u2013 where we really are. If you take the mechanical business, 45%, 55% of a job can be materials and equipment depending on whether we buy it or the customer does on some of the big systems. And on the electrical side, that's closer to 35% to 45% of materials, and the balance is labor. That's for the mechanical and electrical segments. You get to Building Services, a little less because of the time and material nature of repair service and the labor-based component of our repair projects and our service agreements and our site-based business. Mechanical service business, give or take, is about 50-50 equipment to labor. And as you go to Industrial Services, it's 80-10 \u2013 80-20 I mean. And the only thing, the reason it gets to 20% on materials is the work we do on the shop. And remember, most of our materials in the shop are customer provided on the big stuff. They're buying the tubes and stuff. So, our exposure on materials are really in the electrical and mechanical segments. And our guys keep in front of that pretty good. And if we have a blip or exposed, it's very short. Mark, do you have anything to add?\nMark Pompa: No. Tony, you pretty much caught that. Noelle, I think just to echo Tony's point, and I think because we're such a large customer for the wholesalers that we're sourcing from, and we're consistent with where \u2013 how we're procuring our materials, we have \u2013 it's very rare that people do not honor their pricing once we get it. And we obviously strive to get price quotes as close as possible to when we're going to mobilize on work. So, we try to minimize the window of time that we would be exposed to any of that commodity inflationary pressure. But as Tony said, if we do get stung, it would be isolated instances. And it would only impact a quarter and will not prolong itself through the remainder of the year.\nNoelle Dilts: Okay. Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you. I guess just shifting over kind of circling back to the infrastructure bill. Clearly, both the Democratic proposal and the Republican proposal \u2013 or counterproposal are talking about really big numbers. Really, we're talking about massive increases in the market. How are you guys thinking about the industry capacity to support more work coming in, whether in terms of labor, do you think you'd be able to kind of find the right folks to ramp up relatively quickly as some of that funding comes in? Thanks.\nTony Guzzi: I mean, the answer to the EMCOR-specific is on the projects that EMCOR will bid, on the projects that EMCOR will win, and that will be an increase to what we're doing today, which is we think, again, go back to what I said, even without this infrastructure bill, we expect non-res to maybe have a growth year versus what was an expected down year this year. EMCOR won't take a job unless we have the capacity to do it. And we believe we will have the capacity to grow if that infrastructure bill comes into the market. It will be a meaningful part of the industry, and it will cause the industry to grow. And we typically outgrow the industry. Second to that, will the industry be able to absorb it? I think the answer to that's yes. I think \u2013 like the industry always struggles at the low end. Somehow, we'll find a way to get through that. Where we're at, again, I always use this example. I can't worry about what all my competitors do, but I'll tell you how we think about it. We think we're a destination of choice for trade labor. And why is that? Go back to that discussion we had on safety. It's a core value. We give people the right equipment. They know that, that's fundamental to who we are. The second thing is, they know they're going to have confident supervision. You need \u2013 and that's all the way up, right? These three people I'm sitting around the table with today, including four with me, we all have deep, deep respect and have a pretty good knowledge of the challenges skilled trade labor focus on and have to do in execution of their job. It gets better as you go down because now, you're getting more technical, and they're led by people that know how to help them do their job. That's really important. The third thing is they know they're going to get paid. That's \u2013 it sounds simple. But if you work for a smaller contractor, that may or may not happen in a given week. And the fourth thing is, if they do a good job for us, really there's only two or three places in the country where the union says, \"Hey, you need to take these people or you need to rotate these people up.\" We pick our workforce. We have rights over that, and they know that they could become part of our \"permanent workforce\" and always have a job. You put those \u2013 and with EMCOR's leadership position in most markets, you put those four things together, I don't think we'll have trouble finding that labor, but others might. And \u2013 but that's no different than any other upmarket that we're in. I will say one of the things that would be helpful, and I actually think it will be one of the positives, right, is the labor department is actually being run by somebody right now that really understands skilled labor training. And we'll see if he can make that successful.\nNoelle Dilts: Okay. Great. And I guess last question for me is a shorter one. You mentioned that the pandemic has slowed deal flow a bit, but could you just speak to what you're kind of seeing in terms of pricing or multiple trends, given that there is now, I think, more incremental optimism around nonresi and infrastructure?\nTony Guzzi: I mean, look, their multiples might drift up a half a turn or a turn, but so does ours, right, even more than that. And so, we'll still have the same disciplined process we always have. And we could show you a slide and you go, \"Wow. You actually got to seal all those deals?\" It starts with 200, and then it goes to 50, and then it goes to 20, and then it goes to five, and we may close three, right? But at the end of the day, I'm not looking at 200. We have folks that look at books maybe or reach out to owners or owners call us. We have a pretty good idea of the kind of companies we want to buy and who they are. We work with them over a long period of time. Where we're best is when someone's selling their life's work or their family's life's work, and they still want to be part of the solution going forward. We're not looking to make the best financial deal. What I mean by that is we're not bargained \u2013 just like I talked about how we're fair with our suppliers, we look to be fair with the people selling us their business. They're going to be our partners going forward. Secondarily, we want to make sure that we both buy into the business case and what it looks like going forward. So private \u2013 if it's a big auction run by some of the notorious banks that are going to do narrow, and narrow to them means 150 people looking at it, we're probably not going to be successful. And in fact, I'm not even sure we look at much of that anymore. A lot of times, people will hire intermediary. But their intermediaries hire to get to us and to put structure around the process. And a lot of times, we're at the top of that list. And like I said, we try to be very fair on terms and conditions, and we try to be very fair on price that works for both of us. And you think about what we've done and you say, \"Wow, I didn't know you did that.\" We've done five deals since May of last year through a pandemic. Now none of them have been earshots. We've been pretty good, though. And we see nothing that will abate us from doing that or more, and there might be even larger ones coming in there, which means bigger contractors that we know for a very long period of time, and they have terrific reputations. And we got just sort of delayed a little bit with the pandemic.\nNoelle Dilts: Okay, thank you.\nTony Guzzi: Mark or Kevin? Mark, you have anything to add? Anything else? Lara?\nOperator: Yes, thank you sir. We have last question coming from Mr. Sean Eastman from KeyBanc Capital. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please.\nSean Eastman: Hi team. Nice quarter. It's got to be a relief to comp earnings up mid-teens on that first quarter. So that's excellent. I'm just trying to think through the \u2013 kind of make sense of the earnings outlook for the balance of the year. So, after this first quarter, I mean, at the midpoint of the full year guidance, it implies lower earnings year-over-year for 2Q, 3Q, 4Q. And I'm just trying to think through where you guys are, what you guys are kind of building in there in a sense, right? Because on one hand, we have revenues that will be up high single digits. Industrial Services should be a good guy year-over-year. But then on the other hand, we're comping some pretty tough construction segment margins. So maybe you could just walk me through those moving parts. Am I thinking about that right? I'm just wondering why it makes sense for earnings to be not up over the balance of the year.\nTony Guzzi: Yes, Sean. So, let's look macro level first. I've been doing this a long time, as has Mark with me. We really tried real hard to think of other than 2019, right?\nMark Pompa: 2019.\nTony Guzzi: And maybe there's one other time. Maybe it was coming from 2010 to 2011. And we couldn't remember where we ever even moved guidance in the first quarter.\nSean Eastman: Yes.\nTony Guzzi: So, start there.\nMark Pompa: The upper end...\nTony Guzzi: The upper end. Okay?\nSean Eastman: Got you. Got you.\nTony Guzzi: Okay. The second thing is you're talking very slight moves in margin to portray the scenario that you're portraying. So, we're not that precise at this time of the year. We'll know a lot more at the end of the second quarter, right, Mark? But we're \u2013 we think we have good guidance right now. And I think we're still trying to work our way around Industrial Services. I mean, we gave up $17 million in the first quarter year-over-year in Industrial Services.\nMark Pompa: Almost $18 million.\nTony Guzzi: Yes, and down 35% on revenues. So, we're not ready to declare victory on that comp yet. Mark, do you have anything to add?\nMark Pompa: Yes. And I think just going to the industrial point, Sean, we're hopeful that it's going to be, as you say, a good guide to 2020. But we still have three quarters of activity to get through with the customer base that if anything has demonstrated that they are reactionary to external factors more than any other customer base that we deal with. So, we would like to think, presuming that we have normal weather patterns, we don't have a hurricane season of note and anything else we could possibly think of, that you would see resumption in demand. But I think Tony has been very clear on this call today, and he certainly was very clear in the February call that we're optimistic that we'll see strengthening in performance in the fourth quarter of 2021, building strength into 2022. And any one or two decisions could easily swing that all into 2022 or conversely back into 2021. And we just don't have the visibility to that yet. So \u2013 and I think the other parts of our business are performing at or near all-time historical highs, both from a margin contribution perspective at fairly high levels of volumes. And that's baked into the guidance. But I think, once again, when we spoke externally in February, we were anticipating that we were going to see some small element of margin degradation in our Electrical and Mechanical Construction businesses. Clearly, we didn't see that in the first quarter, but unfortunately, one quarter does not make a full year. And we're going to endeavor to do whatever we can to maintain or improve those margins. But as we sit here today, it's just too early to predict that we're going to be successful on that front.\nTony Guzzi: Yes. And we operate off of what we know. And I think collectively, we're fairly optimistic right now. But we've been doing this a long time, and we're in the first quarter.\nSean Eastman: Yes \u2013 now that's \u2013 fair. That's helpful perspective. I really appreciate it guys. I'm going to jump over and talk to Bradley now.\nTony Guzzi: Tell him \"Hi\".\nSean Eastman: Take care.\nTony Guzzi: Bye. I think that's it. And...\nOperator: Yes, sir.\nTony Guzzi: Lara, is that it?\nOperator: Yes, sir. That would be our last question.\nTony Guzzi: Okay. Thank you all very much. Appreciate it, and we'll be back to talk to you in July. Bye.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Thank you so much, presenters. And again, thank you, everyone, for participating. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Stay safe and have a lovely day.",

            "name": "Mark Pompa",
            "content": "Thank you, Tony, and my voice thanks you as well. Good morning to everyone participating on the call today. For those accessing this presentation via the webcast, we are now on Slide 7. Over the next several slides, I will augment Tony's opening commentary and review each of our reportable segment's first quarter operating performance as well as other key financial data derived from our consolidated financial statements included in both our earnings release announcement and Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier today. So. let's expand our review of EMCOR's first quarter performance. Consolidated revenues of $2.3 billion are up a modest $4.2 million or 20 basis points over quarter one 2020. Our first quarter results include $29.1 million of revenues attributable to businesses acquired pertaining to the period of time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in last year's first quarter. Acquisition revenues positively impacted each of our United States Electrical Construction, United States Mechanical Construction and United States Building Services segments. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired, first quarter consolidated revenues declined $24.8 million or 1.1% organically. Before reviewing the operating results of our individual reportable segments, I should point out that such results reflect certain reclassifications of prior year amounts due to changes in our internal reporting structure aimed at realigning our service offerings. Most notably, we have transferred our Ardent and Rabalais subsidiaries from our United States Electrical Construction segment to our United States Industrial Services segment. With that being said, I will now review the results of each of our reportable segments, starting with our revenue performance during the quarter. With the exception of United States Industrial Services and United States Electrical Construction, all of EMCOR's reportable segments experienced first quarter revenue growth. United States Electrical Construction quarter one revenues of $456.2 million, decreased $5.6 million or 1.2% from 2020's comparable quarter. Excluding acquisition revenues of $6.5 million, this segment's revenues declined 2.6% organically as revenue reductions within the manufacturing and transportation market sectors were only partially offset by increased project activities within the commercial and institutional market sectors. United States Mechanical Construction revenues of $903.9 million increased $69.8 million or 8.4% from quarter one of 2020. Revenue growth was primarily attributable to an increase in commercial, healthcare and transportation market sector activities due to continued strong demand for our services, partially offset by revenue declines within the manufacturing and institutional market sectors. This substantial quarterly revenue growth was despite a reduction in short-duration project volumes as a consequence of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and represents a new first quarter revenue record for this segment. EMCOR's total domestic construction business first quarter revenues of $1.36 billion, increased $64.2 million or 5% and reflects a strong start to the year. United States Building Services record quarterly revenues of $581.8 million increased $54.2 million or 10.3%. Excluding acquisition revenue contribution of $22.6 million, this segment's revenues increased to $31.6 million or 6% organically. Revenue gains within their commercial site-based services division due to an increase in event-driven snow removal as well as a resumption in project volume as certain customer facilities begin to reopen were the primary drivers in quarter-over-quarter revenue improvement. The segment's mobile mechanical services division additionally experienced stronger project and retrofit demand with an emphasis on services aimed at improving indoor air quality. United States Industrial Services revenues of $235.4 million decreased $128.5 million or 35.3% as this segment continues to be impacted by the negative macroeconomic conditions and uncertainty within the markets in which it operates. Additionally, and as Tony mentioned, the Industrial Services segment was negatively impacted by normal weather conditions and related power outages within the Gulf Coast region, which resulted in the delay of active projects and the deferral of previously planned maintenance and turnaround activities with certain of their customers. Although we were able to assist some of our customers with emergency repairs resulting from the February storm, this unplanned work was not enough to offset the lost quarterly revenue caused by these deferrals and delays. United Kingdom Building Services segment revenues of $126.7 million increased $14.3 million or 12.8% due to growth in project activities across the portfolio as customers began to release projects which were previously on hold due to COVID-19. This segment's results additionally benefited by $9.5 million as a result of the strengthening of the pound sterling, given the lifting of uncertainty around the terms of the United Kingdom's trade deal with the European Union that became effective on January 1, 2021. Please turn to Slide 8. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $224.1 million represent 9.7% of first quarter revenues and reflect a decrease of $2.9 million from 2020. SG&A for the first quarter includes approximately $2.4 million of incremental expenses from businesses acquired inclusive of intangible asset amortization expense, resulting in an organic quarter-over-quarter decline in SG&A of $5.4 million. This organic reduction is primarily attributable to lower employment costs as a result of reduced headcount due to various cost-control measures enacted during 2020 as well as a period-over-period decline in travel and entertainment expenses due to a combination of cost-avoidance measures as well as restricted company travel protocols. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation expense, predominantly within our United States Mechanical Construction segment, due to higher projected annual operating results than what was anticipated during the same prior year period. Reported operating income for the quarter of $117 million compares to $106 million in 2020's first quarter and represents an increase of $11 million or 10.4%. Operating margin of 5.1% has expanded by 50 basis points from the prior year's 4.6% operating margin. This performance reflects a new first quarter operating income and operating margin record for EMCOR. Our United States Electrical Construction segment's operating income of $40.3 million is consistent with 2020's quarter one performance. Reported operating margin of 8.8% represents a 10-basis point improvement over last year's first quarter as a result of a modest increase in this segment's gross profit margin. First quarter operating income of our U.S. Mechanical Construction segment of $65 million increased nearly $20 million from the comparable 2020 period, and operating margin of 7.2% represents a 180-basis point expansion year-over-year. This improved performance is primarily due to greater gross profit across most of the market sectors we serve as a result of both the volume increases previously referenced and a slight improvement in revenue mix as compared to the year-ago period. This segment's operating margin additionally benefited from a reduction in the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to revenues as a result of strong quarterly revenue growth without a commensurate increase in this segment's overhead cost structure. Consistent with the commentary during my revenue discussion, this performance has established a new first quarter record in terms of both operating income and operating margin for our United States Mechanical Construction segment. Our total U.S. construction business is reporting $105.2 million of operating income and a 7.7% operating margin. This performance has improved quarter-over-quarter by $19.7 million or 23.1%. Operating income for our U.S. Building Services segment of $29.3 million is an $8.1 million increase from last year's first quarter, while operating margin of 5% represents a 100-basis point improvement. An increase in gross profit resulting from greater snow removal activities with customers that are contracted on a per snow event basis within the segment's commercial site-based services division and an increase in gross profit from project building controls and repair activities within the segment's mobile mechanical services division were the primary drivers of the quarterly increase in operating income. In addition, the segment's operating income and operating margin benefited from a reduction in SG&A expenses as compared to the prior year due to the various cost-reduction actions instituted subsequent to the first quarter of 2020. This operating income and operating margin performance represent a new first quarter record for this segment. Our U.S. Industrial Services segment operating loss of $2.4 million represents a decline of $17.9 million when compared to operating income of $15.4 million in last year's first quarter. The reduction in period-over-period operating results is due to the previously referenced adverse market conditions, which this segment continues to face as well as the impact of February's extreme winter weather event. In addition, performance of this segment was negatively impacted by lower plant and labor utilization due to significant reduction in revenues. On a positive note, this segment was able to partially offset these negative headwinds with a nearly 21% reduction in first quarter selling, general and administrative expenses due to certain cost savings initiatives enacted in calendar year 2020. UK Building Services operating income of $9.4 million or 7.4% of revenues represents an improvement of $3.6 million and 230 basis points of operating margin expansion over 2020's first quarter. This performance represents an all-time quarterly record for operating income and operating margin as we experienced a strong resumption in project work during the quarter as the United Kingdom market approaches the hopeful conclusion of their COVID-19 lockdown mandates. Additionally, operating income for the quarter benefited from approximately $800,000 of favorable foreign exchange rate movement. We are now on Slide 9. Additional financial items of significance for the quarter not addressed in my previous slides are as follows. Quarter one gross profit of $341.1 million represents 14.8% of revenues, which has improved from the comparable 2020 quarter by $8 million and 30 basis points of gross margin. Both our gross profit and gross profit margin represent new first quarter records for EMCOR despite the significant headwinds we continue to experience within our United States Industrial Services segment. Diluted earnings per common share in the first quarter is $1.54 as compared to $1.35 per diluted share for the prior year period. This $0.19 or 14.1% improvement establishes a new quarter one record for the company and also ties the all-time quarterly diluted earnings per share record, which we previously achieved in quarter four of 2019. We are now on Slide 10. As evident from Slide 10, EMCOR's liquidity profile remains strong. Cash on hand is down from year-end 2020 primarily as a result of cash used in operations due to the funding of 2020's companywide incentive compensation awards as well as the funding of our United Kingdom subsidiaries' VAT deferral from the prior year. Additionally, we repurchased $13 million of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program and utilized nearly $32 million of cash and investing activities, including $24 million to fund the two acquisitions that we completed during the first quarter of this year. Working capital levels have increased modestly primarily due to a reduction in our current liabilities, given a decrease in accounts payable as well as a reduction in accrued payroll and benefits due to the previously mentioned funding of prior year incentive awards, the increase in goodwill as a result of the businesses acquired within our United States Electrical and United States Mechanical Construction segments. Net identifiable intangible assets have decreased as a result of approximately $15 million of intangible asset amortization expense, partially offset by the impact of additional intangible assets recognized in connection with the previously referenced 2021 acquisitions. Total debt, exclusive of operating lease liabilities, is virtually unchanged since year-end 2020. As a result of our consistent outstanding borrowings and the growth in stockholders' equity due to our net income for the quarter, EMCOR's debt-to-capitalization ratio has reduced to 11.5%. Our balance sheet remains pristine and in conjunction with our available credit allows us to invest in our business, return capital to shareholders and execute against our strategic objectives as we navigate through ever-changing market conditions. With my portion of the slide presentation completed, I would like to return the call to Tony. It's all yours, Tony. Yes. So, Brent, just to amplify Tony's commentary, this stuff is fairly quick turn. So, we're getting the award, and we're executing the work within the construct of a quarter. So, you're not going to actually see it hit the RPO number disclosed at the end of the quarter. And what's actually hitting there relative to the huge amount of RPO that EMCOR has as a consolidated enterprise is just not meaningful. With regards to the quarter? Or are you looking at the full year? Full year 2020 or full year 2021? I'm not going to give you 2021. So, I'll give you 2020. So, it's roughly 100... I want to make sure I'd be able to respond to your question. So full year 2020, it's $143 million that's going to move out of Electrical Construction into industrial. No. Tony, you pretty much caught that. Noelle, I think just to echo Tony's point, and I think because we're such a large customer for the wholesalers that we're sourcing from, and we're consistent with where \u2013 how we're procuring our materials, we have \u2013 it's very rare that people do not honor their pricing once we get it. And we obviously strive to get price quotes as close as possible to when we're going to mobilize on work. So, we try to minimize the window of time that we would be exposed to any of that commodity inflationary pressure. But as Tony said, if we do get stung, it would be isolated instances. And it would only impact a quarter and will not prolong itself through the remainder of the year. 2019. The upper end... Almost $18 million. Yes. And I think just going to the industrial point, Sean, we're hopeful that it's going to be, as you say, a good guide to 2020. But we still have three quarters of activity to get through with the customer base that if anything has demonstrated that they are reactionary to external factors more than any other customer base that we deal with. So, we would like to think, presuming that we have normal weather patterns, we don't have a hurricane season of note and anything else we could possibly think of, that you would see resumption in demand. But I think Tony has been very clear on this call today, and he certainly was very clear in the February call that we're optimistic that we'll see strengthening in performance in the fourth quarter of 2021, building strength into 2022. And any one or two decisions could easily swing that all into 2022 or conversely back into 2021. And we just don't have the visibility to that yet. So \u2013 and I think the other parts of our business are performing at or near all-time historical highs, both from a margin contribution perspective at fairly high levels of volumes. And that's baked into the guidance. But I think, once again, when we spoke externally in February, we were anticipating that we were going to see some small element of margin degradation in our Electrical and Mechanical Construction businesses.

But as we sit here today, it's just too early to predict that we're going to be successful on that front."

            "name": "Tony Guzzi",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Kevin. And I'm going to start my discussion on Pages 4 through 6. First, I'd like to welcome you all and what a different feeling we have in late April 2021 than we had in late April 2020 when we were in the throes of understanding of how to operate in a pandemic. I don't have to recount all the areas of uncertainty and turmoil we faced last year, not only at EMCOR, but our country and world writ large. However, at EMCOR, we were able to point to our values of mission first, people always. And they held us together and allowed us to perform at a very high level. These values served as our touch point to have a focus first on the health and safety of our employees. At the same time, we knew we also had to continue to serve our customers as we provided essential services across a range of projects and service calls. And again, like I always like to do, I'd like to thank all of our leaders and employees for their efforts. As demonstrated by our first quarter results, we continue to deliver strong performance by executing well for our customers while focusing on the well-being and safety of our employees. The first quarter of 2021 was an outstanding quarter by any measure. We earned $1.54 per diluted share versus $1.35 in the year-ago period on revenues of $2.3 billion with operating income margins of 5.1%. We had strong revenue growth in Mechanical Construction segment, up 8.4%. We had strong growth in our U.S. Building Services segment, up 10.3% and had strong growth in our UK Building Services segment, up 12.8%. That was aided somewhat by FX. We were essentially flat in our Electrical Construction segment. And as expected, we had a significant decline in revenues of over 35.3% in our Industrial Services segment, which was impacted not only by industry conditions but also the Texas Freeze, which in many cases, pushed out our turnaround schedule into the second quarter of 2021. And the work we did in connection with the freeze could not make up for the shortfall caused by that freeze. We also had a TRIR or a recordable incident rate of under one at 0.92, which was exceptional performance and again, shows our focus on safety and well-being throughout the pandemic, but really that's every day at EMCOR because it's one of our core values. These results, again, show the diversity of EMCOR's business with our ability to pivot to more resilient and stronger markets when some markets like the current downstream refining and petrochemical, oil and gas markets are weakened as a result of reduced demand. As we analyze our first quarter performance, we continue to earn strong operating income margins in our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments. At 8.8% in our Electrical Construction segment and 7.2% in our Mechanical Construction segment, these operating income margins show that we are earning very good conversion on the work that we win, and we are executing well on our contracts, which are largely fixed-price contracts. I intentionally use the word earned in describing these operating income margins. We have tough and demanding customers, who drive a very competitive bidding and selection process. The more complex the work, the more we compete not only on price but also on capability. We have to invest for productivity, not only through tools like BIM or Building Information Modeling prefab, but also better personal protective equipment and hand tools and individual work practices. But we also invest in training and best practice sharing so that we are always learning from each other's to employ the best means and methods for our work. We also must work collaboratively with our supply chain partners, and that is more important than ever as the economy starts back up to make sure that we have the right products at the right place, at the right price across our geography and portfolio of projects. This is especially important on large, complex projects with accelerated time schedules. Our subsidiary and segment leadership teams work hard to perform for our customers every day, and they are among the most skilled teams in our industry. Our U.S. Building Services team had an exceptional quarter, earning 5% operating income margins on 10.3% revenue growth. We had strong performance from mechanical services and both our government and commercial site-based businesses. We continue to have strong demand for mechanical retrofit projects and IAQ or indoor air quality solutions. Our site-based businesses continue to see increased demand for small project work from our total facility management customers. Our leadership from our subsidiaries to the business units to the segments are working well with our customers as they return to more in-office or on-site work. We are a trusted partner as they prepare and operate their facilities to keep their employees safe and improve their employee safety and peace of mind as they return to the workplace in a more significant way. And we do expect that to accelerate in the next few months. Our UK team is performing well and has experienced the same demand drivers and business context as our U.S. Building Services team. At 7.4% operating income margins and revenue growth of 4.5% without the impact of foreign exchange, we are doing very well. We continue to perform well in serving our customers, which have some of the most complex facility services needs in the UK. We also continue to execute well on our project work in the UK. We have a very good team, who are laser-focused on serving their customers well and have earned their customers' trust. Our Industrial Services segment had a tough quarter as expected. We earned positive EBITDA but we're slightly negative on an operating income basis. We have likely made positive operating income in this segment but for the impact of the Texas Freeze, which pushed out the turnaround schedule. We leave the quarter with increased remaining performance obligations or RPOs at $4.77 billion, up from $4.59 billion at year-end 2020, an increase from the year ago level of $4.42 billion. We will discuss our remaining performance obligation trends more later in my remarks. We exit the quarter with a pristine balance sheet. And we are putting that balance sheet to work to build our business and to return cash to our shareholders. With my opening complete, I'll now turn over the conversation to Mark, who will discuss his favorite quarter as he only has to comment on the quarterly performance. Mark? Thanks, Mark, and just for everybody's indication, on the \u2013 at year-end call, I did turn my mic on in time. I'm going to be on Page 11, remaining performance obligations by segment and market sector. So, if I had to sum it up in a lot of ways, in 2020, we had a lot of COVID disruption here in this quarter, the first quarter going to the second. We have a little bit of that left, but for the most part, first quarter 2021, the demand environment and the project bidding for construction and service projects were continuing to be active. As I mentioned earlier, total remaining performance obligations or RPOs at the end of the first quarter were just under $4.8 billion, up $351 million or 7.9% when compared to the year-ago level of $4.4 billion. And RPOs increased $181 million for the first three months of the year from the year-end level of $4.6 billion Our domestic construction segments experienced strong project growth in the quarter, with the RPOs increasing $219 million or 6.1% since the year-ago period of March 31, 2020. All but $15 million of that is organic growth. The $15 million belongs to a Chicago-based electrical contractor that really focuses on infrastructure that joined us in February. Building Services segment RPOs increased in the quarter $121 million or 22% from the year ago quarter, a portion of which was the August 2020 acquisition of a Washington D.C. full-service mechanical contractor. However, more representative of what we are now experiencing in this segment, RPOs grew $60 million or up 10% from December 31. All of that is organic growth. And to paraphrase what I said in February, this work is both the resumption of regularly scheduled mechanical systems maintenance. So, we're maintaining systems that haven't been running full out, and then small project work as a result is coming back in. And then there's modifications and improvements around that on efficiency and indoor air quality. If you go to the right side of that page by market sector, clearly, our largest sector for RPOs continues to be commercial projects. And we're continuing to see strength, and I'll talk about this on the next page, in the resilient sectors that we've highlighted such as data center. And I call it supply chain's buildup for e-commerce delivery and fulfillment. That commercial segment, which also includes the retrofit activity and new build, is 44% of total RPOs. For the year-over-year and sequential quarter-over-quarter comparison, commercial RPOs increased $314 million and $216 million, respectively. The rest of this sector is pretty much netted as in and out as project activity increased a little in some sectors and decreased a little in others. And that's really just the normal ebb and flow of project activity. In general, project interest is favorable in most all sectors with the exception of hospitality that continues to be challenged. As an indication of future market activity, the March ABI came out a week or so ago. And while I think this is a soft index always, it's worked on a board survey from architects and its self-reported numbers. But it's been the same forever, so it's okay. If it's consistently that way, then you can start to draw trends off of it. It jumped over 50, which is expansion territory in February and was over 55 in March. And one of the analysts noted the regional scores, for the most part, were in positive territory, and the general outlook was upbeat. Now that's clearly true from a year-ago period. Correspondingly, the March Dodge Momentum Index, which is an index of nonresidential building projects in planning, also posted a pair of strong gauge in February and March. It's up low double digits at 11% from a year-ago period, pretty much right before the full impact of the pandemic. Look, I think, it's important for me to just take a step back here. First quarter of last year was a good quarter. And until the pandemic came, it was probably one of the best economies that, in my business career, I've ever operated in. So that's the compare that a lot of these numbers are coming off of. So, it's important to know that. And both of these leading indicators are indicators of potential future activity. They're moving in tandem, which is what we like to see. And we do a whole bunch of other analysis, and I'll talk about that later of what we're going to \u2013 what we believe could happen to nonres this year. I'm now going to jump to Page 12, and I'm going to give you a little updated commentary on these resilient sectors that we talk about. If you look at the first two, I'd like to think about that as the build-out of our data infrastructure and our supply chain infrastructure. That's still very strong. It's concentrated in about \u2013 on the data center Side 5 or 6 geographic areas. We're in 60%, 70% of those areas now either electrically or mechanically. We continue to build our data center maintenance business. And on the warehousing side, these are the big million square foot-plus warehouses. For the most part, this is a life safety play for us on the fire protection side. I would argue we are the best in the business at it. Not only are we providing a great solution, we do it cost effectively, and we do it time efficiently. And we got some of the best prefab capability in the industry. We're also doing targeted electrical work depending on the region of the country on these warehouses.  Industrial and manufacturing, it's down a little bit for us right now, but that's really driven by food process, which we have a pretty good pipeline of potential opportunities. But we're actually very bullish on manufacturing because of where we play. We do see supply chain reshoring back to the southeast. That could be either out of Asia, most notably China, or Mexico as people look for redundant supply. I don't think we want to go \u2013 people on their high-margin projects want to be caught in a situation like they were at the beginning of the pandemic, or I do think we're in a decoupling mode versus China as far as supply to the U.S. I think the other part is we are in some good secular markets that we expect to continue, most notably, semiconductors. We are very strong in some of the key markets, whether they be Arizona, which were very strong mechanically. We have a terrific team in Arizona that does this work superbly. This is very difficult work and very complex. And the team we have in Arizona that execute is the best in the business. We also have electrical capability in Utah, which is the Salt Lake City area, which is another one of the semiconductor hubs. And we also have electrical capability in the Pacific Northwest, most notably the Portland area, which is also a semiconductor hub. These are the three major hubs. We have capability in each, and we have great relationships with both our general contractor customers and construction management customers as well as the OEMs and end users. Health care, we continue to see strength. We've made the right acquisitions. You look at the work we'll be doing down in the Georgia market with BKI. You look at the work we'll do in the Houston market with Gowan. You look at the work we'll do \u2013 continue to do in the Midwest with Shambaugh and a combination of companies. And you look at the work we'll continue to do in California. The healthcare market continues to be very strong for us. And I just gave you a couple of markets. We really do this work, broadly speaking, across the country. And we do it both in a retrofit basis, which we expect more and more mechanical and electrical retrofits. And we also see new build coming back in healthcare. Again, this is both a construction opportunity for us and a maintenance opportunity for us. I think one thing people appreciated when they were an EMCOR customer through the pandemic is we can help them make their facilities more flexible when they needed to, to handle patient surges or different kinds of healthcare they needed to deliver. Water and wastewater continues to be a good market for us, especially in Florida. These projects can be lumpy in how they get delivered. We've got one of the best teams in the industry down in Florida, and we're very proud of them. I'll get to the last two, mechanical services, indoor air quality. We're the best in the business at this. The OEMs develop solutions, but they need a company like EMCOR to be able to deliver those solutions. And we deliver these solutions as good or better, and I would say better on a consistent basis than anybody in the industry. That's both the mechanical services, to fix things; indoor air quality, as their whole well building concept becomes more prevalent; and then finally, on efficiency. And we've been the best efficiency people for a long, long time. I would add another sector that sort of overlays this. We will participate in any energy transition. People ask us about that. And clearly, when you have the best pipe fitters and electricians in the business and the people that know how to supervise them, you're going to be part of that. We already are part of it on small-scale solar in a more significant way out in California. The way I think about small-scale solar is the way I thought about distributed generation and cogeneration. That's really what it is in 20 megawatts or less. As you get to the bigger things, we are building capability, especially in Texas right now. We'll see how that goes. I think it's going to go well, and we'll continue to build that capability and anything that the refiners do along the line of carbon capture, it's pipe. And I'm very happy that Exxon and people like Valero are talking more about renewables, renewable diesel and carbon capture. We'll be there to help them do that. So, we feel good about these resilient markets. We don't chase fads at EMCOR. We build capability, and we execute. And we can pivot around these markets, and we've done that over a long period of time. I'm going to finish now on Page 13 and 14. As we entered 2021, let's think about what the context of it was. Vaccinations were just starting to get rolled out. We were in a world of COVID surges in parts of the country. And as February started to come, we gave guidance, but that was our backdrop. But we continued to perform. Our folks are resilient, and they're really good at what they do. In that initial guidance, we gave you about seven, eight weeks ago, we expected to earn $6.20 to $6.70 in earnings per diluted share. And if you look at that midpoint, that would be another record year, Mark, after how many, seven? So pretty good. And we expected to do that on $9.2 billion to $9.4 billion in revenue. And so, we clearly thought that the revenue was going to accelerate as the year went on. And think about the tough compare we're having here in the first quarter with industrial. Up until the third week of March of last year, industrial was having a very good first quarter. So, we went back. We thought about it and we said, okay, we had a better first quarter than we expected. And so, with that, we're going to raise the low end of our guidance range to $6.35. That's a $0.15 movement from the $6.20. And we're going to take the top end of the range up about a $0.05 or $6.75 per diluted share. We're going to keep revenue guidance where it is, and we'll certainly know more about that when we get out of the second quarter. And as we said in February 2021, we did expect 2021 to be another year of outstanding performance. But let's think about this. We have to execute every day. We're doing this across 4,000 projects of size of $250,000 or more. But if you added up all our projects, we're doing this now over about 12,000 projects and service events. And if you take service calls, it's multiples of that. And we have to do that against the backdrop of record operating income margins in our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments in 2020. And we do expect those increased revenues to help us mitigate some of that challenge. So, when we gave you our guidance, we laid out some assumptions. And what I'm going to do now is talk about what that assumption was and what the update on that assumption is now eight weeks later with first quarter in the books. So, the first assumption was our Industrial Services segment, as many of you know, primarily serve the downstream petrochemical and refining markets. We didn't think it would materially improve until the fourth quarter and that it would gain momentum going into 2022 as demand for refined products will continue to be challenged early in 2021, especially through the end of the second quarter. Demand is picking up. So, let's talk about what that view is now. We still believe as far as performance in the segment, that's the accurate view of the market. Some trends are clearly positive now. Crack spreads are very good in high teens. The renewable diesel market is a market we're helping our customers get ready for and serve through upgrades and adaptation of their facilities. And refinery utilization has moved into the low 80s, trending toward the mid-80s. We fully expect that to be in the high 80s by early June. It's going to be driven by really aviation fuel at this point. So, we had an assumption at the beginning of the year also that the nonresidential market would decline modestly. What do we think now? We think that market potentially could be flat for the year. And the second quarter trends will provide more insight as we may see accelerating demand through the year. This market now could have either breakeven performance or modest growth in 2021. We also said that we would continue to execute well on our more resilient market sectors to include manufacturing, commercial driven by data center and logistics warehousing, water and wastewater and all the things I just mentioned on the previous page. We still think that's true and even more true today. And we do expect as the year to go on that manufacturing gains strength, and we'll see it first in our backlog. We did talk about the COVID environment. We did not expect a more restrictive COVID environment than what we were operating in as we gave guidance in February. We did expect a more normal operating environment as the year progressed. We talked about that we were operating near 100% capability. We don't use the word capacity because we always look \u2013 we can add tradespeople. We've learned how to work under these COVID precautions. It does require a lot more planning, and we have to be much more precise in our execution. But you know what? That's sort of how we operate anyway. And it's nothing new for us to keep our employees' safety first. It's one of our core values, and quite frankly, people would not want to work for us if it was not. So, what's my updated view on that? I believe that as we enter third quarter, move through third quarter into fourth quarter, more of our job sites will start to be \u2013 look more normal in conditions in most of the states that we operate in because we continue to see positive trends in those states. And we will see that in the UK, too. I mean, we just talked to our UK folks this morning. 38 million out of 68 million \u2013 66 million people in the UK this morning were operating in parts of the country that had zero COVID cases yesterday reported. I think that might happen here as our vaccinations continue to pick up. We do expect \u2013 we said we expect to continue to help our customers with IAQ, energy efficiency replacement projects, optimizing their systems and helping bring their employees back to work. I would say that's going as expected. So, then you say, \"How do we go from where we are at the low end of the range, the midpoint of the range to the top end of the range?\" I'd say that each one of those trends or mix of those trends get better. So maybe the nonres market's better than we thought it was, especially for projects that can be completed in the year. And that's especially true as things normalize and work normalizes and people start to spend more capital. Our refining and petrochemical customers begin to gain more comfort with improved demand for refined products. And they say, \"Look, instead of trying to bunch all that work into 2022, we start to pull some of that work forward into 2021.\" That would be a logical thing to do. They do worry about manpower in tight \u2013 when they have a bunch of work scheduled. We may be able to have some of those discussions. Momentum in IAQ and efficiency accelerates. That could happen, especially on the efficiency side as folks realize that all the investment in IAQ actually hurts efficiency. And their customers will be demanding them to make their facilities more efficient. And look, we've got to keep our productivity strong as we transition. We want to keep some of those gains we've made with scheduling. We want to keep the emphasis we've had on prefab even on smaller jobs as we transition. I think \u2013 I sort of know we will. But we have to keep that first and foremost in our minds, and of course, we're not going to open the floodgates on travel. Mark talked a little bit about the organic SG& A. That's more positive than you think it is because he had a sentence in there that was pretty key. Think about the outlook we were taking on incentive compensation last year versus this year. We told you we expected to have organic reduction of around $15 million, $20 million. We're at the high end of that right now on a run rate basis. And if we have increased incentive long term, that's a good thing in our field operations because that means we're doing better. The other thing that I know you ask about, and I'll just get in front of it now a little bit is on stimulus. The thing that will impact us this year, the government spending that will impact us this year is all related to these COVID emergency packages. We will benefit from that because of the money that went to the states and municipalities to make their budgets more flushed to allow them to complete some of their smaller capital projects and get some of the transit systems moving again. It will help them think through that and start that. We'll also benefit from some of the spending that's going to go on institutions and schools. Again, go back to this IAQ efficiency and building wellness theme. We're seeing that already. That's what will impact 2021. If this larger infrastructure package of about 50% of the money, give or take, is stuff we could participate in or projects we could potentially participate in, that for the most part is a late 2022, early 2023, likely late 2023, early 2024 event for us. You think about everything that has to happen with a project to get it going. And I think let's all recall late 2008, early 2009. For large-scale infrastructure projects, yes, there's concepts that people want to execute. People don't do detailed design on concept. And so, as we learned back then, there's no such thing as a shovel-ready project. There isn't here either. But one of the things that could be quicker is if we get energy efficiency dollars right and figure out how to flow that out, which, in my mind, would be through the utilities in their programs. The other thing you'll ask about is labor. Look, we're sort of at the top end of that food chain. That's not something that we had issues with. I do think I'm glad I'm not a painter or a roofer or a cleaner right now because there is headwinds about hiring labor at the low end, especially with the enhanced employment benefit \u2013 unemployment benefit. It requires us \u2013 also on the factory side, we're lucky to be who we are because we can, like I said earlier, work closely with our supply chain partners and work real hard to mitigate the impact because they're also having difficulty ramping up. And you probably heard that on all the calls with the manufacturers. I'm sure you did. When we get to capital allocation, we had a lot of detail on that in our year-end discussions. Our guidance contemplates that we will continue to be disciplined capital allocators. And we'll do that between organic growth, which we love to fund; acquisitions; share repurchases; and dividends. We're on track to meeting \u2013 toward meeting that goal this year. This year, we've already done three acquisitions. We have a very good pipeline. Those may be moving a little slower as we try to understand the impact of pandemic on operations, but we'll get through that. And we feel very good about our pipeline right now. And with that, Lara, I'll take questions. Thank you for your interest in EMCOR, and we'll turn the call over to you. Good morning, Brent. Yes. I think it's way too early for us to think it could help the margins. We're pretty happy where our margins are right now. But it will be interesting, the push and pull of will we be able to keep some of this enhanced scheduling. In some cases, we will. Some cases, we won't. Will we be able to work swing shifts without a lot of pay differential? I think some of our folks have started to like that because they like not being on a crowded job site, and they like being more productive. And then they can put pressure back on their \u2013 the union and others to help us do that. So, I think it's too early to tell. I think there are some hard-wired things that we'll benefit from. Our folks have got better and better at planning just the things we control. And they've gotten better and better even on the smaller jobs of using prefabrication and trying to get the work off the site. So hopefully, we can keep productivity where it is. That's our plan, and maybe we can pick up a little bit. Nothing has risen to the level where people are calling me to reach out to the Chief Executive Officer of a distributor, which I've done in the past, or a Chief Executive Officer of an OEM. So that means we're relatively getting through our normal mechanism what we need to stay productive on a job. I'm not sure that's true for everybody, but you think about who EMCOR is in a local market. We're known as being a very fair partner to deal with. We pay people. We pay them on time. We work with them and do a lot of preplanning, especially on the large jobs. We're innovative. We think about ways to have our suppliers help us to the point we work a lot on inventory management together. We try not to have them be surprised. And then, of course, we have big relationships. And we also tend to be pragmatic business people. Sometimes, we don't go for the last dollar on a negotiation because assurance of supply to us, when your workforce is as expensive as ours, is way more important than the extra nickel on a roll of wire or a line of \u2013 a foot of pipe. Yes, I'm going to ask Mark to help me with this. But the reality is it will probably never meaningfully affect the RPOs. What it does is it meaning affect growth in a quarter in Building Services because most of this is work \u2013 RPOs for us, for the most part, is projects that stick around through a quarter. This work tends to be in and out and tends to be smaller ticket item. And Brent, we don't talk a lot about this. But I got to give our folks a lot of credit on this one. Back last year, four weeks before we're sitting here today, as early as March 30 of last year, we were gearing up to be able to deliver these solutions. And we had all the relationships. This was part of our arsenal of things we would deliver to a customer. But some of this was these tools, because it hurts efficiency, people weren't that excited about. I got to give a lot of credit to Mike Bordes and his team. They took advantage of the downtime with a lot of our technicians. And they took advantage with our salespeople and our service supervisors and our small project managers. And we did a ton of training from about March 25 of last year until June one when we could really go back out and offer these solutions. And you had to have all the OEM relationships in place. You had all the supply chain in place. We also had to have the front end trained so people could go and implement. And so, we were thinking about this, I'm venturing to say, long before other people to be able to deliver. And we were proactive with our customers and not reactive. Thank you. Mark will take that. We just want to make sure you're on your toes, Adam. Look, like we always say, and probably much to ad nauseam for all of you, these aren't quarter-to-quarter businesses. But for those that have been with us a long time that we're consistently operating in the UK north of 5% now three years in a row. It might be 7% one quarter. It might be 4.9% one quarter. But if we can keep that between the goalpost of 5% to 6% on an annual basis, we're doing pretty well. And what really drove it was the project mix. And if that continues and again, this is not pricing. This is execution, and this is really, really good work. Look, we always have some food processing work, but the large project work, the large project we were doing is pretty much through commissioning now. We have other things on the board. And the way this works is you have a lot of contingencies and really complex projects on commissioning. So, we're starting to move through some of those contingencies. But let's be clear, that's not what \u2013 the only thing that drove that performance. This was across a lot of work, a lot of projects. Mark also made a comment that unless you're really listening, you might have not picked up on. We had those \u2013 that increased revenue with very little increased cost. And so, at the end of the day, we're getting good fall-through because, again, go to the productivity point. We're probably benefiting more from productivity in our mechanical segment because of what they're doing on prefab and planning than in any part of EMCOR, especially in our \u2013 we like to call them the power companies. But what I mean by that, these are large subsidiaries. They really have got this down right now. And then Joe Burns and his team are probably as good as anybody at taking those means and methods and spreading them through the company where applicable. I'll tell you how we really feel, Adam. Good morning Noelle. How are you? Good. Look, if not handled correctly, within a quarter or two, that could be a direct impact. We \u2013 again, go back to the supply chain discussion I had. We work really hard on large projects to try to lock in the best we can, the prices, especially on the major components, gear, chillers, air handlers, all that typically gets locked in. And we're not speculators in that. We make our price, we figure it out, and that's what we go with. We also don't run. So, when we talk about being fair, right? Typically, our guys don't run back if the price moves down to those suppliers and say, \"Okay, now I need a reduction.\" We made our deal. And of course, now in more commodity inflationary times, they realize that. The other thing is most of our work is getting repriced, and in a sense, this smaller project work, this stuff that's less than a couple of million, all the time. What I mean by that is we're doing new work, right? So therefore, we reprice it. We were talking about this, Mark and I, as this round of commodity inflation would be, for him and I, probably about the seventh time we've seen this, eighth time together. Yes, together. We've seen it more than that, but together, we've seen it. Many years ago, I was on the other side of this, trying to ramp through price increases. We really have not been stung bad by this through time. We know the copper game. Our electrical Chief Executive Officers are as good as an estimator as good as anybody in the business as our mechanical guys. I'll make \u2013 I'll go out on a limb here. I might end up being wrong. I doubt it on this one. Steel prices will come down because capacity will come back online. Steel guys typically can't help themselves. We will not be three times what we were before this pandemic of flat cold-rolled as we are today. That won't be the case. And our guys also \u2013 we internally have a very good team that makes sure that our folks know the trends in commodities are coming. You say, \"Okay, how does a company like EMCOR get that?\" It's not like we have a group of economists. Best I got is Kevin and someone that works for him. So, I mean, these are not folks who spend their time analyzing them. How we get good at it is we have great relationships with our distributor partners. And they try to keep us in front of what they're seeing on the things they're buying. And again, all the people always say, \"What's the benefits of scale?\" That information, that knowledge is a huge benefit of scale. And then finally, I'd offer, Noelle, just to sort of break out for you that how \u2013 where we really are. If you take the mechanical business, 45%, 55% of a job can be materials and equipment depending on whether we buy it or the customer does on some of the big systems. And on the electrical side, that's closer to 35% to 45% of materials, and the balance is labor. That's for the mechanical and electrical segments. You get to Building Services, a little less because of the time and material nature of repair service and the labor-based component of our repair projects and our service agreements and our site-based business. Mechanical service business, give or take, is about 50-50 equipment to labor. And as you go to Industrial Services, it's 80-10 \u2013 80-20 I mean. And the only thing, the reason it gets to 20% on materials is the work we do on the shop. And remember, most of our materials in the shop are customer provided on the big stuff. They're buying the tubes and stuff. So, our exposure on materials are really in the electrical and mechanical segments. And our guys keep in front of that pretty good. And if we have a blip or exposed, it's very short. Mark, do you have anything to add? I mean, the answer to the EMCOR-specific is on the projects that EMCOR will bid, on the projects that EMCOR will win, and that will be an increase to what we're doing today, which is we think, again, go back to what I said, even without this infrastructure bill, we expect non-res to maybe have a growth year versus what was an expected down year this year. EMCOR won't take a job unless we have the capacity to do it. And we believe we will have the capacity to grow if that infrastructure bill comes into the market. It will be a meaningful part of the industry, and it will cause the industry to grow. And we typically outgrow the industry. Second to that, will the industry be able to absorb it? I think the answer to that's yes. I think \u2013 like the industry always struggles at the low end. Somehow, we'll find a way to get through that. Where we're at, again, I always use this example. I can't worry about what all my competitors do, but I'll tell you how we think about it. We think we're a destination of choice for trade labor. And why is that? Go back to that discussion we had on safety. It's a core value. We give people the right equipment. They know that, that's fundamental to who we are. The second thing is, they know they're going to have confident supervision. You need \u2013 and that's all the way up, right? These three people I'm sitting around the table with today, including four with me, we all have deep, deep respect and have a pretty good knowledge of the challenges skilled trade labor focus on and have to do in execution of their job. It gets better as you go down because now, you're getting more technical, and they're led by people that know how to help them do their job. That's really important. The third thing is they know they're going to get paid. That's \u2013 it sounds simple. But if you work for a smaller contractor, that may or may not happen in a given week. And the fourth thing is, if they do a good job for us, really there's only two or three places in the country where the union says, \"Hey, you need to take these people or you need to rotate these people up.\" We pick our workforce. We have rights over that, and they know that they could become part of our \"permanent workforce\" and always have a job. You put those \u2013 and with EMCOR's leadership position in most markets, you put those four things together, I don't think we'll have trouble finding that labor, but others might. And \u2013 but that's no different than any other upmarket that we're in. I will say one of the things that would be helpful, and I actually think it will be one of the positives, right, is the labor department is actually being run by somebody right now that really understands skilled labor training. And we'll see if he can make that successful. I mean, look, their multiples might drift up a half a turn or a turn, but so does ours, right, even more than that. And so, we'll still have the same disciplined process we always have. And we could show you a slide and you go, \"Wow. You actually got to seal all those deals?\" It starts with 200, and then it goes to 50, and then it goes to 20, and then it goes to five, and we may close three, right? But at the end of the day, I'm not looking at 200. We have folks that look at books maybe or reach out to owners or owners call us. We have a pretty good idea of the kind of companies we want to buy and who they are. We work with them over a long period of time. Where we're best is when someone's selling their life's work or their family's life's work, and they still want to be part of the solution going forward. We're not looking to make the best financial deal. What I mean by that is we're not bargained \u2013 just like I talked about how we're fair with our suppliers, we look to be fair with the people selling us their business. They're going to be our partners going forward. Secondarily, we want to make sure that we both buy into the business case and what it looks like going forward. So private \u2013 if it's a big auction run by some of the notorious banks that are going to do narrow, and narrow to them means 150 people looking at it, we're probably not going to be successful. And in fact, I'm not even sure we look at much of that anymore. A lot of times, people will hire intermediary. But their intermediaries hire to get to us and to put structure around the process. And a lot of times, we're at the top of that list. And like I said, we try to be very fair on terms and conditions, and we try to be very fair on price that works for both of us. And you think about what we've done and you say, \"Wow, I didn't know you did that.\" We've done five deals since May of last year through a pandemic. Now none of them have been earshots. We've been pretty good, though. And we see nothing that will abate us from doing that or more, and there might be even larger ones coming in there, which means bigger contractors that we know for a very long period of time, and they have terrific reputations. And we got just sort of delayed a little bit with the pandemic. Mark or Kevin? Mark, you have anything to add? Anything else? Lara? Yes, Sean. So, let's look macro level first. I've been doing this a long time, as has Mark with me. We really tried real hard to think of other than 2019, right? And maybe there's one other time. Maybe it was coming from 2010 to 2011. And we couldn't remember where we ever even moved guidance in the first quarter. So, start there. The upper end. Okay? Okay. The second thing is you're talking very slight moves in margin to portray the scenario that you're portraying. So, we're not that precise at this time of the year. We'll know a lot more at the end of the second quarter, right, Mark? But we're \u2013 we think we have good guidance right now. And I think we're still trying to work our way around Industrial Services. I mean, we gave up $17 million in the first quarter year-over-year in Industrial Services. Yes, and down 35% on revenues. So, we're not ready to declare victory on that comp yet. Mark, do you have anything to add? Yes. And we operate off of what we know. And I think collectively, we're fairly optimistic right now. But we've been doing this a long time, and we're in the first quarter. Tell him \"Hi\". Bye. I think that's it. And... Lara, is that it? Okay. Thank you all very much. Appreciate it, and we'll be back to talk to you in July. Bye."

My opening comments will cover Pages 4 through 6. I'm going to direct my comments towards our full year 2022 performance. And Mark will focus his remarks on both our fourth quarter and full year 2022 performance.  My only comments with respect to the fourth quarter of 2022 are that it was a record quarterly performance for revenues, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations and operating cash flow. We had an exceptional year in 2022 in a challenging environment. We earned revenues of $11.1 billion, with 11.8% revenue growth and 10.3% organic revenue growth. We executed well with a 5.1% operating income margin and generated exceptional operating cash flow of $498 million. We had strong SG&A leverage at 9.4% of sales, and all of that culminated in record earnings per diluted share of $1 -- of $8.10 per share.  During 2022, we faced some strong headwinds, including supply chain challenges, COVID disruptions and material and labor inflation. We adapted both our service and project pricing and planning to adjust for inflation and the inefficiencies caused by supply chain issues. As a result, after a tough first quarter, our financial performance improved as the year progressed, demonstrating our success in mitigating such challenges.  Our Mechanical Construction segment had an exceptional year with 9.5% revenue growth, all of which was organic and an operating income margin of 7.7%. This segment had excellent execution in the commercial market sector, especially in the area of high-tech manufacturing, with a focus on semiconductors and data centers. This segment additionally benefited from strength in the water and wastewater sectors and the health care market. We enhanced our capabilities in BIM, or Building Information Modeling and prefabrication, which allowed us to continue to deliver our services to our customers in a more productive, high-quality and safe manner.  We also continue to deliver exceptional fire-life safety projects, where we have earned our customers' confidence that we can deliver the most sophisticated technical solutions in the most demanding markets. Our portfolio of projects included semiconductor manufacturing plants, large distribution facilities, data centers as well as those for pharma and bio life science industries.  In summary, we had an excellent year in our Mechanical Construction segment and have a solid foundation for continued success.  Our Electrical Construction segment's performance strengthened through the year as expected and we finished the year more in line with our historical performance and expectations. This segment generated revenues of $2.43 billion and had very strong revenue growth of 19.9% for the year with 13.2% organic revenue growth.  Operating income margin was 6.1%, and we experienced continued excellent performance in the commercial sector, including the data center and semiconductor markets. This segment additionally benefited from greater demand within the health care market sector, and we continue to strengthen and build out our low-voltage service offering. Our Electrical Construction business continues to be a market leader and is positioned well going into the future.  Our U.S. Building Services segment had an exceptional year, driven by excellent performance across the majority of our service lines, including repair service, site-based services, building controls and HVAC projects. This segment earned revenues of $2.72 billion and delivered a 5.3% operating income margin. Revenue growth was 12.2% with organic revenue growth of 11.6%.  Our performance strengthened through the year as we had more precise pricing to offset material and fuel price increases and we became better at planning around difficult supply chain issues, driving demand for our services, our energy prices, which continue to be volatile and costly. This has created the need for enhanced energy efficiency and an uncertain supply chain, which has created the need to extend the life of our customers' mechanical equipment through repair services.  Customers are also demanding more efficient, proactive and integrated facilities management solutions that not only provide more self-performance of the most technical trades, but also provide the best vendor-managed solutions for cleaning, landscaping and other less technical trades. We have a very strong customer base with increased needs for our services, and we are delivering for our customers.  Our Industrial Services segment generated revenues of $1.12 billion which represents 13.4% revenue growth, all of which was organic. We continue to experience the resumption of normal demand for our services, which began in the second half of 2021. We have seen increased demand for turnaround in shop services related to the support of our customers' downstream operations. However, demand for our services supporting our upstream customers remains challenged.  Further, our renewable project activity remains muted as a result of the nonavailability of required materials to support large-scale solar installations. We expect to continue to see the segment recover more broadly to more normal operations and demand and expect demand and performance to continue to incrementally improve.  Despite foreign exchange headwinds, our U.K. Building Services segment had another strong year with operating income margins up 6.3%. Our team continues to deliver for some of the most sophisticated customers in the United Kingdom. We exited the year with $7.5 billion in RPOs versus $5.6 billion at the end of 2021, representing a 33% year-over-year increase. From a market perspective, we experienced the largest growth in RPOs within the commercial market sector. This includes both traditional commercial construction projects as well as our telecommunication/data center work and our high-tech manufacturing project such as EV and battery plants, semiconductor, biotech and life sciences.  These are important areas for EMCOR. And as a result of the continued growth, we will expand our RPO and revenue disclosures beginning in 2023 to provide greater insight into these sectors. And then beyond that commercial market sector, we see -- we saw RPO growth from the majority of the remaining markets in which we operate, including the health care, manufacturing, institutional and hospitality and gaming market sectors. We will discuss RPOs in more detail following Mark's commentary.  Our balance sheet remains liquid and strong and will continue to support our organic growth as well as our capital investment, acquisitions and return of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  During 2022, we completed 6 acquisitions, 5 tuck-ins to existing subsidiaries which bolster the capabilities of our Electrical, Mechanical and Building Services segments.  With that, I'll turn the discussion of our results over to Mark.\nMark Pompa: Thank you, Tony, and good morning to everyone participating on the call today. For those accessing this presentation via the webcast, we are now on Slide 7.  Over the next several slides, I will provide a detailed discussion of our fourth quarter 2022 results as well as a summary update of our full year performance, some of which Tony outlined during his opening commentary. As a reminder, all financial information discussed during this morning's call is included in our consolidated financial statements within both our earnings release announcement and Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier today.  So let's begin our Q4 commentary. Consolidated revenues of $2.95 billion are up $309.6 million or 11.7% from the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding $33.7 million of incremental revenues attributable to businesses acquired, pertaining to the time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in last year's quarter, revenues for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased approximately $276 million or 10.5% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.  Most of our reportable segments experienced strong revenue growth during the quarter, establishing a new all-time quarterly revenue record for EMCOR, specific segment performance is as follows: United States Electrical Construction revenues of $713.6 million increased to $166.2 million or 30.4% from quarter 4 2021. Excluding incremental acquisition revenues, this segment's revenues grew a strong 24.2% organically quarter-over-quarter. Increased project activity within the commercial market sector, inclusive of data center and technology projects as well as revenue growth within the health care and manufacturing market sectors were the primary drivers of the quarter-over-quarter revenue increase.  United States Mechanical Construction segment revenues of $1.14 billion, increased $77.4 million or 7.3% from quarter 4 2021. Revenue growth during the quarter was concentrated within both the commercial and institutional market sectors. With respect to the commercial market sector, we are continuing to benefit from increased project activity from our data center customers as well as growth within the high-tech submarket sector, driven by various semiconductor construction projects.  In terms of the institutional market sector, we experienced increased revenues as a result of various HVAC repair and replacement projects being performed across a number of geographies where we serve schools, universities and other educational customers who are continuing to deploy funding that was received under the CARES Act. These substantial revenue gains were muted by revenue declines in the manufacturing, health care and transportation market sectors quarter-over-quarter due to the completion or substantial completion of certain large projects which were active in the prior year period.  Both our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments established new all-time quarterly revenue records with their fourth quarter performance. Revenues of EMCOR's combined to domestic construction segments totaled $1.86 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of $243.6 million or 15.1%, with 13% of such revenue growth being organic.  Consistent with the last several quarters, we continue to be successful in winning new work to replace those projects, which are being completed as evidenced by the growth in the remaining performance obligations of these segments year-over-year. As is customary and as Tony previously commented, he will continue the RPO discussion at the conclusion of my financial commentary.  United States Building Services quarterly revenues of $704.2 million increased $83.9 million or 13.5%. Quarterly revenue growth was generated across all of the segment's operating divisions with the most significant growth being generated by the Mechanical Services and commercial site-based services divisions.  Within Mechanical Services, we benefited from strong demand for HVAC retrofit projects and building automation and control services with an emphasis on improving building efficiency, energy consumption and indoor air quality. We continue to assist our customers with their decarbonization efforts and the implementation of plans or programs to come back escalating operating costs. In addition, we continue to experience growth in service repair and maintenance volumes as persisting supply chain delays have resulted in the need to extend the useful lives of in-place HVAC equipment in instances when new equipment is not readily available.  With respect to the segment's commercial site-based services division, customer additions as well as scope or site expansion and increased project activity with existing customers were the drivers of the quarterly increase in revenues.  EMCOR's Industrial Services segment revenues of $276.2 million decreased to $7.4 million or 2.6% with refinery utilization in excess of 90% and continued pressure on refiners to maintain or increase downstream output, we are experiencing deferrals and delays of planned maintenance work as our energy clients seek to minimize facility downtime. This has additionally led to a reduction in pull-through repair project opportunities.  United Kingdom Building Services revenues of $113.3 million decreased $10.5 million. This revenue contraction was entirely due to unfavorable exchange rate movements for the GBP versus the USD which is masking revenue growth on a local currency basis as this segment experienced elevated project demand from its customers.  Please turn to Slide 8. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $277.6 million represent 9.4% of revenues and compares to $260 million or 9.8% of revenues in the year ago period. The current year's quarter includes approximately $5.1 million of incremental expenses from businesses acquired, inclusive of intangible asset amortization, resulting in an organic quarter-over-quarter increase in SG&A of $12.5 million. This quarter's organic growth in SG&A expenses is primarily related to personnel costs, due to both increased headcount to support our strong organic revenue growth as well as higher quarterly incentive compensation expense due to improved year-over-year performance at certain of our operating companies.  Despite the growth in SG&A dollars and consistent with our performance throughout the year, we have seen a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of revenues as we continue to successfully leverage our cost structure. As I mentioned over the last several quarters, we continue to remain disciplined with overhead investment and are seeking incremental efficiencies of scale as we continue to drive revenue growth.  Reported operating income for the quarter of $177.2 million compares to operating income of $143 million in 2021 fourth quarter and establishes a new all-time quarterly operating income record for EMCOR. Our consolidated operating margin of 6% represents a 60 basis point improvement from 2021's fourth quarter and continues our trend of sequential quarterly operating margin improvements in 2022 after a slow start in the first quarter.  Specific quarterly performance by segment is as follows: our U.S. Electrical Construction segment operating income of $58.1 million, increased $16.3 million from the comparable 2021 period and reported operating margin of 8.1% represents an improvement from the 7.6% in last year's quarter. These increases were a result of increased gross profit in gross profit margin within the commercial, health care and manufacturing market sectors, given a more favorable revenue mix. In addition, the increase in operating margin was partially attributable to a decrease in the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to revenues during the current year period.  This improved Electrical Construction segment performance was achieved despite certain discrete project write-downs totaling $10 million during the fourth quarter of 2022, which negatively impacted the segment's operating margin by 140 basis points. As referenced last quarter, we continue to evaluate our contractual rights on these projects and are pursuing recovery where permitted.  Fourth quarter operating income of United States Mechanical Construction Services segment of $105.7 million represents a $12 million increase from last year's quarter and operating margin of 9.3% represents a 50 basis point improvement from the strong 8.8% earned a year ago. From an operating income perspective, the period-over-period increase was largely a result of incremental gross profit contribution from those commercial market sector projects referenced during my revenue commentary.  With respect to operating margin, improved project performance, coupled with the reduction in SG&A as a percentage of revenues were the primary drivers of the quarter-over-quarter increase.  Operating income for U.S. Building Services was $37 million or 5.3% of revenues, which represents a $10.8 million or 41.2% increase period-over-period with a 110 basis point expansion in operating margin. The growth in both operating income and operating margin is due to improved fourth quarter performance within the segment's mechanical services, commercial site-based services and government services divisions. Notably, we experienced better project execution as well as a more favorable mix of work. This improved performance additionally reflects our continued focus on project pricing and disciplined cost management.  Our U.S. Industrial Services segment operating income of $1.5 million represents a $2.5 million reduction from the $4 million of operating income reported in 2021's fourth quarter. Such decline is due to a less favorable revenue mix as we experienced limited scope growth from projects being performed by this segment's field services operations during the 2022 fourth quarter. This also resulted in a reduction in pull-through equipment repairs for our shop services operations.  As I mentioned during my revenue commentary, minimization of equipment downtime has become a primary focus of this segment's customers, given the market conditions within the oil and gas industry.  U.K. Building Services operating income in 2022's fourth quarter of approximately $4.5 million is down moderately and operating margin of 3.9% is essentially flat when compared to that of the prior year quarter. From an operating income perspective, the reduction in U.S. dollars is entirely due to unfavorable exchange rate movements excluding the impact of foreign exchange, this segment's operating income increased as a result of the growth in project volumes referenced during my revenue commentary, as their customers continue with their capital spending programs.  We are now on Slide 9. Additional financial items of significance for the quarter not addressed in the previous slides are as follows. Quarter 4 gross profit of $454.8 million is higher than the comparable prior year quarter by $51.8 million or 12.8%. Gross margin of 15.4% has improved over last year's quarter and represents our highest reported gross margin for any quarterly period in 2022. This increase in gross margin when compared to 2021 fourth quarter as well as the sequential improvement throughout 2022 is due to the performance of our U.S. Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments as well as our U.S. Building Services segment as referenced during my segment operating income commentary.  Diluted earnings per common share in the fourth quarter of 2022 is $2.63 compared to $1.89 per diluted share for the prior year quarter. This fourth quarter EPS performance eclipses EMCOR's prior all-time quarterly record, which was established in the third quarter of 2022.  Please turn to Slide 10. With my fourth quarter commentary complete, I will now augment Tony's introductory remarks on EMCOR's annual performance. Consolidated revenues of $11.1 billion represent an increase of $1.17 billion or 11.8% when compared to 2021. Our full year results include $149.7 million of incremental revenues attributable to businesses acquired pertaining to the period of time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in 2021.  Excluding the impact of acquisitions, annual revenues increased 10.3% organically with all of our reportable segments generating double-digit or near double-digit organic revenue growth other than our United Kingdom Building Services segment due to negative foreign exchange rate movements during 2022, which have been referenced several times.  As a result of our performance over the last 3 quarters of this year, our full year operating income of $564.9 million surpassed the $530.8 million reported in 2021. Operating margin of 5.1% for 2022 compares to 5.4% in the prior year despite the 30 basis point reduction in operating margin, 2022's performance reflects excellent operational execution given the external market headwinds encountered during the year.  Full year diluted earnings per share is $8.10 and represents an increase of $1.04 or 14.7% over 2021's diluted EPS of $7.06. The combination of year-over-year net income growth with the reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding, given our share repurchase activity during 2022 has contributed to a new annual diluted EPS record for the company.  We are now on Slide 11. EMCOR's balance sheet remains strong and liquid, and we are well positioned to fund organic growth, return capital to shareholders and pursue strategic M&A investments. Fluctuations of note within our balance sheet when compared to December of 2021 are as follows: despite strong operating cash flow during the year of $498 million, our cash balance has declined from year-end 2021, as we're investing in financing outflows exceeded operating cash inflows. Notably, we utilized $660.6 million for the repurchase of our common stock, have spent a net $98.7 million on acquisitions and returned just over $27 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends. Resulting primarily from the decrease in cash, coupled with an increase in our net contract liability position, our working capital balances decreased by approximately $321 million. The impact of these items were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable, given the revenue growth we've experienced.  The $28.9 million increase in Goodwill since December of 2021 was entirely a result of the 6 acquisitions completed by us during calendar 2022. Net identifiable intangible assets have increased marginally period-over-period as the additional intangible assets recognized in connection with the aforementioned acquisitions were largely offset by amortization expense during the year.  Total debt, exclusive of operating lease liabilities has decreased by $14.5 million, largely as a result of the $13.9 million required principal payment made on our term loan in December of 2022. Our shareholders' equity balance has reduced by just under $279 million as our shareholder return activities, including common stock repurchases and dividend payments have exceeded our net income for the year. EMCOR's debt-to-capitalization ratio has increased to 11.1% from 10.4% at year-end 2021, given the reduction in our shareholders' equity just referenced.  As we stated before, our balance sheet in conjunction with the borrowing capacity available to us under our credit agreement will continue to enable us to invest in our business, return capital to shareholders and execute against our strategic objectives as we progress through 2023 in future periods. Our commitment to shareholder return is evidenced by both our share repurchase activity to date as well as today's announcement that our Board of Directors has approved an increase in our quarterly dividend of 20%.  With my portion of this morning's slide presentation completed, I would now like to return the call to Tony. Tony?\nAnthony Guzzi: Thanks, Mark, and I'm on Page 12, remaining performance obligations by segment and market sector. The fourth quarter of 2022 saw our ninth consecutive quarter of RPO growth. Momentum continues. We experienced healthy project demand throughout 2022 across all our segments and most of the market sectors that we participate in. If I look back a year, the company grew RPOs by $1 billion in 2021 and in 2022. As a result, our position and our market position has strengthened even more.  Total company RPOs at the end of 2022 were approximately $7.5 billion, up nearly $1.9 billion or 33%, over the December 2021 total of $5.6 billion. Additionally, fourth quarter project bookings were likewise strong, increasing $358 million in the final 3 months of the year. All but approximately $160 million of which, and that's associated with our August acquisition of Boston-based Gas and Electric.  As a side note, they have a terrific market position and dynamic leadership team that fits well with our EMCOR operating style and values. The rest of that growth was all organic. Again, for 2022, velocity in the business remained strong, with both revenue and total RPOs growing double digits from the previous year ago period.  While our continued growth of RPOs is largely due to the strength of demand for our services, a small portion of this increase can likely be attributed to external factors, such as material and labor inflation as well as supply chain delays, which elongate some of our projects.  Our 2 domestic construction segments experienced strong construction project growth year-over-year, with RPOs increasing just over $1.5 billion or 34% from December 2021. The Mechanical Construction segments saw RPOs increase by $737 million or 23%, while the Electrical Construction segment saw an increase of $789 million or a strong 64%. Much of this increase is continued demand for hyperscale data centers, industrial manufacturing facilities and semiconductor, life sciences and health care facilities.  U.S. Building Service RPO levels increased $279 million or 32% in 2022 and totals almost $1.15 billion in small to midsized project and service work. Like all of 2022, this quarter saw continued project awards in its Mechanical Services division and the award or renewal of several facilities maintenance contracts in our site-based services division.  EMCOR Industrial Services and our U.K. Building Services business while having less RPO-type projects supporting their business still saw their RPO totals for 2022 increase 12% and 36%, respectively. I should mention that over $42 million RPO increase in the U.K. business came despite unfavorable exchange rates against the dollar.  Moving to the right side of the page, we show RPOs broken down by market sector. Commercial RPOs grew 51% year-over-year, and I'm going to come back to this in greater detail on the next slide. Looking at the other market sectors, year-over-year growth, health care RPOs, 40%; institutional RPO, 21%; industrial manufacturing RPOs, up 22% and short-duration projects, which include work that our HVAC and controls retrofit work repair and service project work and low voltage work, up 15%. Partially offsetting the increase was a reduction in transportation and water and wastewater RPOs, which is booked in a much more episodic manner.  For greater transparency and on Page 13, we're going to break out commercial RPOs into the 3 large subsectors that we believe make up our commercial RPOs. Going forward into 2023, we will expand our RPO and revenue disclosures beginning to provide greater insight into these 3 sectors for our investors. So from bottom to top. The dark green section of the bar shows traditional commercial RPOs. It includes a lot of work in buildings and campuses, warehouses, mixed-use facilities, educational facilities and some retail. We have seen growth in traditional commercial RPOs over time, really from the result of energy savings projects and also strong fire protection and life safety project retrofits and new builds at various logistics facilities and other facilities across the country.  Going up the slide into the middle gray section, telecommunications, which is network and communications infrastructure projects, including data centers, data, fiber and cabling projects. Much of the growth here has been driven by hyperscale data centers, projects, but also the growth in our low-voltage business. The top right section of the bar is called high-tech projects. High-tech manufacturing and R&D facilities. Here, we capture projects in the semiconductor, biotech, life sciences, pharmaceutical, electric vehicle and EV battery and EV facilities -- and EV battery facilities.  As the slide shows, we have a strong base of traditional commercial projects. More specifically, the slide shows that our recent commercial growth has been concentrated in the other 2 sectors which represents 75% of our year-over-year commercial RPO growth. These are important subsectors for the company going forward, and we will expand our RPO and revenue disclosures beginning this year to provide greater insights into these important subsectors.  So look, in summary of the RPO section, we're busy. We're quoting work, our RPO level is high, demand for our service is high, and we continue to see an active pipeline of new projects. Given where we are, and we're going to make all the carve-outs in the last section of all the economic factors we don't control. We believe we have good visibility as we start out 2023.  We have good work in our RPOs. We have strong inquiries, and we have demand in the market sectors where we see momentum and where we execute well. And we have some of the best teammates and leaders on the ground and that allows us as a senior leadership team to be confident in our ability to complete the work we currently have and what we will win in 2023.  Now I'm going to turn to Slide 14, and it's a slide we've discussed a lot over the last 2 years. And it's a slide I love because it talks about trends in our business that have been good long-term trends in sectors that we performed very well. And what I'm going to do is talk about some crosscutting issues and also some specific sectors. We've been talking about data centers for a while, and we added semiconductor fabs and other high-tech manufacturing. We are very well positioned in data centers. In fact, I would argue we can do that work mechanically, electrically in fire protection as well or better than any contractor in the market, and we deliver great value for our customers.  We also deliver across a whole suite of our trades in the data center market from electrical, low-voltage, mechanical and fire protection. We do the same thing in semiconductor fabrication. We believe that's a market that while growing, and we'll talk about some of the things with recent legislation that's going to help it accelerate maybe a little bit but it was a good trend.  And in semiconductor fab in our estimation and in the market's estimation, our customers, this has less to do with new demand, but also has a lot to do with the reshoring of that manufacturing to build the infrastructure in this country to supply our own needs. It is a good long-term growth and there's 6 or so centers around the country that it's in, and we're positioned in what I would say, 3.5 or 4 of them going forward.  Industrial manufacturing, this is all the other stuff out of those high-tech sectors that we have broken out in commercial. This is things like tire manufacturing, paper manufacturing, food processing, and it's also the reshoring of supply chains in textiles and also things like HVAC, compressors, all those manufacturing motors coming back to the U.S. from overseas as we learned -- and it was happening even before the pandemic, but we learned in the pandemic, and it's an accelerator between that and the geopolitical uncertainty that we did not have the resilience in our supply chain that we should have and businesses learned that, right? They learned that you need to at least have this out of 2 factories or 2 suppliers and not just one.  Health care. Health care has been a great long-term market for EMCOR and health care for us extends beyond just hospitals to outpatient surgical centers, medical office buildings, and it's both a maintenance market for us, a retrofit market for us and a new construction market for us. We do the new systems, we do electrical mechanical retrofits, and we learned a lot during the pandemic that health care facilities needed to be more flexible and nimble to respond to a variety of things, right? Because in the pandemic, you need negative pressure rooms because of the oxygen requirements, you don't want to spread room to room. And in an other environment, you need positive pressure rooms and we have to be able to flip between the 2, and we have to have space that can be flexible to do a lot of different things.  The next part is really bolstered and we'll talk about that a little bit later by some recent legislation. But again, a transition that was happening anyway. We and a lot of other people believe it's not only an energy transition, but it's also an energy expansion. And it's not only a transportation transition, but it's a transportation mix is going to change.  We are positioned across the value chain for both. We can take part in all manners of the energy transition and also supplying and helping customers supply traditional energy sources. We also are positioned across the entire EV value chain from EV batteries, TEV vehicles and the plants. I mean, these things are all just getting built now to the charging stations and on account of charging stations, we built for the most part are industrial scale-charging stations, a lot of times attached to some of those big warehousing facilities were built for last-mile delivery.  Water and wastewater is a good market for us. We really do the electrical work almost everywhere in the country. That tends to be the smallest part of the work. Mechanically, we do this lights out in Florida, which is a big and growing market for 2 reasons: population inflow into Florida, but also consent decrees that require more investment to bring current facilities in some of the largest water districts up to snuff.  The last 3 are really cost-cutting services we provide across all sectors. We are one of the leading mechanical services providers. We do repair service, we do service agreements, we do control services, we do new control installations and then we do mechanical retrofits in our Mechanical Services business. Most of this leads to energy reduction, the less energy you lose, the less carbon you use, and we are definitely integrated into our customers' long-term energy-efficiency drive.  And an example of this is where a customer will come to us and have 200 or 300 facilities and say, we need to upgrade these. We need to take the energy out. A recent project we did, we took the equivalent of 4,400 cars off the road and save that customer a lot of money, and they got less than a 5-year payback on their money, which equates to about a 13% return, not bad. We do that work every day.  And also indoor air quality is now part of the solution. If you recall back in 2020, we were well positioned to help our customers have people peace of mind when they came back into the facilities. That now is an integrated solution when we do a building retrofit. We are positioned well with the big manufacturers there to do it. We also help them think about new products in that area. And it's also -- as Mark talked about, the CARES Act, that's a big part of what's going on in educational facilities today.  And in Fire Protection and Life Safety, we have great folks in the field executing this every day. On projects from as little as $10,000 to $100 million today and we do it well. Now all these things are being bolstered by a couple of interesting things right now, right? There's been some legislation. I'm not even going to talk about the Infrastructure Act, which we will participate in, transportation infrastructure, we pick our spots. It's not a big part of what we do. But anything that uses technical labor is good for us, right? Because we know we can get the technical labor and then anything that increases demand is good.  But I'm going to talk about 2 specific places, let's say. I'm not going to go into detail other than it took some of these trends, especially around the EV transition space and the energy transition space and have bolstered them, right? The IRA Act bolstered them and to get the tax credits, you're going to have to use labor like ours, and that labor is well trained. They get paid well. They're safe, and they've been through an approved furniture program.  On the CHIPS Act to get the credit, you're going to have to do Davis Bacon, we believe. But I think the apprentice stuff is going to be quite obvious because these are highly skilled people that come to work. EMCOR knows how to operate in that environment. And even where we are nonunion will supply that labor, we know how to make sure that the right apprentices or work hand in hand with our union companies. They have the right people on the right job at the right time.  So these acts maybe didn't create these markets, but they may accelerate some demand forward and also put a foundation on the investment that's happening today.  With that, I'm going to turn to Page 15 and close this and talk about capital allocation. Now a lot of great new news here. We're steady and programmatic about how we think about capital. I'd like to look at 2 years to talk about, we're comfortable in either world. We're comfortable in the world of 2019, where the preponderance of our capital that year went to acquisitions. And those acquisitions are bearing fruit as we support the previous page 14's investments. We would prefer to do that, quite frankly, because we're growing the business. But we also know that we'll have years like 2022, where the best thing we can do with our capital is take the majority of that capital that we're going to allocate that year and put it in return of cash to shareholders.  If you go to the 2016 to 2022 view of the world, at the end of the day, it will look something like this. Maybe the little green -- the dark green bar will go up a little bit if we look at the next 5 years. Maybe the one will come down a little bit. But the point being overall is we will be balanced capital allocators. It has served us and our shareholders well over a long period of time.  With that, I'm going to wrap this up on Pages 16 and 17. We expect to continue to have success in an uncertain market that we will mitigate by serving, growing and technically advanced end markets that I just talked about. And look, it's a challenging macroeconomic environment, and we sound like a broken record on that because it has been for quite some time. And we continue to perform through that challenging economic environment.  We are going to set guidance at $12 billion to $12.5 billion in revenue this year and $8.75 to $9.50 in earnings per diluted share. We talked about all this. We have the strong RPOs to execute. We have the right market position. We continue to see strong demand for all of our service, but fire-life safety, construction across all of our end markets.  Look, the supply chain issues are still bad and challenging. But we have figured out how to live in a world of long lead times and unreliable delivery schedules. For finished systems like switchgear generators and HVAC equipment. We also expect to see continued inflationary pressures for labor as well as materials and fuel. However, as we did in 2022, we will continue to adapt through better planning, pricing and estimating. Where we end up in this guidance range will depend on several factors, some in our control and some outside of our control and at EMCOR for a very long time, we've always tried to focus on the controllables.  So what do we need to do? We need to keep doing what we've been doing. We need to continue to increase our use of BIM, prefabrication and enhanced planning to drive improved efficiency, improved safety and increase the quality of our service delivery. We need to continue to enhance our pricing and estimating to mitigate the impact of inflation and supply chain challenges. We need to leverage our reputation as an employer of choice to staff our jobs with the right mix of skills and classifications to enhance our labor productivity and service and project delivery.  We need to continue to train and educate our employees at all levels of the organization to work smarter, lead better and lead with the values we have at EMCOR of Mission First, People Always and we need to continue to gain SG&A leverage much like we did in 2022. However, there's always things that could affect our performance that we don't control and we have to adjust to.  Material sourcing and lead times continue to challenge the market and our customers. That is a fact of life. I think I said a year ago that we thought that would be through mid-2023. I expect that trend to continue well into 2024. Higher interest rates and economic uncertainty may impact the demand for some of our products and services. Interest rates are up substantially. We all know that. I think disruption caused by uncertain energy markets and supply especially as the conflict in Ukraine continues and potentially intensifies. We expect to generate strong operating cash flow that at least approximates our net income and to continue to execute on our long-term capital allocation strategy that is balanced across supporting our organic growth, enhancing our core services in our markets through acquisitions while returning cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  We returned a record $688 million of cash to our shareholders in 2022 through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. We also announced, as Mark said, a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.15 a share to $0.18 a share, effective with our second quarter 2023 payment. And as always, this is the reality, right? And this is what underpins the whole company. Our success represents the hard work, diligence and strong leadership of our teammates at all levels.  And I want to thank each member of our EMCOR team for all you do for EMCOR every day. Stay safe and with that, we'll take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Noelle Dilts with Stifel.\nNoelle Dilts: Congrats on a good year. I was hoping you could kind of walk me through how you're thinking about the margin profile in each of the divisions that's embedded within your guidance for 2023?\nAnthony Guzzi: Yes, I'll take a shot at this, and then Mark will jump in. I think in general, in our guidance, I don't think on a consolidated level, we're planning on a big margin pop, right, Mark? It's -- we don't think that's going to happen.  And as you know, this isn't a pinpoint that margin by segment. It depends on mix. It depends on project timing. It depends on a lot of things, a contract structure. So we tend to think about this in buckets, right? We like to operate the mechanical business from the high 6s, 7s to the low 8s. Those are all up from 5 years ago, 100 or so basis points, we would have told you that. The electrical business should be the high 6s to the mid-8s.  The Building Services business, to a quarter or 2, they might be in the high 4s, and then we saw what they can do in the fourth quarter. But we tend to think about that as a 5% to 5.5% operating income margin. And remember, we have a lot of amortization within our Industrial Services but the bottom line there is people say, what are you going to get to? I think Mark and I would say, before we can talk about where we used to be, we got to get the 4% operating income margins on a sustained basis, and we haven't seen that for quite some time.  The U.K. when they're operating north of 5.5% or so percent, we're pretty satisfied and that depends a lot on mix too. Put all that together, you get an EMCOR mark somewhere between 5% and 5.5%.\nMark Pompa: Yes. And I think -- no, I'll just add to Tony's comments. I mean, I'm sure your team has done the math. I mean we're operating low within our 5- and 10-year averages. I guess at this point, it is the 10-year average even relevant. So if you look at the 5-year average, places where we'd like to see some improvement. As Tony commented a couple of times is clearly electrical. And as we've said a number of times on this call, a lot of 2022's performance was mix-related, putting aside some of the quarter 1 supply chain issues we experienced, particularly in that segment. And the  Industrial Services business, still on a 5-year basis is kind of there, but we're hopeful that we're going to revert back to the 10-year or something better than that. But once again, that's going to be dependent on what the customers are looking for from us. We don't create demand as good as we are, we're not that good. And ultimately, we have to be -- we have to have the people in place and the properties in place to facilitate providing services to those customers when they need it.  So we were at 5.4% in 2021. We were slightly below that on a consolidated basis in 2022. I think as Tony said, I think between that 5% and 5.5% is realistic, and it can move in any which direction for any particular segment, once again, depending on what the throughput is in the 12 months.  Once again, not to beat a dead horse, but our RPOs are the strongest they've ever been but that number relative to our full year annual guidance, revenue guidance. So there's still a lot more work that we have to book and build and obviously perform during the year. So depending on how that shakes out, it could certainly impact our consolidated margins by tens of basis points in any direction.\nNoelle Dilts: Okay. Great. And just a quick one on the M&A front. I mean I appreciated your comments on the call. Tony, I think last quarter when we spoke, you talked about wanting to make sure you're really comfortable that the companies are properly kind of booking work and are assessing the risks associated with the current macro environment. How are you thinking about just -- I guess, risk associated with M&A today? And do you feel like multiples are coming down to a more reasonable level to kind of reflect the current environment?\nAnthony Guzzi: Yes, I don't know about multiples overall. We don't really pay attention to them. We know we tend to evaluate each investment on its own merit. And where we have the most success is when we're working with an owner, they may have an intermediary working with them, but they really want to be part of our team and we try to get to a fair deal. We're not bargain buyers.  And I tend to look at things like this. We are very excited about the results of our acquisitions over the last 5 years. And that's a relevant time period. You do stuff way before that, market change, you do other stuff. In general, I think we're a good B, B+ student on acquisitions. The more you lean to it, our competitive process where we're buying from private , we've done that a few times. Okay, successfully, it tends to not be as high of a return, obviously. But where we can work together with management, develop a business case for the future, where we understand really in-depth their capabilities where we can build on those capabilities, where we can move them maybe a little bit out on the project size by a lot of peer learning.  We tend to get returns in the high teens. And if I look at how we've done in the last 5 years, we've been very judicious. I think about how we think about it, right? '19 was a great year for us acquisition-wise. We brought some good companies in. We've strengthened our Electrical portfolio mainly over the last couple of years. And that was just timing, right? People we've been talking to for quite a bit of time, and we haven't forced deals we ever have. Deals we walked away from that were larger because we couldn't get comfortable with their backlog. We couldn't get comfortable with their cash conversion.  And in our business, one of the things we look at is if we can't get comfortable with the cash conversion over a period of time, there's something not right in the reported results because our view of the world is, eventually, it all comes out in the cash. And so we start with that cash flow statement and move back through the due diligence. And that served us well over a long period of time.  We have a fairly healthy pipeline, deals close when they close. We look at 30 to get to 10 to get to 1, right? Our team screens. The team really only engages probably -- once we decide we're going to do something to get pretty far along, we have a pretty good idea that we're going to close it. We're also not afraid to walk away as new information becomes available in due diligence. And coupled with that, there are sometimes things we see in due diligence say go fix this, and we'll talk to you in a year. And when they talk to me in a year, they're a better company. They want to sell to us, and we get to a good place.  So ours is an iterative, interactive process where we try to build trust on both sides. We're not trying to make the lowest deal possible for us. We're trying to make the best deal for us over a long-term period. And I'd say over the last 5 years, that give us a good B+, A- because I don't think anybody is an A on acquisitions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson.\nBrent Thielman: Congrats on a great year. Tony, Mark, I appreciate the breakout of RPOs by commercial submarkets. It's really interesting stuff and see the telecom and high-tech sectors more than doubling year-on-year. Again, pretty interesting. That's obviously where you and others are talking about a lot of the growth in the commercial market, I guess, still to come. And Tony, I guess I've thought about data centers and semiconductor fabs is a little more regionally specific. My question is these areas of your business around the country that are really benefiting from these submarkets, do you have the manpower, the capacity to keep sort of supporting this pace of gains in these verticals? I mean what are the limitations here in your business?\nAnthony Guzzi: Well, that's actually the question we ask ourselves every time we think about one of these jobs. Can we do it on a sustained basis? Because if you think about -- and I agree, it's a geographic region within the U.S., you have to think about it. So you start with what does the core labor look like in that market? And in every case, there's not enough labor in that local market. And then you go to, okay, what is it going to take to attract labor and how much risk am I going to take to attract that labor.  So in an established market like Arizona, we have a pretty good idea of what it takes to bring labor in. We have a pretty good idea what that wage rate looks like and that shift structure. So it's not only wage rate, it's also what do the shift structure going to look like? Am I going to work 5, 10s, am I going to work 6, 10s with 3 days off? There's all kinds of different things you think about.  And then what is that local union loan go back to the comment on the different acts that are supporting this, what is that local union allow as far as classifications to be able to do the work? So in a more established market, where we've been doing like Arizona, we have a pretty good idea of what it's going to take. When you go to a new market or an asset market where we are in the market to some extent, but we may travel in and we're going to prefab a lot to traveling. We think about what peak manpower is going to be. We think about what resources we're going to have to put on the ground. But you also think about what your contracting mechanism needs to be at the start of the job.  So what we may be willing to do in a more established market on a contract side, we may not be willing to do it in a market where we're just establishing a present. So there for a while, we may operate more as a time and material until we can get a feel for what that labor force is going to look like. Next phases of the work we may take fixed price because we know and our customer ultimately knows what it took us to construct the labor force.  And so that's how we think about the manpower planning. So we start with the technical aspects of the process, can we do one of these? Then we start with what kind of risk is around that. Then we think about the supply chain challenges too and say, what is the owner providing and what do we have to provide on that job and intermixed on all that is the labor planning. And once we get a green light on the 3 and then contract structure, that's the fourth one, that's what -- you don't really know that until you've done all the other ones. Then we get a green light to say, yes, in fact, we'll do that project. But it's actually got to go through the thought process on all 4 of those gates.\nBrent Thielman: Yes, that's helpful, Tony. And I mean, as you look at the pipeline, of those sorts of opportunities, I mean is it large enough that you could conceivably still double your RPOs again next year? Is there any opportunity out there?\nAnthony Guzzi: Yes, I don't know about that. And the way we think about RPOs is different than a lot of other people. We're actually -- I'll let Mark get into that. But we're at the accounting definition. We have a contract in hand. It's a noncancelable portion of a service agreement. So other people might say, well, how we're going to be at this site for the next 3 years and look at all the work we're going to do. We don't do that, right? And it's approved change orders.  So I mean ours is a very stringent. I don't know what that growth will be. I mean this is a pretty heady level. It's okay. There's plenty of opportunity out there. Some of it will be contracted in a way you won't see it all in RPOs. It will show up later in revenues because it's more time and material or unit price-type work. And so that never fully shows up in RPOs. There's other work that will come out in pieces. And so it will come out depending on what we're doing.  Mark, do you want to jump in?\nMark Pompa: And Brent, the only thing I'll add to Tony's comments is back to the discussion of capital allocation and obviously allocating capital for growth. We clearly have a close eye on these opportunities, and when we're making those investments is where it's giving us the ability to take some of the labor out of the field back into the shop or into a more controlled environment where we're able to control the pace of progress a lot closer. So I wish in my long career here, those opportunities existed from day 1 that I walked in, but it was a much different market conditions then.\nAnthony Guzzi: And technology.\nMark Pompa: Yes. So our capabilities and our wherewithal is a lot stronger today than it certainly was then. And we have the balance sheet to make those investments. So I think from a competitive perspective, that certainly gives us an advantage. But at the end of the day, and one of the reasons why we've been successful for a long period of time is we're not going to enter into these arrangements with customers or potential customers if we do not believe that we do not have the ability to do 100% to fill those requirements. So the only governor I think on the opportunity in the short term is ultimately what our risk appetite is and ultimately where we want to play.\nAnthony Guzzi: And our risk appetite has less to do with can we do the job. But can we check all those 4 boxes? And capital allocation is a big deal for us. So a lot of the things we did in '18, '19, '17 acquisition-wise and even into '20 investment-wise, with shops and organic investment and all those things allowed us to be in a position to serve these customers. If we don't build fire fab shops in the right places with really a great team both at [indiscernible] Shambaugh & Son, we're not prepared to take care of these customers because you're not going to find enough labor to do that. So you have to be doing the prefabrication, like Mark said, but you also have to be able to get to work off the job because you want to make it safer and more repetitive and more -- the quality goes way up.  The second point is, when you think about the investment, it goes beyond even just physical infrastructure, we've put a lot of investment into our knowledge infrastructure. We put some resources around BIM to make it more predictable, reliable and it's not only a data infrastructure, but it's a people infrastructure to be able to share best practices. We also do a really good job of sharing best practices across the company through a series of peer groups where folks get together and share building techniques, right? And all those things are really important to allow us to serve our customer better.\nBrent Thielman: Really helpful. Just one more on the outlook for 2023. It sounds like you made some green shoots in Industrial Services business in terms of better opportunities in front of them. Can you just remind me where that business needs to be in order to kind of get back to that 4% kind of margin target that you've talked about?\nAnthony Guzzi: I don't know exactly. But I think if you could do more solo work, it was just different than what it was there last time, that would certainly help because it's work we do very well and go back to the means and method. We figured out some of the means and methods around the electrical work. I think that the more call-out work we do, the better. But look, the reality is we have customers operating at extraordinarily high levels of utilization, and they almost have to now to supply the refined product that the economy needs to run. So we are working different with those customers today and we'll adapt, and we're one of the go-to people to do it.  The mix plays a big role in that. The more we can get a shop work at the right pricing, the more we can get a cleaning work at the right pricing and the more work we can do in our Electrical business will help lift those margins overall.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson, Davis.\nAdam Thalhimer: Congrats on the strong fourth quarter and the outlook. BIM and prefab, can you talk a little bit about how much further you can push those? And should we look at that as a revenue opportunity for you guys, a margin opportunity or both?\nAnthony Guzzi: All of the above. It's a revenue opportunity in a sense of it allows us to capture more of the job in some cases and even sell some modules to people where we're not actually doing all the installation on a job. It's a margin opportunity since we make less mistakes and we have better yield. And we get more productivity out of the people and it allows us to mix the labor a little differently on the job.  And how far can we take it? I mean obviously, we're investing in the resource and to take it in a different direction. But it's a careful match between what's the BIM requirements. But then you also have to think about what your prefab plan is and then what your prefab infrastructure is and how much you're going to invest in that prefab infrastructure because you don't want to be too far ahead of what the need is, right? That's fixed costs.  And one thing we've learned is being good specialty contractors, you don't build a huge fixed cost base ever unless you know where it's going to support you over the next 2 or 3 years. It's why we don't own thousands of scissors lift, right? We're more than happy to be a great customer of rental companies like United Rentals.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. And then can you talk a little bit about your industrial group and if that could broaden out over time? Like I know you guys have been really focused on downstream energy for a long time, but is there anything that would prevent you from working on like a hydrogen hub or some of this other stuff?\nAnthony Guzzi: There's nothing at all that would prevent us. And we're not like wedded to anything. What we have is we've got great relationships with customers, and we can service their most advanced things. Pipe is pipe. We can do biofuels, we can do carbon capture. We can do -- one of the things we're most excited about is what can our Electrical group do in the renewable energy space, especially around solar? We can do all that. Just so happens, we didn't do as much of that as we wanted to last year because we can't get product, not that we can't get the product. Our ultimate end customer can't get the product. We have great industrial pipe fitters in that group, foremen, superintendents. We have good mill rights, and we have terrific field an electrician, they can do just about any.  One of the things I learned, and this is interesting. I went out to a solar job that they were doing. And our customer was struggling a little bit. They brought us in. We hadn't done -- we really hadn't done any one of these to scale up to that point. The ingenuity of the people that came out of the oil and gas business, they're used to working in austere conditions. They're used to working in demanding conditions. And they're used to being very flexible in their means and method. The productivity they were able to gain on that job versus people that specialize in it was quite remarkable. These are some of the most intuitive problem solvers across any of our businesses.  So when those opportunities present, we'll be there. We're working on the edges of that right now in the renewable fuels and biofuels area. We certainly have the solar thing installation down on the electric side. Now it's just getting the demand. But yes, we're not wedded to any one thing. We're going to go where the best margin opportunities are with that workforce.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. That's perfect. And then real quick, the whole Davis Bacon issue, does that give you an advantage or kind of a nonunion shop, just pay Davis Bacon?\nAnthony Guzzi: It doesn't hurt. This whole union, nonunion things in parts of the country where sometimes we know how to operate both. What I've learned is nobody wakes up in the morning other than maybe some of the big cities and say, I will never be a union electrician, and no one wakes up in the morning and said, I will never not be a nonunion electrician. Nonunion grows typically when the economy is not great, or when the building trades aren't great.  We recruited a lot of nonunion electricians and pipe fitters into the union ranks. We do it through the local union and as a result, they get into an apprentice program. And if you look at the IRA, it's geared towards apprenticeship programs. There's some good nonunion apprenticeship programs. It's a lot more rigorous for us to set up. We believe in those programs, both union and nonunion because it comes out with a safe productive work at the end.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tony Guzzi for any closing remarks.\nAnthony Guzzi: Yes. Thank you all very much for your interest in EMCOR. We're at the start of 2023. We have a pretty good outlook, and we'll be back to talk to you in April. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Anthony Guzzi",
            "content": "Good morning. Thanks, Kevin, and thank you all for your interest in EMCOR. My opening comments will cover Pages 4 through 6. I'm going to direct my comments towards our full year 2022 performance. And Mark will focus his remarks on both our fourth quarter and full year 2022 performance.  My only comments with respect to the fourth quarter of 2022 are that it was a record quarterly performance for revenues, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations and operating cash flow. We had an exceptional year in 2022 in a challenging environment. We earned revenues of $11.1 billion, with 11.8% revenue growth and 10.3% organic revenue growth. We executed well with a 5.1% operating income margin and generated exceptional operating cash flow of $498 million. We had strong SG&A leverage at 9.4% of sales, and all of that culminated in record earnings per diluted share of $1 -- of $8.10 per share.  During 2022, we faced some strong headwinds, including supply chain challenges, COVID disruptions and material and labor inflation. We adapted both our service and project pricing and planning to adjust for inflation and the inefficiencies caused by supply chain issues. As a result, after a tough first quarter, our financial performance improved as the year progressed, demonstrating our success in mitigating such challenges.  Our Mechanical Construction segment had an exceptional year with 9.5% revenue growth, all of which was organic and an operating income margin of 7.7%. This segment had excellent execution in the commercial market sector, especially in the area of high-tech manufacturing, with a focus on semiconductors and data centers. This segment additionally benefited from strength in the water and wastewater sectors and the health care market. We enhanced our capabilities in BIM, or Building Information Modeling and prefabrication, which allowed us to continue to deliver our services to our customers in a more productive, high-quality and safe manner.  We also continue to deliver exceptional fire-life safety projects, where we have earned our customers' confidence that we can deliver the most sophisticated technical solutions in the most demanding markets. Our portfolio of projects included semiconductor manufacturing plants, large distribution facilities, data centers as well as those for pharma and bio life science industries.  In summary, we had an excellent year in our Mechanical Construction segment and have a solid foundation for continued success.  Our Electrical Construction segment's performance strengthened through the year as expected and we finished the year more in line with our historical performance and expectations. This segment generated revenues of $2.43 billion and had very strong revenue growth of 19.9% for the year with 13.2% organic revenue growth.  Operating income margin was 6.1%, and we experienced continued excellent performance in the commercial sector, including the data center and semiconductor markets. This segment additionally benefited from greater demand within the health care market sector, and we continue to strengthen and build out our low-voltage service offering. Our Electrical Construction business continues to be a market leader and is positioned well going into the future.  Our U.S. Building Services segment had an exceptional year, driven by excellent performance across the majority of our service lines, including repair service, site-based services, building controls and HVAC projects. This segment earned revenues of $2.72 billion and delivered a 5.3% operating income margin. Revenue growth was 12.2% with organic revenue growth of 11.6%.  Our performance strengthened through the year as we had more precise pricing to offset material and fuel price increases and we became better at planning around difficult supply chain issues, driving demand for our services, our energy prices, which continue to be volatile and costly. This has created the need for enhanced energy efficiency and an uncertain supply chain, which has created the need to extend the life of our customers' mechanical equipment through repair services.  Customers are also demanding more efficient, proactive and integrated facilities management solutions that not only provide more self-performance of the most technical trades, but also provide the best vendor-managed solutions for cleaning, landscaping and other less technical trades. We have a very strong customer base with increased needs for our services, and we are delivering for our customers.  Our Industrial Services segment generated revenues of $1.12 billion which represents 13.4% revenue growth, all of which was organic. We continue to experience the resumption of normal demand for our services, which began in the second half of 2021. We have seen increased demand for turnaround in shop services related to the support of our customers' downstream operations. However, demand for our services supporting our upstream customers remains challenged.  Further, our renewable project activity remains muted as a result of the nonavailability of required materials to support large-scale solar installations. We expect to continue to see the segment recover more broadly to more normal operations and demand and expect demand and performance to continue to incrementally improve.  Despite foreign exchange headwinds, our U.K. Building Services segment had another strong year with operating income margins up 6.3%. Our team continues to deliver for some of the most sophisticated customers in the United Kingdom. We exited the year with $7.5 billion in RPOs versus $5.6 billion at the end of 2021, representing a 33% year-over-year increase. From a market perspective, we experienced the largest growth in RPOs within the commercial market sector. This includes both traditional commercial construction projects as well as our telecommunication/data center work and our high-tech manufacturing project such as EV and battery plants, semiconductor, biotech and life sciences.  These are important areas for EMCOR. And as a result of the continued growth, we will expand our RPO and revenue disclosures beginning in 2023 to provide greater insight into these sectors. And then beyond that commercial market sector, we see -- we saw RPO growth from the majority of the remaining markets in which we operate, including the health care, manufacturing, institutional and hospitality and gaming market sectors. We will discuss RPOs in more detail following Mark's commentary.  Our balance sheet remains liquid and strong and will continue to support our organic growth as well as our capital investment, acquisitions and return of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  During 2022, we completed 6 acquisitions, 5 tuck-ins to existing subsidiaries which bolster the capabilities of our Electrical, Mechanical and Building Services segments.  With that, I'll turn the discussion of our results over to Mark. Thanks, Mark, and I'm on Page 12, remaining performance obligations by segment and market sector. The fourth quarter of 2022 saw our ninth consecutive quarter of RPO growth. Momentum continues. We experienced healthy project demand throughout 2022 across all our segments and most of the market sectors that we participate in. If I look back a year, the company grew RPOs by $1 billion in 2021 and in 2022. As a result, our position and our market position has strengthened even more.  Total company RPOs at the end of 2022 were approximately $7.5 billion, up nearly $1.9 billion or 33%, over the December 2021 total of $5.6 billion. Additionally, fourth quarter project bookings were likewise strong, increasing $358 million in the final 3 months of the year. All but approximately $160 million of which, and that's associated with our August acquisition of Boston-based Gas and Electric.  As a side note, they have a terrific market position and dynamic leadership team that fits well with our EMCOR operating style and values. The rest of that growth was all organic. Again, for 2022, velocity in the business remained strong, with both revenue and total RPOs growing double digits from the previous year ago period.  While our continued growth of RPOs is largely due to the strength of demand for our services, a small portion of this increase can likely be attributed to external factors, such as material and labor inflation as well as supply chain delays, which elongate some of our projects.  Our 2 domestic construction segments experienced strong construction project growth year-over-year, with RPOs increasing just over $1.5 billion or 34% from December 2021. The Mechanical Construction segments saw RPOs increase by $737 million or 23%, while the Electrical Construction segment saw an increase of $789 million or a strong 64%. Much of this increase is continued demand for hyperscale data centers, industrial manufacturing facilities and semiconductor, life sciences and health care facilities.  U.S. Building Service RPO levels increased $279 million or 32% in 2022 and totals almost $1.15 billion in small to midsized project and service work. Like all of 2022, this quarter saw continued project awards in its Mechanical Services division and the award or renewal of several facilities maintenance contracts in our site-based services division.  EMCOR Industrial Services and our U.K. Building Services business while having less RPO-type projects supporting their business still saw their RPO totals for 2022 increase 12% and 36%, respectively. I should mention that over $42 million RPO increase in the U.K. business came despite unfavorable exchange rates against the dollar.  Moving to the right side of the page, we show RPOs broken down by market sector. Commercial RPOs grew 51% year-over-year, and I'm going to come back to this in greater detail on the next slide. Looking at the other market sectors, year-over-year growth, health care RPOs, 40%; institutional RPO, 21%; industrial manufacturing RPOs, up 22% and short-duration projects, which include work that our HVAC and controls retrofit work repair and service project work and low voltage work, up 15%. Partially offsetting the increase was a reduction in transportation and water and wastewater RPOs, which is booked in a much more episodic manner.  For greater transparency and on Page 13, we're going to break out commercial RPOs into the 3 large subsectors that we believe make up our commercial RPOs. Going forward into 2023, we will expand our RPO and revenue disclosures beginning to provide greater insight into these 3 sectors for our investors. So from bottom to top. The dark green section of the bar shows traditional commercial RPOs. It includes a lot of work in buildings and campuses, warehouses, mixed-use facilities, educational facilities and some retail. We have seen growth in traditional commercial RPOs over time, really from the result of energy savings projects and also strong fire protection and life safety project retrofits and new builds at various logistics facilities and other facilities across the country.  Going up the slide into the middle gray section, telecommunications, which is network and communications infrastructure projects, including data centers, data, fiber and cabling projects. Much of the growth here has been driven by hyperscale data centers, projects, but also the growth in our low-voltage business. The top right section of the bar is called high-tech projects. High-tech manufacturing and R&D facilities. Here, we capture projects in the semiconductor, biotech, life sciences, pharmaceutical, electric vehicle and EV battery and EV facilities -- and EV battery facilities.  As the slide shows, we have a strong base of traditional commercial projects. More specifically, the slide shows that our recent commercial growth has been concentrated in the other 2 sectors which represents 75% of our year-over-year commercial RPO growth. These are important subsectors for the company going forward, and we will expand our RPO and revenue disclosures beginning this year to provide greater insights into these important subsectors.  So look, in summary of the RPO section, we're busy. We're quoting work, our RPO level is high, demand for our service is high, and we continue to see an active pipeline of new projects. Given where we are, and we're going to make all the carve-outs in the last section of all the economic factors we don't control. We believe we have good visibility as we start out 2023.  We have good work in our RPOs. We have strong inquiries, and we have demand in the market sectors where we see momentum and where we execute well. And we have some of the best teammates and leaders on the ground and that allows us as a senior leadership team to be confident in our ability to complete the work we currently have and what we will win in 2023.  Now I'm going to turn to Slide 14, and it's a slide we've discussed a lot over the last 2 years. And it's a slide I love because it talks about trends in our business that have been good long-term trends in sectors that we performed very well. And what I'm going to do is talk about some crosscutting issues and also some specific sectors. We've been talking about data centers for a while, and we added semiconductor fabs and other high-tech manufacturing. We are very well positioned in data centers. In fact, I would argue we can do that work mechanically, electrically in fire protection as well or better than any contractor in the market, and we deliver great value for our customers.  We also deliver across a whole suite of our trades in the data center market from electrical, low-voltage, mechanical and fire protection. We do the same thing in semiconductor fabrication. We believe that's a market that while growing, and we'll talk about some of the things with recent legislation that's going to help it accelerate maybe a little bit but it was a good trend.  And in semiconductor fab in our estimation and in the market's estimation, our customers, this has less to do with new demand, but also has a lot to do with the reshoring of that manufacturing to build the infrastructure in this country to supply our own needs. It is a good long-term growth and there's 6 or so centers around the country that it's in, and we're positioned in what I would say, 3.5 or 4 of them going forward.  Industrial manufacturing, this is all the other stuff out of those high-tech sectors that we have broken out in commercial. This is things like tire manufacturing, paper manufacturing, food processing, and it's also the reshoring of supply chains in textiles and also things like HVAC, compressors, all those manufacturing motors coming back to the U.S. from overseas as we learned -- and it was happening even before the pandemic, but we learned in the pandemic, and it's an accelerator between that and the geopolitical uncertainty that we did not have the resilience in our supply chain that we should have and businesses learned that, right? They learned that you need to at least have this out of 2 factories or 2 suppliers and not just one.  Health care. Health care has been a great long-term market for EMCOR and health care for us extends beyond just hospitals to outpatient surgical centers, medical office buildings, and it's both a maintenance market for us, a retrofit market for us and a new construction market for us. We do the new systems, we do electrical mechanical retrofits, and we learned a lot during the pandemic that health care facilities needed to be more flexible and nimble to respond to a variety of things, right? Because in the pandemic, you need negative pressure rooms because of the oxygen requirements, you don't want to spread room to room. And in an other environment, you need positive pressure rooms and we have to be able to flip between the 2, and we have to have space that can be flexible to do a lot of different things.  The next part is really bolstered and we'll talk about that a little bit later by some recent legislation. But again, a transition that was happening anyway. We and a lot of other people believe it's not only an energy transition, but it's also an energy expansion. And it's not only a transportation transition, but it's a transportation mix is going to change.  We are positioned across the value chain for both. We can take part in all manners of the energy transition and also supplying and helping customers supply traditional energy sources. We also are positioned across the entire EV value chain from EV batteries, TEV vehicles and the plants. I mean, these things are all just getting built now to the charging stations and on account of charging stations, we built for the most part are industrial scale-charging stations, a lot of times attached to some of those big warehousing facilities were built for last-mile delivery.  Water and wastewater is a good market for us. We really do the electrical work almost everywhere in the country. That tends to be the smallest part of the work. Mechanically, we do this lights out in Florida, which is a big and growing market for 2 reasons: population inflow into Florida, but also consent decrees that require more investment to bring current facilities in some of the largest water districts up to snuff.  The last 3 are really cost-cutting services we provide across all sectors. We are one of the leading mechanical services providers. We do repair service, we do service agreements, we do control services, we do new control installations and then we do mechanical retrofits in our Mechanical Services business. Most of this leads to energy reduction, the less energy you lose, the less carbon you use, and we are definitely integrated into our customers' long-term energy-efficiency drive.  And an example of this is where a customer will come to us and have 200 or 300 facilities and say, we need to upgrade these. We need to take the energy out. A recent project we did, we took the equivalent of 4,400 cars off the road and save that customer a lot of money, and they got less than a 5-year payback on their money, which equates to about a 13% return, not bad. We do that work every day.  And also indoor air quality is now part of the solution. If you recall back in 2020, we were well positioned to help our customers have people peace of mind when they came back into the facilities. That now is an integrated solution when we do a building retrofit. We are positioned well with the big manufacturers there to do it. We also help them think about new products in that area. And it's also -- as Mark talked about, the CARES Act, that's a big part of what's going on in educational facilities today.  And in Fire Protection and Life Safety, we have great folks in the field executing this every day. On projects from as little as $10,000 to $100 million today and we do it well. Now all these things are being bolstered by a couple of interesting things right now, right? There's been some legislation. I'm not even going to talk about the Infrastructure Act, which we will participate in, transportation infrastructure, we pick our spots. It's not a big part of what we do. But anything that uses technical labor is good for us, right? Because we know we can get the technical labor and then anything that increases demand is good.  But I'm going to talk about 2 specific places, let's say. I'm not going to go into detail other than it took some of these trends, especially around the EV transition space and the energy transition space and have bolstered them, right? The IRA Act bolstered them and to get the tax credits, you're going to have to use labor like ours, and that labor is well trained. They get paid well. They're safe, and they've been through an approved furniture program.  On the CHIPS Act to get the credit, you're going to have to do Davis Bacon, we believe. But I think the apprentice stuff is going to be quite obvious because these are highly skilled people that come to work. EMCOR knows how to operate in that environment. And even where we are nonunion will supply that labor, we know how to make sure that the right apprentices or work hand in hand with our union companies. They have the right people on the right job at the right time.  So these acts maybe didn't create these markets, but they may accelerate some demand forward and also put a foundation on the investment that's happening today.  With that, I'm going to turn to Page 15 and close this and talk about capital allocation. Now a lot of great new news here. We're steady and programmatic about how we think about capital. I'd like to look at 2 years to talk about, we're comfortable in either world. We're comfortable in the world of 2019, where the preponderance of our capital that year went to acquisitions. And those acquisitions are bearing fruit as we support the previous page 14's investments. We would prefer to do that, quite frankly, because we're growing the business. But we also know that we'll have years like 2022, where the best thing we can do with our capital is take the majority of that capital that we're going to allocate that year and put it in return of cash to shareholders.  If you go to the 2016 to 2022 view of the world, at the end of the day, it will look something like this. Maybe the little green -- the dark green bar will go up a little bit if we look at the next 5 years. Maybe the one will come down a little bit. But the point being overall is we will be balanced capital allocators. It has served us and our shareholders well over a long period of time.  With that, I'm going to wrap this up on Pages 16 and 17. We expect to continue to have success in an uncertain market that we will mitigate by serving, growing and technically advanced end markets that I just talked about. And look, it's a challenging macroeconomic environment, and we sound like a broken record on that because it has been for quite some time. And we continue to perform through that challenging economic environment.  We are going to set guidance at $12 billion to $12.5 billion in revenue this year and $8.75 to $9.50 in earnings per diluted share. We talked about all this. We have the strong RPOs to execute. We have the right market position. We continue to see strong demand for all of our service, but fire-life safety, construction across all of our end markets.  Look, the supply chain issues are still bad and challenging. But we have figured out how to live in a world of long lead times and unreliable delivery schedules. For finished systems like switchgear generators and HVAC equipment. We also expect to see continued inflationary pressures for labor as well as materials and fuel. However, as we did in 2022, we will continue to adapt through better planning, pricing and estimating. Where we end up in this guidance range will depend on several factors, some in our control and some outside of our control and at EMCOR for a very long time, we've always tried to focus on the controllables.  So what do we need to do? We need to keep doing what we've been doing. We need to continue to increase our use of BIM, prefabrication and enhanced planning to drive improved efficiency, improved safety and increase the quality of our service delivery. We need to continue to enhance our pricing and estimating to mitigate the impact of inflation and supply chain challenges. We need to leverage our reputation as an employer of choice to staff our jobs with the right mix of skills and classifications to enhance our labor productivity and service and project delivery.  We need to continue to train and educate our employees at all levels of the organization to work smarter, lead better and lead with the values we have at EMCOR of Mission First, People Always and we need to continue to gain SG&A leverage much like we did in 2022. However, there's always things that could affect our performance that we don't control and we have to adjust to.  Material sourcing and lead times continue to challenge the market and our customers. That is a fact of life. I think I said a year ago that we thought that would be through mid-2023. I expect that trend to continue well into 2024. Higher interest rates and economic uncertainty may impact the demand for some of our products and services. Interest rates are up substantially. We all know that. I think disruption caused by uncertain energy markets and supply especially as the conflict in Ukraine continues and potentially intensifies. We expect to generate strong operating cash flow that at least approximates our net income and to continue to execute on our long-term capital allocation strategy that is balanced across supporting our organic growth, enhancing our core services in our markets through acquisitions while returning cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  We returned a record $688 million of cash to our shareholders in 2022 through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. We also announced, as Mark said, a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.15 a share to $0.18 a share, effective with our second quarter 2023 payment. And as always, this is the reality, right? And this is what underpins the whole company. Our success represents the hard work, diligence and strong leadership of our teammates at all levels.  And I want to thank each member of our EMCOR team for all you do for EMCOR every day. Stay safe and with that, we'll take questions. Yes, I'll take a shot at this, and then Mark will jump in. I think in general, in our guidance, I don't think on a consolidated level, we're planning on a big margin pop, right, Mark? It's -- we don't think that's going to happen.  And as you know, this isn't a pinpoint that margin by segment. It depends on mix. It depends on project timing. It depends on a lot of things, a contract structure. So we tend to think about this in buckets, right? We like to operate the mechanical business from the high 6s, 7s to the low 8s. Those are all up from 5 years ago, 100 or so basis points, we would have told you that. The electrical business should be the high 6s to the mid-8s.  The Building Services business, to a quarter or 2, they might be in the high 4s, and then we saw what they can do in the fourth quarter. But we tend to think about that as a 5% to 5.5% operating income margin. And remember, we have a lot of amortization within our Industrial Services but the bottom line there is people say, what are you going to get to? I think Mark and I would say, before we can talk about where we used to be, we got to get the 4% operating income margins on a sustained basis, and we haven't seen that for quite some time.  The U.K. when they're operating north of 5.5% or so percent, we're pretty satisfied and that depends a lot on mix too. Put all that together, you get an EMCOR mark somewhere between 5% and 5.5%. Yes, I don't know about multiples overall. We don't really pay attention to them. We know we tend to evaluate each investment on its own merit. And where we have the most success is when we're working with an owner, they may have an intermediary working with them, but they really want to be part of our team and we try to get to a fair deal. We're not bargain buyers.  And I tend to look at things like this. We are very excited about the results of our acquisitions over the last 5 years. And that's a relevant time period. You do stuff way before that, market change, you do other stuff. In general, I think we're a good B, B+ student on acquisitions. The more you lean to it, our competitive process where we're buying from private , we've done that a few times. Okay, successfully, it tends to not be as high of a return, obviously. But where we can work together with management, develop a business case for the future, where we understand really in-depth their capabilities where we can build on those capabilities, where we can move them maybe a little bit out on the project size by a lot of peer learning.  We tend to get returns in the high teens. And if I look at how we've done in the last 5 years, we've been very judicious. I think about how we think about it, right? '19 was a great year for us acquisition-wise. We brought some good companies in. We've strengthened our Electrical portfolio mainly over the last couple of years. And that was just timing, right? People we've been talking to for quite a bit of time, and we haven't forced deals we ever have. Deals we walked away from that were larger because we couldn't get comfortable with their backlog. We couldn't get comfortable with their cash conversion.  And in our business, one of the things we look at is if we can't get comfortable with the cash conversion over a period of time, there's something not right in the reported results because our view of the world is, eventually, it all comes out in the cash. And so we start with that cash flow statement and move back through the due diligence. And that served us well over a long period of time.  We have a fairly healthy pipeline, deals close when they close. We look at 30 to get to 10 to get to 1, right? Our team screens. The team really only engages probably -- once we decide we're going to do something to get pretty far along, we have a pretty good idea that we're going to close it. We're also not afraid to walk away as new information becomes available in due diligence. And coupled with that, there are sometimes things we see in due diligence say go fix this, and we'll talk to you in a year. And when they talk to me in a year, they're a better company. They want to sell to us, and we get to a good place.  So ours is an iterative, interactive process where we try to build trust on both sides. We're not trying to make the lowest deal possible for us. We're trying to make the best deal for us over a long-term period. And I'd say over the last 5 years, that give us a good B+, A- because I don't think anybody is an A on acquisitions. Well, that's actually the question we ask ourselves every time we think about one of these jobs. Can we do it on a sustained basis? Because if you think about -- and I agree, it's a geographic region within the U.S., you have to think about it. So you start with what does the core labor look like in that market? And in every case, there's not enough labor in that local market. And then you go to, okay, what is it going to take to attract labor and how much risk am I going to take to attract that labor.  So in an established market like Arizona, we have a pretty good idea of what it takes to bring labor in. We have a pretty good idea what that wage rate looks like and that shift structure. So it's not only wage rate, it's also what do the shift structure going to look like? Am I going to work 5, 10s, am I going to work 6, 10s with 3 days off? There's all kinds of different things you think about.  And then what is that local union loan go back to the comment on the different acts that are supporting this, what is that local union allow as far as classifications to be able to do the work? So in a more established market, where we've been doing like Arizona, we have a pretty good idea of what it's going to take. When you go to a new market or an asset market where we are in the market to some extent, but we may travel in and we're going to prefab a lot to traveling. We think about what peak manpower is going to be. We think about what resources we're going to have to put on the ground. But you also think about what your contracting mechanism needs to be at the start of the job.  So what we may be willing to do in a more established market on a contract side, we may not be willing to do it in a market where we're just establishing a present. So there for a while, we may operate more as a time and material until we can get a feel for what that labor force is going to look like. Next phases of the work we may take fixed price because we know and our customer ultimately knows what it took us to construct the labor force.  And so that's how we think about the manpower planning. So we start with the technical aspects of the process, can we do one of these? Then we start with what kind of risk is around that. Then we think about the supply chain challenges too and say, what is the owner providing and what do we have to provide on that job and intermixed on all that is the labor planning. And once we get a green light on the 3 and then contract structure, that's the fourth one, that's what -- you don't really know that until you've done all the other ones. Then we get a green light to say, yes, in fact, we'll do that project. But it's actually got to go through the thought process on all 4 of those gates. Yes, I don't know about that. And the way we think about RPOs is different than a lot of other people. We're actually -- I'll let Mark get into that. But we're at the accounting definition. We have a contract in hand. It's a noncancelable portion of a service agreement. So other people might say, well, how we're going to be at this site for the next 3 years and look at all the work we're going to do. We don't do that, right? And it's approved change orders.  So I mean ours is a very stringent. I don't know what that growth will be. I mean this is a pretty heady level. It's okay. There's plenty of opportunity out there. Some of it will be contracted in a way you won't see it all in RPOs. It will show up later in revenues because it's more time and material or unit price-type work. And so that never fully shows up in RPOs. There's other work that will come out in pieces. And so it will come out depending on what we're doing.  Mark, do you want to jump in? And technology. And our risk appetite has less to do with can we do the job. But can we check all those 4 boxes? And capital allocation is a big deal for us. So a lot of the things we did in '18, '19, '17 acquisition-wise and even into '20 investment-wise, with shops and organic investment and all those things allowed us to be in a position to serve these customers. If we don't build fire fab shops in the right places with really a great team both at [indiscernible] Shambaugh & Son, we're not prepared to take care of these customers because you're not going to find enough labor to do that. So you have to be doing the prefabrication, like Mark said, but you also have to be able to get to work off the job because you want to make it safer and more repetitive and more -- the quality goes way up.  The second point is, when you think about the investment, it goes beyond even just physical infrastructure, we've put a lot of investment into our knowledge infrastructure. We put some resources around BIM to make it more predictable, reliable and it's not only a data infrastructure, but it's a people infrastructure to be able to share best practices. We also do a really good job of sharing best practices across the company through a series of peer groups where folks get together and share building techniques, right? And all those things are really important to allow us to serve our customer better. I don't know exactly. But I think if you could do more solo work, it was just different than what it was there last time, that would certainly help because it's work we do very well and go back to the means and method. We figured out some of the means and methods around the electrical work. I think that the more call-out work we do, the better. But look, the reality is we have customers operating at extraordinarily high levels of utilization, and they almost have to now to supply the refined product that the economy needs to run. So we are working different with those customers today and we'll adapt, and we're one of the go-to people to do it.  The mix plays a big role in that. The more we can get a shop work at the right pricing, the more we can get a cleaning work at the right pricing and the more work we can do in our Electrical business will help lift those margins overall. All of the above. It's a revenue opportunity in a sense of it allows us to capture more of the job in some cases and even sell some modules to people where we're not actually doing all the installation on a job. It's a margin opportunity since we make less mistakes and we have better yield. And we get more productivity out of the people and it allows us to mix the labor a little differently on the job.  And how far can we take it? I mean obviously, we're investing in the resource and to take it in a different direction. But it's a careful match between what's the BIM requirements. But then you also have to think about what your prefab plan is and then what your prefab infrastructure is and how much you're going to invest in that prefab infrastructure because you don't want to be too far ahead of what the need is, right? That's fixed costs.  And one thing we've learned is being good specialty contractors, you don't build a huge fixed cost base ever unless you know where it's going to support you over the next 2 or 3 years. It's why we don't own thousands of scissors lift, right? We're more than happy to be a great customer of rental companies like United Rentals. There's nothing at all that would prevent us. And we're not like wedded to anything. What we have is we've got great relationships with customers, and we can service their most advanced things. Pipe is pipe. We can do biofuels, we can do carbon capture. We can do -- one of the things we're most excited about is what can our Electrical group do in the renewable energy space, especially around solar? We can do all that. Just so happens, we didn't do as much of that as we wanted to last year because we can't get product, not that we can't get the product. Our ultimate end customer can't get the product. We have great industrial pipe fitters in that group, foremen, superintendents. We have good mill rights, and we have terrific field an electrician, they can do just about any.  One of the things I learned, and this is interesting. I went out to a solar job that they were doing. And our customer was struggling a little bit. They brought us in. We hadn't done -- we really hadn't done any one of these to scale up to that point. The ingenuity of the people that came out of the oil and gas business, they're used to working in austere conditions. They're used to working in demanding conditions. And they're used to being very flexible in their means and method. The productivity they were able to gain on that job versus people that specialize in it was quite remarkable. These are some of the most intuitive problem solvers across any of our businesses.  So when those opportunities present, we'll be there. We're working on the edges of that right now in the renewable fuels and biofuels area. We certainly have the solar thing installation down on the electric side. Now it's just getting the demand. But yes, we're not wedded to any one thing. We're going to go where the best margin opportunities are with that workforce. It doesn't hurt. This whole union, nonunion things in parts of the country where sometimes we know how to operate both. What I've learned is nobody wakes up in the morning other than maybe some of the big cities and say, I will never be a union electrician, and no one wakes up in the morning and said, I will never not be a nonunion electrician. Nonunion grows typically when the economy is not great, or when the building trades aren't great.  We recruited a lot of nonunion electricians and pipe fitters into the union ranks. We do it through the local union and as a result, they get into an apprentice program. And if you look at the IRA, it's geared towards apprenticeship programs. There's some good nonunion apprenticeship programs. It's a lot more rigorous for us to set up. We believe in those programs, both union and nonunion because it comes out with a safe productive work at the end. Yes. Thank you all very much for your interest in EMCOR. We're at the start of 2023. We have a pretty good outlook, and we'll be back to talk to you in April. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Tony, and good morning to everyone participating on the call today. For those accessing this presentation via the webcast, we are now on Slide 7.  Over the next several slides, I will provide a detailed discussion of our fourth quarter 2022 results as well as a summary update of our full year performance, some of which Tony outlined during his opening commentary. As a reminder, all financial information discussed during this morning's call is included in our consolidated financial statements within both our earnings release announcement and Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier today.  So let's begin our Q4 commentary. Consolidated revenues of $2.95 billion are up $309.6 million or 11.7% from the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding $33.7 million of incremental revenues attributable to businesses acquired, pertaining to the time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in last year's quarter, revenues for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased approximately $276 million or 10.5% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.  Most of our reportable segments experienced strong revenue growth during the quarter, establishing a new all-time quarterly revenue record for EMCOR, specific segment performance is as follows: United States Electrical Construction revenues of $713.6 million increased to $166.2 million or 30.4% from quarter 4 2021. Excluding incremental acquisition revenues, this segment's revenues grew a strong 24.2% organically quarter-over-quarter. Increased project activity within the commercial market sector, inclusive of data center and technology projects as well as revenue growth within the health care and manufacturing market sectors were the primary drivers of the quarter-over-quarter revenue increase.  United States Mechanical Construction segment revenues of $1.14 billion, increased $77.4 million or 7.3% from quarter 4 2021. Revenue growth during the quarter was concentrated within both the commercial and institutional market sectors. With respect to the commercial market sector, we are continuing to benefit from increased project activity from our data center customers as well as growth within the high-tech submarket sector, driven by various semiconductor construction projects.  In terms of the institutional market sector, we experienced increased revenues as a result of various HVAC repair and replacement projects being performed across a number of geographies where we serve schools, universities and other educational customers who are continuing to deploy funding that was received under the CARES Act. These substantial revenue gains were muted by revenue declines in the manufacturing, health care and transportation market sectors quarter-over-quarter due to the completion or substantial completion of certain large projects which were active in the prior year period.  Both our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments established new all-time quarterly revenue records with their fourth quarter performance. Revenues of EMCOR's combined to domestic construction segments totaled $1.86 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of $243.6 million or 15.1%, with 13% of such revenue growth being organic.  Consistent with the last several quarters, we continue to be successful in winning new work to replace those projects, which are being completed as evidenced by the growth in the remaining performance obligations of these segments year-over-year. As is customary and as Tony previously commented, he will continue the RPO discussion at the conclusion of my financial commentary.  United States Building Services quarterly revenues of $704.2 million increased $83.9 million or 13.5%. Quarterly revenue growth was generated across all of the segment's operating divisions with the most significant growth being generated by the Mechanical Services and commercial site-based services divisions.  Within Mechanical Services, we benefited from strong demand for HVAC retrofit projects and building automation and control services with an emphasis on improving building efficiency, energy consumption and indoor air quality. We continue to assist our customers with their decarbonization efforts and the implementation of plans or programs to come back escalating operating costs. In addition, we continue to experience growth in service repair and maintenance volumes as persisting supply chain delays have resulted in the need to extend the useful lives of in-place HVAC equipment in instances when new equipment is not readily available.  With respect to the segment's commercial site-based services division, customer additions as well as scope or site expansion and increased project activity with existing customers were the drivers of the quarterly increase in revenues.  EMCOR's Industrial Services segment revenues of $276.2 million decreased to $7.4 million or 2.6% with refinery utilization in excess of 90% and continued pressure on refiners to maintain or increase downstream output, we are experiencing deferrals and delays of planned maintenance work as our energy clients seek to minimize facility downtime. This has additionally led to a reduction in pull-through repair project opportunities.  United Kingdom Building Services revenues of $113.3 million decreased $10.5 million. This revenue contraction was entirely due to unfavorable exchange rate movements for the GBP versus the USD which is masking revenue growth on a local currency basis as this segment experienced elevated project demand from its customers.  Please turn to Slide 8. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $277.6 million represent 9.4% of revenues and compares to $260 million or 9.8% of revenues in the year ago period. The current year's quarter includes approximately $5.1 million of incremental expenses from businesses acquired, inclusive of intangible asset amortization, resulting in an organic quarter-over-quarter increase in SG&A of $12.5 million. This quarter's organic growth in SG&A expenses is primarily related to personnel costs, due to both increased headcount to support our strong organic revenue growth as well as higher quarterly incentive compensation expense due to improved year-over-year performance at certain of our operating companies.  Despite the growth in SG&A dollars and consistent with our performance throughout the year, we have seen a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of revenues as we continue to successfully leverage our cost structure. As I mentioned over the last several quarters, we continue to remain disciplined with overhead investment and are seeking incremental efficiencies of scale as we continue to drive revenue growth.  Reported operating income for the quarter of $177.2 million compares to operating income of $143 million in 2021 fourth quarter and establishes a new all-time quarterly operating income record for EMCOR. Our consolidated operating margin of 6% represents a 60 basis point improvement from 2021's fourth quarter and continues our trend of sequential quarterly operating margin improvements in 2022 after a slow start in the first quarter.  Specific quarterly performance by segment is as follows: our U.S. Electrical Construction segment operating income of $58.1 million, increased $16.3 million from the comparable 2021 period and reported operating margin of 8.1% represents an improvement from the 7.6% in last year's quarter. These increases were a result of increased gross profit in gross profit margin within the commercial, health care and manufacturing market sectors, given a more favorable revenue mix. In addition, the increase in operating margin was partially attributable to a decrease in the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to revenues during the current year period.  This improved Electrical Construction segment performance was achieved despite certain discrete project write-downs totaling $10 million during the fourth quarter of 2022, which negatively impacted the segment's operating margin by 140 basis points. As referenced last quarter, we continue to evaluate our contractual rights on these projects and are pursuing recovery where permitted.  Fourth quarter operating income of United States Mechanical Construction Services segment of $105.7 million represents a $12 million increase from last year's quarter and operating margin of 9.3% represents a 50 basis point improvement from the strong 8.8% earned a year ago. From an operating income perspective, the period-over-period increase was largely a result of incremental gross profit contribution from those commercial market sector projects referenced during my revenue commentary.  With respect to operating margin, improved project performance, coupled with the reduction in SG&A as a percentage of revenues were the primary drivers of the quarter-over-quarter increase.  Operating income for U.S. Building Services was $37 million or 5.3% of revenues, which represents a $10.8 million or 41.2% increase period-over-period with a 110 basis point expansion in operating margin. The growth in both operating income and operating margin is due to improved fourth quarter performance within the segment's mechanical services, commercial site-based services and government services divisions. Notably, we experienced better project execution as well as a more favorable mix of work. This improved performance additionally reflects our continued focus on project pricing and disciplined cost management.  Our U.S. Industrial Services segment operating income of $1.5 million represents a $2.5 million reduction from the $4 million of operating income reported in 2021's fourth quarter. Such decline is due to a less favorable revenue mix as we experienced limited scope growth from projects being performed by this segment's field services operations during the 2022 fourth quarter. This also resulted in a reduction in pull-through equipment repairs for our shop services operations.  As I mentioned during my revenue commentary, minimization of equipment downtime has become a primary focus of this segment's customers, given the market conditions within the oil and gas industry.  U.K. Building Services operating income in 2022's fourth quarter of approximately $4.5 million is down moderately and operating margin of 3.9% is essentially flat when compared to that of the prior year quarter. From an operating income perspective, the reduction in U.S. dollars is entirely due to unfavorable exchange rate movements excluding the impact of foreign exchange, this segment's operating income increased as a result of the growth in project volumes referenced during my revenue commentary, as their customers continue with their capital spending programs.  We are now on Slide 9. Additional financial items of significance for the quarter not addressed in the previous slides are as follows. Quarter 4 gross profit of $454.8 million is higher than the comparable prior year quarter by $51.8 million or 12.8%. Gross margin of 15.4% has improved over last year's quarter and represents our highest reported gross margin for any quarterly period in 2022. This increase in gross margin when compared to 2021 fourth quarter as well as the sequential improvement throughout 2022 is due to the performance of our U.S. Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments as well as our U.S. Building Services segment as referenced during my segment operating income commentary.  Diluted earnings per common share in the fourth quarter of 2022 is $2.63 compared to $1.89 per diluted share for the prior year quarter. This fourth quarter EPS performance eclipses EMCOR's prior all-time quarterly record, which was established in the third quarter of 2022.  Please turn to Slide 10. With my fourth quarter commentary complete, I will now augment Tony's introductory remarks on EMCOR's annual performance. Consolidated revenues of $11.1 billion represent an increase of $1.17 billion or 11.8% when compared to 2021. Our full year results include $149.7 million of incremental revenues attributable to businesses acquired pertaining to the period of time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in 2021.  Excluding the impact of acquisitions, annual revenues increased 10.3% organically with all of our reportable segments generating double-digit or near double-digit organic revenue growth other than our United Kingdom Building Services segment due to negative foreign exchange rate movements during 2022, which have been referenced several times.  As a result of our performance over the last 3 quarters of this year, our full year operating income of $564.9 million surpassed the $530.8 million reported in 2021. Operating margin of 5.1% for 2022 compares to 5.4% in the prior year despite the 30 basis point reduction in operating margin, 2022's performance reflects excellent operational execution given the external market headwinds encountered during the year.  Full year diluted earnings per share is $8.10 and represents an increase of $1.04 or 14.7% over 2021's diluted EPS of $7.06. The combination of year-over-year net income growth with the reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding, given our share repurchase activity during 2022 has contributed to a new annual diluted EPS record for the company.  We are now on Slide 11. EMCOR's balance sheet remains strong and liquid, and we are well positioned to fund organic growth, return capital to shareholders and pursue strategic M&A investments. Fluctuations of note within our balance sheet when compared to December of 2021 are as follows: despite strong operating cash flow during the year of $498 million, our cash balance has declined from year-end 2021, as we're investing in financing outflows exceeded operating cash inflows. Notably, we utilized $660.6 million for the repurchase of our common stock, have spent a net $98.7 million on acquisitions and returned just over $27 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends. Resulting primarily from the decrease in cash, coupled with an increase in our net contract liability position, our working capital balances decreased by approximately $321 million. The impact of these items were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable, given the revenue growth we've experienced.  The $28.9 million increase in Goodwill since December of 2021 was entirely a result of the 6 acquisitions completed by us during calendar 2022. Net identifiable intangible assets have increased marginally period-over-period as the additional intangible assets recognized in connection with the aforementioned acquisitions were largely offset by amortization expense during the year.  Total debt, exclusive of operating lease liabilities has decreased by $14.5 million, largely as a result of the $13.9 million required principal payment made on our term loan in December of 2022. Our shareholders' equity balance has reduced by just under $279 million as our shareholder return activities, including common stock repurchases and dividend payments have exceeded our net income for the year. EMCOR's debt-to-capitalization ratio has increased to 11.1% from 10.4% at year-end 2021, given the reduction in our shareholders' equity just referenced.  As we stated before, our balance sheet in conjunction with the borrowing capacity available to us under our credit agreement will continue to enable us to invest in our business, return capital to shareholders and execute against our strategic objectives as we progress through 2023 in future periods. Our commitment to shareholder return is evidenced by both our share repurchase activity to date as well as today's announcement that our Board of Directors has approved an increase in our quarterly dividend of 20%.  With my portion of this morning's slide presentation completed, I would now like to return the call to Tony. Tony? Yes. And I think -- no, I'll just add to Tony's comments. I mean, I'm sure your team has done the math. I mean we're operating low within our 5- and 10-year averages. I guess at this point, it is the 10-year average even relevant. So if you look at the 5-year average, places where we'd like to see some improvement. As Tony commented a couple of times is clearly electrical. And as we've said a number of times on this call, a lot of 2022's performance was mix-related, putting aside some of the quarter 1 supply chain issues we experienced, particularly in that segment. And the  Industrial Services business, still on a 5-year basis is kind of there, but we're hopeful that we're going to revert back to the 10-year or something better than that. But once again, that's going to be dependent on what the customers are looking for from us. We don't create demand as good as we are, we're not that good. And ultimately, we have to be -- we have to have the people in place and the properties in place to facilitate providing services to those customers when they need it.  So we were at 5.4% in 2021. We were slightly below that on a consolidated basis in 2022. I think as Tony said, I think between that 5% and 5.5% is realistic, and it can move in any which direction for any particular segment, once again, depending on what the throughput is in the 12 months.  Once again, not to beat a dead horse, but our RPOs are the strongest they've ever been but that number relative to our full year annual guidance, revenue guidance. So there's still a lot more work that we have to book and build and obviously perform during the year. So depending on how that shakes out, it could certainly impact our consolidated margins by tens of basis points in any direction. And Brent, the only thing I'll add to Tony's comments is back to the discussion of capital allocation and obviously allocating capital for growth. We clearly have a close eye on these opportunities, and when we're making those investments is where it's giving us the ability to take some of the labor out of the field back into the shop or into a more controlled environment where we're able to control the pace of progress a lot closer. So I wish in my long career here, those opportunities existed from day 1 that I walked in, but it was a much different market conditions then. Yes. So our capabilities and our wherewithal is a lot stronger today than it certainly was then. And we have the balance sheet to make those investments. So I think from a competitive perspective, that certainly gives us an advantage. But at the end of the day, and one of the reasons why we've been successful for a long period of time is we're not going to enter into these arrangements with customers or potential customers if we do not believe that we do not have the ability to do 100% to fill those requirements. So the only governor I think on the opportunity in the short term is ultimately what our risk appetite is and ultimately where we want to play."

I will discuss our third quarter results in my opening comments and Mark will cover the third quarter and year-to-date results in greater detail. My opening commentary will focus on Pages 4 through 6. We delivered another strong quarter at EMCOR. Revenues grew to $2.83 billion with 12.1% overall revenue growth and 10.8% organic revenue growth, continuing the strong organic revenue growth we have earned over the last three years. I believe that this achievement, a consistent, strong organic revenue growth and the underlying profit growth is a testament to our positioning in certain key markets and a result of our long-term acquisition programs, capital spending, leader development programs, and customer and sector focus. Further, our gross margin gap versus prior year performance had closed to a smallest gap this year. This shows that we are narrowing the impact of the supply chain disruptions and inflation as we price, plan and execute our project and service work. We grew operating income to $150.1 million with 5.3% operating income margins. We had strong SG&A leverage with SG&A margin at 9.3% of revenues. Our operating cash flow was exceptional at $257 million in the quarter. Our diluted earnings per share was $2.16 per share compared to a $1.85 per share for the third quarter of 2021. This is excellent overall performance, especially against the challenges of continued supply chain disruptions and inflation. These issues are still present and it does present operating challenges that we have to work through. I am always amazed at the resourcefulness, flexibility and depth operating skills of our field leadership team as they plan and execute around an ever-changing and volatile environment and achieve excellent execution for our customers. I will now cover some highlights by segment. We continue to have very strong revenue growth in our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments. Our Mechanical Construction segment revenues grew at 11.2% in the quarter and most of that growth in this segment was organic. Electrical Construction segment revenues grew at 19.3% with 13.1% organic revenue growth. Operating income margin of 5.6% in the Electrical Construction segment was challenged by product mix, timing and some legacy transportation project issues. We continue to see very strong performance from our data center and high-tech manufacturing projects and are experiencing sizable growth in our commercial RPOs driven by these project awards. We expect Electrical operating income margins to rebound sequentially as we finish the year and move into 2023 as our mix improves as projects delayed by extended lead times for major equipment commenced into the execution phase. Operating income margin in our Mechanical Construction segment was 8.1%, driven by exceptional execution in the commercial market sector on several semi-conductor, pharma and life science projects. Our Mechanical Construction segment also performed well with respect to our fire protection offerings, what cuts across all geographies and sectors of performance. Supply chain and inflation challenges continue and will remain part of our project planning and execution through the balance of 2022 and well into 2023. Our U.S. Building Services segment had an excellent quarter with an operating income margin of 6.4% and 38.7% operating income growth, driven in part by revenues of $710.7 million which represented 13.8% revenue growth quarter-over-quarter and that was all mostly organic revenue growth. We had strong repair service, HVAC project, and energy efficiency project execution. Driving this growth is the underlying demand for our offerings. We leave this quarter with record RPOs as we continue to benefit from our customers' demand for energy efficiency upgrades in indoor air quality improvement. It was a great quarter for Building Services. Our Industrial Services segment faced a headwind of delayed turnaround projects as our customers pushed some work into the fourth quarter. Third quarter is typically a seasonally weak quarter in the Industrial Services segment. And we believe we will continue to see improved performance in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of 2023. We are also hampered in this quarter by delayed startup and awards on several solar opportunities that we are well-positioned to execute as supply chain disruptions ease. Our United Kingdom Building Services segment continues to excel with 7.1% operating income margins, favorable project mix, and excellent customer delivery. Our team continues to perform well against the backdrop of very challenging economic environment and foreign exchange headwinds. We exit the quarter with a strong balance sheet, RPOs Remaining Performance Obligations at a record level of $7.1 billion versus $5.4 billion a year ago and $5.6 billion at the end of 2021. With that I'll turn the call over to Mark and he'll go over the quarter in detail.\nMark Pompa: Thank you, Tony, and good morning to everyone on the call today. For those accessing this presentation via the webcast, we are now on Slide 7. Over the next several slides, I will augment Tony's opening commentary on EMCOR's third quarter performance as well as provide a brief update on our year-to-date results through September 30. All financial information referenced this morning is derived from our consolidated financial statements included in both of our earnings release announcement and Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier today. So let's revisit and expand a review of EMCOR's third quarter performance. Consolidated revenues of $2.83 billion are up $304.7 million or 12.1% over quarter three 2021 and represent a new all-time quarterly revenue record for EMCOR. Each of our reportable segment experienced quarter-over-quarter revenue growth other than our United Kingdom Building Services segment which was negatively impacted by unfavorable exchange rate movements during the quarter. Excluding $32.8 million of revenues attributable to businesses acquired pertaining to the time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in last year's quarter, revenues for the third quarter of 2022 increased approximately $272 million or 10.8% when compared to the third quarter of 2021. The specifics of each reportable segment are as follows: United States Electrical Construction segment revenues of $633.4 million increased a $102.4 million or 19.3% from quarter three 2021. Excluding incremental acquisition revenue this segments revenue grew a strong 13.1% organically quarter-over-quarter. Increased project activity within the commercial markets sector, inclusive of the telecommunications and technology submarket sectors as well as revenue growth from projects supporting both sustainable energy solutions and other traditional energy sources within the manufacturing market sector were the main drivers of the period-over-period increase. In addition, this segment continues to provide electrical solutions to our healthcare clients where they remain strength and demand for large capital projects. United States Mechanical Construction revenues of $1.12 billion increased a $113 million or 11.2% from quarter three 2021. Revenue growth during the quarter was driven by increases within the commercial, institutional, and water and wastewater market sectors. With respect to commercial sector revenue growth we are benefiting from increased project activity for customers within the semiconductor industry as well as customers within the biotech, life sciences and pharmaceutical industries. These projects include both traditional and mechanical construction as well as fire protection services. In addition, within the commercial market sector we continue to see increase in demand for our fire protection services notably from our e-commerce customers as they expand their warehouse and distribution facilities. From an institutional market sector perspective, revenue growth was geographically broad-based and included increased revenues from a number of schools, universities, and other educational customers, including those which have received funding for HVAC repair and replacement under the CARES Act. On the other hand, our water and wastewater revenues remain concentrated within the Southern United States where we are supporting the increasing demand for potable drinking water and the treatment of wastewater given the shift in population in that region. Third quarter revenues from EMCOR's combined United States Construction business of $1.75 billion increased $215.4 million or 14% with 11.9% of such growth being organic. This combined revenue performance as well as the revenue performance of each of our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments represent new all-time quarterly revenue records. Consistent with last quarter, the achievement of these records have been accomplished while also increasing remaining performance obligations, which also represent all-time highs for each of our construction segments. Tony has already commented on our RPO development during the quarter and he will be providing more detailed commentary at the conclusion of this financial section. United States Building Services quarterly revenues of $710.7 million increased $86.1 million or 13.8%. Revenue growth was generated within this segments Mechanical Services and commercial site-based services divisions. Within Mechanical Services, we continue to benefit from strong demand for HVAC retrofit projects in building automation and control services with an emphasis on improving building efficiency, energy consumption, and indoor air quality. In addition, we are experiencing growth in service repair and maintenance volumes as supply chain delays have resulted in the need to extend the useful lives of existing HVAC equipment in instances when replacement equipment is not readily available. With respect to the segments commercial site-based services division, new customer additions, as well as scope or site expansion and increased project activity with existing customers were the drivers of the quarterly increase in revenues. EMCOR's Industrial Services segment revenues of $247.2 million, increased $15 million or 6.5%. Although, the quarterly growth is not as significant as that of our last two quarters, we were encouraged to see solid mid-single-digit revenue growth as quarter three represents this segments seasonally slowest period as Tony previously mentioned. This revenue growth was despite the headwinds created by refinery utilization well in excess of 90% during the majority of the quarter, which can often limit the opportunities to provide field services as our customers are reluctant to take down the refineries for any extended maintenance. United Kingdom Building Services revenues of $117.7 million decreased $11.8 million. As previously mentioned, this revenue contraction was entirely due to unfavorable exchange rate movements for the British pound versus the United States dollar, which is masking revenue growth on a local currency basis. This segment continues to see strong project demand from the commercial market sector customers inclusive of the telecommunications submarket sector. Please turn to Slide 8. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $263.1 million represent 9.3% of revenues and compares to $243.9 million or 9.7% of revenues in the year ago period. The current year's quarter includes approximately $3.7 million in incremental expenses from businesses acquired inclusive of intangible asset amortization, resulting in an organic quarter-over-quarter increase in SG&A of $15.5 million. This quarter's organic growth and SG&A expenses is primarily related to increased personnel costs due to both increased headcount to support our organic revenue growth as well as higher quarterly incentive compensation expense due to improved year-over-year performance at certain of our operations. Additionally, we continue to experience growth in travel and entertainment expenses as our employee business travel continues to resume normalcy. Despite the growth in SG&A dollars, we have seen a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of revenues as we successfully leverage our cost structure. As I mentioned last quarter, we continue to maintain discipline with overhead investment and will seek incremental efficiencies and economies of scale as we drive future revenue growth. Reported operating income for the quarter of $150.1 million or 5.3% of revenues compares to operating income of $137.4 million or 5.4% of revenues in 2021's third quarter. Our $150.1 million of quarterly operating income eclipses EMCOR's all-time quarterly OI record set in 2021's fourth quarter. Our operating margin of 5.3% represents a sequential improvement from that of quarter two, which was also sequentially higher than quarter one. Despite inflationary pressures and supply chain headwinds EMCOR continues to execute at a high-level, producing strong operating results and margin conversion on a revenue base, which continues to grow. Specific quarterly performance by segment is as follows: our U.S. Electrical Construction segment operating income of $35.6 million, decreased $8.7 million from the comparable 2021 period. Reported operating margin of 5.6% represents a reduction from the 8.3% in last year's quarter, the decrease in both operating income and operating margin is due to a less favorable project mix within the commercial, institutional and transportation market sectors, coupled with certain discrete project write-downs totaling $10.5 million during the quarter, which negatively impacted the segment's operating margin by 170 basis points. These losses were due in part to supply chain disruptions as well as project completion delays and time extensions beyond our control. The majority of these projects were bid a number of years ago under different economic conditions where the extent of these supply chain disruptions as well as current inflationary pressures and escalating material prices could not have been contemplated. We continue to evaluate our contractual rights and are pursuing recovery were permitted. Aided by the increase in segment revenues, third quarter operating income of our U.S. Mechanical Construction segment of $91 million represents a $10.2 million increase from last year's quarter, while quarterly operating margin of 8.1% is modestly improved from 8% in 2021's third quarter. This improvement on operating margin is despite having a larger number of active projects within the manufacturing and water and wastewater sectors where we are either acting as a construction manager or general contractor. In these cases, our percentage of self-performed labor is less than a typical EMCOR construction project, thereby resulting in a lower gross margin profile. Operating income for U.S. Building Services is $45.6 million or 6.4% of revenues, which represents a substantial $12.7 million or $38.7 million -- sorry, 38.7% increase period-over-period with a 110 basis point in expansion and operating margin. Driven by the performance of our Mechanical Services division, this segment is benefiting from both favorable project execution as well as the impact of certain pricing adjustments aimed at better aligning our billing rates with the increased operating costs we have experienced. Our U.S. Industrial Services segment operating loss of $1.4 million represents a $1.6 million improvement from the $3 million loss reported in 2021's third quarter. As I referenced earlier, quarter three is historically our Industrial segments seasonally weakest quarter. Additionally, the delay or deferral into future periods of certain customer turnaround projects, which were anticipated to commence in September of this year, resulted in a shortfall when compared to internal expectations for the quarter. UK Building Services operating income of $8.4 million or 7.1% of revenues represents an increase of $1.8 million and a 200 basis point improvement in operating margin quarter-over-quarter. This improved operating income performance is despite the foreign exchange headwinds mentioned during my revenue commentary, which reduced the segments reported operating income by $1.4 million in the quarter. This segment continues to benefit from a more favorable mix of project work when compared to the prior year. We are now on Slide 9. Additional financial items of significance for the quarter are not addressed in the previous slides or as follows: Quarter three gross profit of $413.2 million represents an all-time gross profit record for the company and is higher than the comparable 2021 quarter by $31.9 million or 8.4%. However, gross margin of 14.6% is lower than last year's third quarter primarily due to the impact the project write-downs within our Electrical Construction segment, which negatively impacted our consolidated gross profit margin by 40 basis points during the quarter. Although, the quarter-over-quarter gross margin compare is unfavorable, 14.6% of gross margin is sequentially higher than our first two quarters of 2022 and the 50 basis point year-over-year reduction represents the smallest quarterly variance to-date in the current year. Diluted earnings per common share in the third quarter of 2022 was $2.16 as compared to $1.85 per share for the prior year period. This third quarter EPS performance represents a new quarterly earnings per share record for EMCOR due to the combination of net income growth and a reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding given our continued share repurchase activity during the year. Please turn to Slide 10. With my quarter commentary out of the way, let's touch on some highlights with respect to EMCOR's results for the first nine months of 2022. Revenues of $8.13 billion represent an increase of $862.9 million or 11.9% of which 10.3% of such revenue growth was generated from organic activities. As a result of our exceptional performance over the last two quarters, our year-to-date operating income of $387.7 million approximate to that of 2021, which is quite impressive given the headwinds previously discussed. Operating margin for the year-to-date period is 4.8% and we continue to reduce the year-over-year gap, which is now only 50 basis points. On a combined basis, our U.S. Construction operations have experienced sequential quarterly improvement on operating margin throughout the year, and all of our other segments are reporting nine-month operating margins, which are either equal to or greater than that of the corresponding prior year period. Year-to-date diluted earnings per share was $5.50 and represents an increase of 6.4% from the $5.17 of EPS reported in 2021's nine-month to-date period. Although not shown on this slide, my last comment on our year-to-date results is with respect to our strong operating cash flow. In the nine-month period, we have generated $238.4 million of operating cash flow, which represents a substantial improvement over last year. Although, we had a slow start during the first six months of 2022, we generated $257.2 million of operating cash during the third quarter. Despite our strong organic revenue growth to-date in 2022, and the resulting requirement for working capital investment, our subsidiary management and project teams have done an excellent job of maintaining discipline in their project and service contract administration resulting in great cash conversion. We are now on Slide 11. EMCOR's balance sheet remains strong and we continue to be in a position to invest in our business, return capital to shareholders, and pursue strategic M&A transactions. Despite the significant operating cash flow I just mentioned, our cash on hand has declined from year-end 2021 as a result of cash used in investing and financing activities during the first nine months of 2022. Notably, we utilized $656.6 million for the repurchase of our common stock, have spent $91.1 million on acquisitions, and returned $20 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends. This activity was funded by our cash on hand as well as $170 million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Resulting primarily from a decrease in cash, coupled with an increase in our net contract liability position, our working capital balance has decreased by nearly $289 million from year-end 2021. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable, given the revenue growth we continue to experience. In terms of other fluctuations within our balance sheet, the $26.5 million increase in goodwill since December of last year was entirely a result of the acquisitions completed by us thus far in 2022. Net identifiable intangible assets have increased by approximately $16.6 million as the additional intangible assets recognized in connection with the aforementioned acquisitions were partially offset by amortization expense during the period. Total debt exclusive of operating lease liabilities has increased by nearly $170 million since December, given the borrowings under our revolving credit facility that I previously mentioned. As a result of this incremental debt coupled with the reduction in our shareholders' equity due to our capital allocation activities, EMCOR's debt to capitalization ratio has increased from 10.4% at year-end 2021 to 18.9% at September 30, 2022. We remain committed to our long-term capital allocation strategy and with our consistent free cash flow generation, along with our liquidity, inclusive of revolving credit capacity, we continue to remain flexibility in our ability to execute against our strategic objectives. With my portion of this morning slide presentation completed, I will now give the call back to Tony. Tony?\nTony Guzzi: Thanks, Mark. Well done. And I'm on Page 12, Remaining Performance Obligations or RPOs. And we have diverse RPOs of $7.10 billion an all-time record. We continue to be successful on winning new work and winning matters, as the company we had another strong project bookings quarter. We've experienced healthy demand throughout 2022 across our segments and many market sectors. And while we have always described our business as not predicated on month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter, it ebbs and flows with projects and projects award. It is noticeable that our RPOs total has increased in eight consecutive quarters fueled overwhelmingly by organic RPO growth, and that's with strong underlying organic revenue growth. Total company RPOs at the end of the third quarter were $7.1 billion or up $1.7 billion or 32% over the September 2021 total of $5.4 billion. From the end of last year, RPOs are up $1.5 billion or 27%. Additionally, we booked $641 million of work in the three months since June 30. The complexion of our RPO portfolio has changed a bit over the last 12 months or so. In general, length is going up of projects as projects scope increases and that's because of supply chain issues, which remain elevated and also the technical complexity and labor complexity of the what kinds of projects we're winning at the higher end of the project the larger projects. When you have those complex supply issues, coupled with the ability to track and retain and deploy the right mix of skilled craft labor, and the ever-present technical demand of projects, many of our customers are looking for the contractor or us that could be a preferred choice to complete some of these technically sophisticated projects where they may be hyperscale data centers, food processing plants, semiconductor fabs, hospitals, pharma plants, biolife plants, healthcare facilities, or broad-based energy efficiency upgrades. Together, our two domestic construction segments experienced strong project growth year-over-year with RPOs increasing just under $1.5 billion or 34%. U.S. Building Services RPOs increased $276 million from the year ago period, or 33% that's one point -- and is now at about $1.1 billion and small to mid-size project work and also service work. This call -- this quarter, we saw the increase in our Mechanical Service division and the reorder or renewal of several facilities maintenance contract in its site-based services division. As I mentioned last quarter, these extended lead times for HVAC equipment combined with a push for energy efficiency and improved building wellness is resulting in our customers asking us to retrofit and when we can't retrofit on time, as Mark said, we're repairing their equipment. The additionally -- we think about the lack of equipment ability, it is driving our repair service work because equipment still needs to run. In my opinion, lead time for applied HVAC equipment will continue to be extended well into 2023. Moving to the right side of the page where we have our RPOs broken down by market sector. As I mentioned earlier, quarter three was a strong booking quarter, supported by RPO increases in all sectors against water and wastewater and we have good underlying trend in the markets where we compete water and wastewater, they tend to be more episodic awards. Market sectors were led by project awards in our broadly defined commercial sector. That includes numerous data center projects, semiconductor projects and projects, customers within the biotech life science and pharma industries. It's not yesterday's or 10 years ago commercial market sector. Finishing our market sector year-over-year growth healthcare up 33%, institutional up 24%, and short duration projects for most of the retrofit work and if energy efficiency work is up 34%. Partially offsetting that was minor decreases in water and wastewater industrial manufacturing and a decrease in transportation RPOs. What I said last quarter still rings true today. I continue to like the balance and breadth from both the businesses segment and market perspective and a geographic perspective of our RPO portfolio as we closeout 2022 and we move into 2023. I'm going to talk about the next slide Page 13. And I've talked about this because it is some underlying trends that are driving their business and our business and they look like they have legs well into the future. And look some of these awards come in bulky and episodic for the bigger work like data centers and semiconductor fabs and some of it is more quick hitting like the indoor air quality mechanical services work. But you go to data centers and semiconductor fabs, we see good demand and we see that continuing well into 2023. And we're positioned in all the right geographic markets with the right people. Are we in every one of them? No, but we're in enough of them to make a difference. There's strong demand for electrical systems. When you think about data centers, bigger electrical systems, smaller mechanical systems today, still big content on both parts. Fire protection goes across everything. If you think about semiconductor fabs for EMCOR, it flips, stronger mechanical demand, lesser electrical demand, again, fire protection demand across it. Fire protection, we can cover the entire geography of the U.S. for these opportunities. Industrial manufacturing and some of this shows up in our commercial because that's where our pharma life sciences and biotech is, we see strong opportunities and really what's driving that. One is new products, new facilities, strengthening supply chains and the reassuring of manufacturing and also still relocation from higher cost states to lower cost states. Healthcare, this for us is outpatient healthcare facilities, hospitals and large physician medical office buildings. These are both upgrade opportunities as well as new construction opportunities as people seek more flexibility in their healthcare systems and pandemic taught people a lot. And also just the aging of America and the aging of these facilities are driving this demand. We put a new one in here and energy transition and transportation. And if you think about it, I heard it best from one of the big utility CEOs today. He said all of the above strategy and EMCOR can participate in an all of the above strategy. It's not an either/or energy demand is increasing. If you think about what's happening with healthcare facilities, data centers, semiconductor fabs, and industrial manufacturing resource, we're not going to be using less energy in America. And so we need all sources of energy to excel and you're coal will phase out. And so you're going to need natural gas to supplement the renewables. Nuclear, they're opening I guess they're fueling the first nuclear plant in Georgia. Not a big market for us, but on the periphery we will support nuclear plants. The one in Georgia is getting built, be the first one in a generation. Energy transition, we do participate in the solar and wind markets. In some very specific transmission and distribution opportunities, but also in the emplacement of the solar fields, we should have been doing more of that work today. We do that in both the Electrical segment and we do it in the Industrial Services segment because of the positioning of the assets and the capability. We've learned if some of those oil and gas guys are great solar builders. They're very good at it. And then you got the whole value chain of automotive. From all the way back at the mines, the lithium mines and the transportation, all the way through manufacturing and battery, all the way through to EVs and the new plants that are being built to the distribution centers that are now putting industrial scale. So we'll look, is EMCOR going to be the person that's going to build the EVs charging stations at rest stops, probably not. We'll do it episodically or we'll do it within a local market. We are the people that are doing it at the major distribution hubs. Those are high intensity electrical projects that are almost substation grade installations. And then that'll move all the way down through how you continue to do battery storage, which is a best embryonic at this stage. So and then you've got all underlying demand charges. And what's going to have to happen with the gas system to support the renewable grid. I'm actually quite bullish on how we participate on that over a 20-year time horizon. It is not a three-year project. This is a 20 to 30-year transition. And beyond the transition, we're going to need more energy. And that's not to say that we're not going to continue to support the downstream refining petrochemical and upstream market in oil and gas. Water and wastewater, Mark touched on it. We're mainly concentrated in the Southeast and even more so in Florida. There is a couple of things going on there. You had consent decree work that was going on with our some of our customers. Now you have strong underlying demand if more people moved into those states. And the demand for fresh water, wastewater treatment, is continuing to increase. Mechanical Services, there is none better than EMCOR mechanical service work. There is nobody better at putting energy efficiency project in. And we have the scale, we have the people, we have the technical know-how, and we have the OEM relationships and controls product offerings to make it happen in a big way not only from an efficiency upgrade standpoint, but from an indoor air quality. And finally, we're the best fire protection contractor in the United States bar none. We're good. We can do large projects. We can do small projects. We can do service. We have the fab capability to deliver that at a cost that's competitive for our customers on the most technically sophisticated projects in the country. And all that other stuff I talked about is being built up. Now, let's go to closing on Pages 14 to 15 and what most of you care about is we took up guidance. We believe that we will now achieve around $11 billion in annual revenue, and we're going to tighten that diluted EPS range, earnings per share guidance range by raising the bottom end of that range to $7.60 and the top end of that diluted earnings per share range to $7.85. We believe that we still have a growing non-residential market because of all the things I just talked about on the previous page on Page 13. With respect to Industrial Service, we also believe that the oil and gas market will continue improve and that we will gain momentum into the renewables market as we exit the year. We talked about the RPOs, they're at record level. We discussed the sectors on Page 12, and that should led us execute well in the fourth quarter and well into the first half of 2023 and beyond. We believe that operating income margins will hover around on a full-year basis, 5% or a little bit above 5%. Where we end up in the range at this point of the year will depend on the following. We do expect improvement in our Electrical Construction segment operating income margin as we move to a more favorable project mix and further progress on these projects that we are just starting in the third quarter and we have a record of successful execution in these types of projects. We do expect momentum to continue from Q3 into Q4 in our Mechanical Construction segment in both revenue and operating income, driven by favorable project mix and excellent execution. Our Industrial Services segment, we believe will have a more typical fourth quarter turnaround season and our U.S. and UK Building Services will continue to perform well. You know, I think confidence is how you allocate capital, right? And at the end of the day, we have confidence in our execution and prospects, and thus we have returned nearly $677 million in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends on a year-to-date basis. We have repurchased 656.6 million in shares year-to-date with 202.3 million of such share repurchase activity in the third quarter. We have also spent $91.1 million on acquisitions in 2022, including our recent acquisition of Boston area-based Gaston Electric. And we're thrilled to have them on the team. From our CEOs of subsidiary and segment leadership teams to our service supervisors form and superintendents and project managers to our skilled craft labor, our team continues to perform well in a tough operating environment. And for that, I thank the entire EMCOR team. I appreciate all that that team does for EMCOR and for our customers every day. And with that, Jordan, we will now take questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nSean Eastman: Hi, Tony and team, thanks for taking my questions.\nTony Guzzi: Hi, Sean.\nSean Eastman: I wanted to start on margins and just a higher level question sort of putting aside the noise on margins we've seen this year. How would you characterize the bridge from sort of 2011 in the high-3% to this kind of mid-5% level we've seen over the past couple of years? How much of that is the cycle? How much of that is structural? And I realize we're not seeing slowing right now, but just in anticipation of that, I wanted to understand that move and how sustainable this level is, maybe at a lower level activity into the outer years.\nTony Guzzi: Yes, yes, Sean. I think it's always hard to separate structural versus cycle. I mean it can't just be cycle. I mean we've been at this for a while. I think a lot of it goes to what we've decided to do and what we've decided not to do, right? We are operating in an environment where we are very intentional about the kind of work we've taken and we've always have been, but the team is -- have centered around a core set of values of how we run the company and a core set of expectations on how we run the company and what we expect. And there's a couple things that are, I'd say are structural. We have bigger subsidiaries than we had in 2011, and if they got more powerful and we get more leverage out of that and we can take more scope of the work. We've also seen a move in the market to concentrate more scope on these larger projects into folks like us. We've gotten more technically sophisticated. And so you go to a structural point, right, with the maturation of BIM, where we are still back in 2011, we were probably still leading BIM contractor, where I think have increased that lead, but also we get better at it every day. And it's not just -- it's really cool to see a 3D model, but if you don't do anything it -- with it to plan your work or plan your prefabrication plan, it doesn't mean anything. We've gotten better and better at prefabrication linked to BIM and then the execution on the job site and what that means. And so what that means is we're producing more in a factory typesetting on these more sophisticated jobs and less in the field. And you can really see that on large scale mechanical projects which lead the way and our electrical contractors especially as they build up these data centers and the work they support in healthcare get better at it every day too. The other thing we did is we enhanced our position in markets that are more favorable for us to complete more of the value chain so like fire protection. So that was a build-out strategy that's been 12, 15 years in the making. We did through acquisition, we've done it through organic growth and we've done it through capital investment. Again, our folks and the leaders impede fabrication. Shambaugh & Son and S.A. Comunale are the best fire protection contractors in my mind and they had plenty of competition but they're really good at what they do and they are preferred technical choice. And, thinking about that fire protection model and why we liked it so much is labor is more flexible, it's a national union for most of the union. It's design-build product on a very specific trade, people just design to a code. We then design the system underlying in it and lends itself then well to prefabrication and it lends itself well to cruise that can dealt means and methods and apply it across multiple sites. And you never put away that they got great management, right? They really understand how to satisfy our customers and at the same time drive superior operational performance. Anything about the Mechanical Services that you go to more structural, right? We've done a lot in building services to restructure how we think about the business and what I mean by that is, if you go into building services our site-based business is a -- we have a very good business development, we have a very good execution team. We lead with self-perform and we lead with scope that makes sense for us. We're better at selecting our customers than we ever have been. People that demand technical excellence or demand consistent execution across many sites and it's really with our self-performed labor as we build that up from embryonic 2011, maybe 50, 70 guys to over 500 today of these operating engineers with some HVAC, some electrical skilled and that team has done a great job. And then you get to the Mechanical Services side, we spend a lot of time understanding mix and pricing and project management and sophistication where we actually brought as we move up the chain on these bigger energy efficiency project, it scales from our Mechanical Construction segment and some of them been into the Mechanical Services likewise, we've done the opposite and taken some of the small project skills and put them in our Mechanical Construction segment. And then finally, we're achieving these margins, right, Mark, in the phase of what would have been a less favorable mix in 2011. Industrial was our highest margin product from a lot of our time between 2008 and 2013, 2014. And we expect those margins to improve but we have done it in the other trades which are much bigger and we wouldn't have expected the mix up the way we did.\nMark Pompa: Yes. Sean, the only thing I would add to Tony's commentary and this is -- as a point of emphasis; we had a number of operating companies back in the 2011 period and periods prior to that that were performing at our consolidated levels or higher. The issue that we had is we had a number of businesses that clearly were performing below that which was driving margin dilution. So, I'm more in the structural camp because, as you know, we haven't divested of a lot of businesses over that period of time. But having said that, we've taken best practices and lessons learned and because our culture has continued to evolve which has always been strong but it continues to get stronger, we've been able to make significant inroads on how those other companies that previously were lagging those historical results were performing much better. We throw on the fact that that the margin dilutive businesses back in that 2011 time period, UK and to a lesser extent U.S. building services have continued to improve, it's been quite phenomenal. If we get the Industrial Services segment, more back in line or closer to our historical results, the earnings potential or margin potential of this business, continue to be quite favorable.\nTony Guzzi: Yes. And Sean, right now because of the mix of work and we're doing some bigger work. Where they're going to be, north of 5%. We're also worried about margin dollars, right, Mark? And we're going to drive the percentage up, Mark is a percentage guy, I'm a percentage guy and a dollar guy. We're sort of -- that's a Yin and Yan it happens in business, you go to do both. And we see pretty favorable mix. Now, one of the -- I think what's underlying your question is, if we get hit with a bad cycle, what happens? Since about 2008 when we had that recession, we've always had the mindset is our next highs have to be better than our last highs in a cycle, and our lows have to be better than the last lows. And so that's why I think when Mark says he's in the structural camp. We've done structural things to this business that we know of, and we could go through more of it, right? We talked about BIM fabricate, we talk about IT systems. We can talk about planning. We talk about how we -- how the segments have been flatten, and we can talk about all that stuff. But the key point is we're all laser-focused on having a cost structure that can compete in a tougher market. And that is something we have -- we collectively down through the subsidiary CEO level focus on every day.\nSean Eastman: All right, Thanks for that. I learned quite a bit there. And then secondly, I don't want to take anything away from the momentum we're seeing here in the business. But I wondered if we're looking here at the top-line growth and the growth in RPOs, how much you would estimate sort of the inflationary pass-through uplift is within those trends and just how we should think about your comps on these quarters going into next year to the extent inflation starts to moderate?\nTony Guzzi: Yes. From your lips to God's ears, right, that inflation starts to moderate. Look, I back in the envelope, I think we think it's hard to do it because of scopes, kinds of equipment, equipment in our mix, equipment out of our mix, some of our bigger work, we don't actually purchase the underlying equipment so that's out. Labor's actually been reasonable. I think they're in it for the long game. Our collective bargaining agreements have been reasonable. They're much more focused on what goes into the benefit package. They're much more focused on actually improving the pipeline into the trades in a lot of these local unions, which is quite robust right now. I would actually say Mark 15%, 20%.\nMark Pompa: Yes, that's -- it's less than 20%. Anywhere between that 12% to 20% range is where I would settle.\nTony Guzzi: Not something we haven't looked at, Sean. It's really hard to normalize period to period. But it would say, yes, 12% to 20% of that gains in revenue and in RPOs are probably inflation related.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Please go ahead.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey, so I kind of wanted to start exactly where you guys left off on the RPO growth. So I'm trying to think through the $1.5 billion sequential jump in RPOs, when does that work start? And what kind of confidence does that give you in 2023 revenue growth?\nTony Guzzi: Well, the works for the most part is starting now. If you think about how work gets awarded in our space, if we had some delays because of equipment and we had some delays of awards because of equipment that's part of what you saw in the third quarter. When this customer provided equipment, they delayed the award. We knew we were getting it, but they delayed the award, as we talked about. Adam, we don't comment on 2023 right now. But look, we have record RPO levels, we're in the fourth quarter, we expect a good start to 2023.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. And the -- can you just kind of repeat your -- there was a comment, Q3 was a little bit down in industry -- in Industrial seasonally down. You talked about a better Q4, a better Q1. I guess, can you talk a little bit more about that kind of the next six months in Industrial?\nTony Guzzi: The next six months should be okay, right? Because we're in the fourth quarter turnaround season, we're going into the first quarter turnaround season. We have no reason to believe that those -- well, we're in the one, right? So we know that most of that schedule is getting executed. And we think most of the first quarter will get executed. But we're at record frac spreads, and we have incredible external pressure on these refiners to keep operating. We don't make those decisions. We plan for them. We are well-positioned to support our customers, and we also think some of our renewable projects will start to come online as we exit the year into the first quarter of 2023.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. And then, lastly, thoughts on capital allocation from here both M&A and buybacks?\nTony Guzzi: I'll let Mark take that.\nMark Pompa: Yes. With regards to the buyback program, clearly, you could see in the Q what the remaining authorization is. We don't comment on our repurchase strategies as we go-forward, as you know. But we certainly have the authorization to take advantage of that if we chose to do that. With regards to the M&A pipeline and Tony is certainly going to jump in, we continue to have an active pipeline. But as other things that we've commented on this call, ultimately, we do not determine if something is actionable or not. There's obviously a lot of uncertainty as people are looking at the future for all the reasons that have been discussed previously on this call and some of the earlier questions we've had today. But this year has been relatively slow to-date. I would like to think as we move into 2023; we would like to see activity pull up.\nTony Guzzi: Yes. I mean, we like what we did so far year-to-date. We wish we have done a little more. We see continued good opportunities. We see it in our Electrical segment. We see in our Mechanical Construction segment. We see in Building Services. Industrial is more organic growth. We have the capabilities to support our customers. And even on UK, we could see an interesting acquisition or two. The bar for us is fairly high, right? We have good organic growth opportunities. We still have capabilities and geographies we'd like to fill, and we have people that want to be owned by EMCOR. We have great success in people that are trying to move their life's work to us. That's a better scenario for us. We earn well in excess of our cost of capital, and we make very fair deals with the sellers. We don't -- we're not bargain hunters, and we're not going to be the people that are going to go that squeeze the absolute last dollar out of the transaction. It's just not how it works when someone wants to be part of our team going forward. We do a lot of small acquisitions you never hear about that build a branch or allow us to take a mechanical service contractor in the West from a $40 million in 2002 to $300 million today. And so we're very intentional about that M&A dollars. Do I think there is a $1 billion deal in our offing? No, I don't. I think that we will continue to operate well with the $40 million to $300 million acquisition, and I think we have plenty of opportunities there over a multi-year period.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nBrent Thielman: Hey Tony, in the 10-Q, you highlighted the manufacturing sector in regard to Electrical segment growth. And then within that, kind of the first bullet was transmission and distribution projects. And I was just wondering if you could clarify. Is that some of the stuff you're talking about or --?\nTony Guzzi: Yes, that would be around renewables and substations that support renewables. That would be located there. And it would also be on substations supporting manufacturing clients as they build out their facilities. Yes, that's mainly what that is.\nBrent Thielman: Yes. And then the EV battery plant opportunities also fall into that category and manufacturing separately?\nTony Guzzi: Yes. Yes, yes.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. Perfect. And then, I guess, Tony, on the -- again, on the Electrical segment, the challenges you've had to work through this year weigh a bit on the margins? Are you effectively complete with those jobs? Are you still working through them?\nTony Guzzi: Most of them will be complete by the end of the year. We have one more that will be sitting out there. Obviously, at the end of every reporting period, we take our best view on that job. So we think we know where we are. This is not hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of work that need to be completed. It's probably around $50 million to $60 million of work to get completed. This is work that for the most part, was taken between 2015 and 2017, like Mark said, under very different operating assumptions. It got delayed for some design issues initially, then some pandemic issues, then some supply chain issues. And it's work that we completed in the West Coast, and we will finish those jobs. We will seek our contractual entitlement and we will move on. It's not -- like I said, this isn't hundreds of millions of dollars of backlog or hundreds of millions of dollars of work. That work will be -- other than one job, will be complete mostly this year, and maybe a couple of things will dribble into the first quarter.\nBrent Thielman: Yes. Understood. And then last just the strong Building Services performance. I mean, again, this quarter. How much do you attribute to sort of these positive or favorable seasonal trends? I know that unusually warm weather, which I assume helped to some degree. And then what you attribute to what the core business is doing, right, maybe some of the secular trends around the business.\nTony Guzzi: I think most of its secular trends on what the business is doing right. The size we're at now, with their profitability now, we love warm weather. We've been -- we don't --\nMark Pompa: We love warm weather, we love snow, but it doesn't move the needle for the performance of that segment.\nTony Guzzi: Not like it used to, because of the size. I think what really is driving the performance is really paying -- what we didn't talk about, right? Because if things are good, you don't have to whine, right? But we didn't talk about the fuel headwind that Building Services segment had it is not zero. I mean, Mark, $3 million to $5 million?\nMark Pompa: Yes.\nTony Guzzi: Yes. I mean, $0.04, $0.05 a share of headwind coming out of fuel just in Building Services, and you probably double that across the business. Now as the year goes on, when we recouped it as our pricing caught up. We don't talk about all the planning we have to do on what we're supposed to be short-cycle projects that get pushed out and what that means for their workforce planning and how we're not absorbing. I would argue they're performing at these levels with less than optimal labor utilization on the project mix side. But offsetting that is unbelievable execution on the repair service side, which is really, really strong, which is clearly highly skilled labor and the utilization and the pricing around that, coupled with the best execution we've ever seen in our commercial site-based business. And also as we even start-up new customers, as we renew customers, and we're really -- and more importantly, we're delivering for our customers there. I mean, that's a business where you really have to work with the customer on the budgeting and year-over-year productivity and cost reductions in an inflationary environment and getting through that takes a lot of scale, and that team is executing. As well as the UK team, I would put those two together, operating in really, really difficult environments for our customers, and really delivering for them.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Noelle Dilts with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nNoelle Dilts: Hi, thank you. Just I was hoping you could just comment a little bit on how you're thinking about the longer-term implications of higher interest rates and what that means for -- I should say higher interest rates and also just higher costs overall. I mean, obviously, your demand is exceptionally strong, you're seeing great trends. But as you look forward, how concerned are you that you could start to see slowdown in certain sectors of construction overall? Thanks.\nTony Guzzi: Yes. I mean look, that's something -- this is a seasoned management team. And so we're always aware of planning for the inevitable slowdown, right? I do think if you go to the sectors I talked about on Page 13, I mean there's a real trench, right? And there may be blips along the way, but you can't get out of the way of what are really great macro trends. But people, oh, is a secular macro trends, you have to have planned and you have had to build the labor force to take advantage of those secular trends well before the secular trend happen. So there's really nothing that's happening right now that surprises us, except for maybe the speed of some of the dollars in energy transition. So we feel good about that. The second thing is, if you think about it from an underlying, what are some things that are really things we didn't have much to do with that are going to help those secular trends? There's been three or four pieces of legislation over the last couple of years that will help keep some of that demand solidified and also solidified on terms that are good for a highly skilled contractor that always pays prevailing wages. And so if you think about it, the first one was the CARES Act. Mark talked a little bit about that. That's going to drive underlying demand in the institutional market. That's the biggest part for us, schools, right, and other institutional buildings to do building upgrades. Now that was 2021. You thought it was all spent. No, it's not. Nothing almost got spent in 2021, it can't, right? You pass it, it takes a lot of plan. Then you get to 2022, Mark talked about that being some of the drivers for our small project work in the mix. Now you get to 2023, we think we'll see even more of that. Actually, I think that will be near the peak year for the execution of those projects. Then you move to the infrastructure, probably not that big of a deal for us overall with the mix of work we do. We'll get some effect, right? We do have some transportation capability to do lighting and driver information systems. Some airport upgrades will happen that we'll be part of, and we're doing that today. And some port upgrades will happen that we'll be part of it. But generally that's a civil infrastructure build, and we're not civil contractors. Then you move to the CHIPS Act. Look, those customers are strong and financially strong to begin with. What this does is put a base under that so that they know there's some long-term capital contribution. It also sets it up on terms that are good for contractors like us. Whether they be union or non-union, you're going to pay prevailing wages and you're going to do that work here in the U.S., right? Most of those sites were designed and developed and everything else before the Act, but the Act helped strengthen the implementation of those projects. And we're positioned in a lot of those markets. The last one is the IRA. What that helps with some of these energy transition and energy efficiency. And again, we will participate in that. So yes, there's going to be speed bumps along the way. But when you're in the businesses that we are, and really, I think that the number of people that can do what we do on some of these larger projects, there's plenty of them, there's competition. But you have to have the skill to get in the project early and do the technical planning. And then they have to believe that you have the prefab and BIM capability to do the design assist to move that project along and then you can invariably flex up and down through workforce planning and execution.\nNoelle Dilts: Great. That's very helpful. And I guess, second, just going back to your -- the discussion on the impact of inflation on RPO. Just to make sure we're thinking about this correctly. I mean, would you -- should we think of a lot of that inflation is just being passed through? So it might have a dilutive impact on margin? And obviously, we know that there have been a lot of other things that have impacted margins this year that should not -- that you should've passed though, so that will be a positive impact. But just kind of curious how to think about those spend?\nTony Guzzi: I'm not sure, going forward, how dilutive the impact is of inflation, right? We have a margin. We have to make on our labor and our procurement of those materials.\nNoelle Dilts: Okay.\nTony Guzzi: I think what your -- what has happened, right, is more of the supply chain disruption is more a problem for us than the inflation. Yes, we passed the inflation on. But we also look to seek to make our margin, right? It's not passed on without making a margin. What the real issue is the supply chain disruptions. Now part I think we believe, as a management team is we're now in a spot where things are getting delivered, right? So we waited, we waited, we waited. There was the disruption, which we foreshadowed way back in our second quarter 2021 call. We had some things priced differently. We're working through it, working through it. And now we're getting major equipment delivered. We're putting it on the site. We put that into our planning. Are we building things optimally the way we'd want to build them? Of course not. But we have figured out how to work around that. In some ways, you're almost treating the installation of some of the major subsystems, as you would on a replacement job. You're doing everything else first. I mean, because the availability of pipe and wire and more commodity-type materials has actually been pretty good, and the price has come down actually. So you put the bundle together, might it have a minor impact, Mark, to keep things tamped down.\nMark Pompa: Yes. I mean, the law of large numbers, right? For say a discussion marking something up 5%, right? And that the percentage -- the number grows, it's more of the total contract. It could be dilutive, but it's not driving the advantage.\nTony Guzzi: It's not -- it's not driving it.\nMark Pompa: Yes.\nNoelle Dilts: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nTony Guzzi: Anybody else, no?\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tony Guzzi for any closing remarks.\nTony Guzzi: All right. Thank you all very much. Stay safe, and we won't be talking to you. So have a great Thanksgiving.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Mark Pompa",
            "content": "Thank you, Tony, and good morning to everyone on the call today. For those accessing this presentation via the webcast, we are now on Slide 7. Over the next several slides, I will augment Tony's opening commentary on EMCOR's third quarter performance as well as provide a brief update on our year-to-date results through September 30. All financial information referenced this morning is derived from our consolidated financial statements included in both of our earnings release announcement and Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier today. So let's revisit and expand a review of EMCOR's third quarter performance. Consolidated revenues of $2.83 billion are up $304.7 million or 12.1% over quarter three 2021 and represent a new all-time quarterly revenue record for EMCOR. Each of our reportable segment experienced quarter-over-quarter revenue growth other than our United Kingdom Building Services segment which was negatively impacted by unfavorable exchange rate movements during the quarter. Excluding $32.8 million of revenues attributable to businesses acquired pertaining to the time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in last year's quarter, revenues for the third quarter of 2022 increased approximately $272 million or 10.8% when compared to the third quarter of 2021. The specifics of each reportable segment are as follows: United States Electrical Construction segment revenues of $633.4 million increased a $102.4 million or 19.3% from quarter three 2021. Excluding incremental acquisition revenue this segments revenue grew a strong 13.1% organically quarter-over-quarter. Increased project activity within the commercial markets sector, inclusive of the telecommunications and technology submarket sectors as well as revenue growth from projects supporting both sustainable energy solutions and other traditional energy sources within the manufacturing market sector were the main drivers of the period-over-period increase. In addition, this segment continues to provide electrical solutions to our healthcare clients where they remain strength and demand for large capital projects. United States Mechanical Construction revenues of $1.12 billion increased a $113 million or 11.2% from quarter three 2021. Revenue growth during the quarter was driven by increases within the commercial, institutional, and water and wastewater market sectors. With respect to commercial sector revenue growth we are benefiting from increased project activity for customers within the semiconductor industry as well as customers within the biotech, life sciences and pharmaceutical industries. These projects include both traditional and mechanical construction as well as fire protection services. In addition, within the commercial market sector we continue to see increase in demand for our fire protection services notably from our e-commerce customers as they expand their warehouse and distribution facilities. From an institutional market sector perspective, revenue growth was geographically broad-based and included increased revenues from a number of schools, universities, and other educational customers, including those which have received funding for HVAC repair and replacement under the CARES Act. On the other hand, our water and wastewater revenues remain concentrated within the Southern United States where we are supporting the increasing demand for potable drinking water and the treatment of wastewater given the shift in population in that region. Third quarter revenues from EMCOR's combined United States Construction business of $1.75 billion increased $215.4 million or 14% with 11.9% of such growth being organic. This combined revenue performance as well as the revenue performance of each of our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments represent new all-time quarterly revenue records. Consistent with last quarter, the achievement of these records have been accomplished while also increasing remaining performance obligations, which also represent all-time highs for each of our construction segments. Tony has already commented on our RPO development during the quarter and he will be providing more detailed commentary at the conclusion of this financial section. United States Building Services quarterly revenues of $710.7 million increased $86.1 million or 13.8%. Revenue growth was generated within this segments Mechanical Services and commercial site-based services divisions. Within Mechanical Services, we continue to benefit from strong demand for HVAC retrofit projects in building automation and control services with an emphasis on improving building efficiency, energy consumption, and indoor air quality. In addition, we are experiencing growth in service repair and maintenance volumes as supply chain delays have resulted in the need to extend the useful lives of existing HVAC equipment in instances when replacement equipment is not readily available. With respect to the segments commercial site-based services division, new customer additions, as well as scope or site expansion and increased project activity with existing customers were the drivers of the quarterly increase in revenues. EMCOR's Industrial Services segment revenues of $247.2 million, increased $15 million or 6.5%. Although, the quarterly growth is not as significant as that of our last two quarters, we were encouraged to see solid mid-single-digit revenue growth as quarter three represents this segments seasonally slowest period as Tony previously mentioned. This revenue growth was despite the headwinds created by refinery utilization well in excess of 90% during the majority of the quarter, which can often limit the opportunities to provide field services as our customers are reluctant to take down the refineries for any extended maintenance. United Kingdom Building Services revenues of $117.7 million decreased $11.8 million. As previously mentioned, this revenue contraction was entirely due to unfavorable exchange rate movements for the British pound versus the United States dollar, which is masking revenue growth on a local currency basis. This segment continues to see strong project demand from the commercial market sector customers inclusive of the telecommunications submarket sector. Please turn to Slide 8. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $263.1 million represent 9.3% of revenues and compares to $243.9 million or 9.7% of revenues in the year ago period. The current year's quarter includes approximately $3.7 million in incremental expenses from businesses acquired inclusive of intangible asset amortization, resulting in an organic quarter-over-quarter increase in SG&A of $15.5 million. This quarter's organic growth and SG&A expenses is primarily related to increased personnel costs due to both increased headcount to support our organic revenue growth as well as higher quarterly incentive compensation expense due to improved year-over-year performance at certain of our operations. Additionally, we continue to experience growth in travel and entertainment expenses as our employee business travel continues to resume normalcy. Despite the growth in SG&A dollars, we have seen a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of revenues as we successfully leverage our cost structure. As I mentioned last quarter, we continue to maintain discipline with overhead investment and will seek incremental efficiencies and economies of scale as we drive future revenue growth. Reported operating income for the quarter of $150.1 million or 5.3% of revenues compares to operating income of $137.4 million or 5.4% of revenues in 2021's third quarter. Our $150.1 million of quarterly operating income eclipses EMCOR's all-time quarterly OI record set in 2021's fourth quarter. Our operating margin of 5.3% represents a sequential improvement from that of quarter two, which was also sequentially higher than quarter one. Despite inflationary pressures and supply chain headwinds EMCOR continues to execute at a high-level, producing strong operating results and margin conversion on a revenue base, which continues to grow. Specific quarterly performance by segment is as follows: our U.S. Electrical Construction segment operating income of $35.6 million, decreased $8.7 million from the comparable 2021 period. Reported operating margin of 5.6% represents a reduction from the 8.3% in last year's quarter, the decrease in both operating income and operating margin is due to a less favorable project mix within the commercial, institutional and transportation market sectors, coupled with certain discrete project write-downs totaling $10.5 million during the quarter, which negatively impacted the segment's operating margin by 170 basis points. These losses were due in part to supply chain disruptions as well as project completion delays and time extensions beyond our control. The majority of these projects were bid a number of years ago under different economic conditions where the extent of these supply chain disruptions as well as current inflationary pressures and escalating material prices could not have been contemplated. We continue to evaluate our contractual rights and are pursuing recovery were permitted. Aided by the increase in segment revenues, third quarter operating income of our U.S. Mechanical Construction segment of $91 million represents a $10.2 million increase from last year's quarter, while quarterly operating margin of 8.1% is modestly improved from 8% in 2021's third quarter. This improvement on operating margin is despite having a larger number of active projects within the manufacturing and water and wastewater sectors where we are either acting as a construction manager or general contractor. In these cases, our percentage of self-performed labor is less than a typical EMCOR construction project, thereby resulting in a lower gross margin profile. Operating income for U.S. Building Services is $45.6 million or 6.4% of revenues, which represents a substantial $12.7 million or $38.7 million -- sorry, 38.7% increase period-over-period with a 110 basis point in expansion and operating margin. Driven by the performance of our Mechanical Services division, this segment is benefiting from both favorable project execution as well as the impact of certain pricing adjustments aimed at better aligning our billing rates with the increased operating costs we have experienced. Our U.S. Industrial Services segment operating loss of $1.4 million represents a $1.6 million improvement from the $3 million loss reported in 2021's third quarter. As I referenced earlier, quarter three is historically our Industrial segments seasonally weakest quarter. Additionally, the delay or deferral into future periods of certain customer turnaround projects, which were anticipated to commence in September of this year, resulted in a shortfall when compared to internal expectations for the quarter. UK Building Services operating income of $8.4 million or 7.1% of revenues represents an increase of $1.8 million and a 200 basis point improvement in operating margin quarter-over-quarter. This improved operating income performance is despite the foreign exchange headwinds mentioned during my revenue commentary, which reduced the segments reported operating income by $1.4 million in the quarter. This segment continues to benefit from a more favorable mix of project work when compared to the prior year. We are now on Slide 9. Additional financial items of significance for the quarter are not addressed in the previous slides or as follows: Quarter three gross profit of $413.2 million represents an all-time gross profit record for the company and is higher than the comparable 2021 quarter by $31.9 million or 8.4%. However, gross margin of 14.6% is lower than last year's third quarter primarily due to the impact the project write-downs within our Electrical Construction segment, which negatively impacted our consolidated gross profit margin by 40 basis points during the quarter. Although, the quarter-over-quarter gross margin compare is unfavorable, 14.6% of gross margin is sequentially higher than our first two quarters of 2022 and the 50 basis point year-over-year reduction represents the smallest quarterly variance to-date in the current year. Diluted earnings per common share in the third quarter of 2022 was $2.16 as compared to $1.85 per share for the prior year period. This third quarter EPS performance represents a new quarterly earnings per share record for EMCOR due to the combination of net income growth and a reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding given our continued share repurchase activity during the year. Please turn to Slide 10. With my quarter commentary out of the way, let's touch on some highlights with respect to EMCOR's results for the first nine months of 2022. Revenues of $8.13 billion represent an increase of $862.9 million or 11.9% of which 10.3% of such revenue growth was generated from organic activities. As a result of our exceptional performance over the last two quarters, our year-to-date operating income of $387.7 million approximate to that of 2021, which is quite impressive given the headwinds previously discussed. Operating margin for the year-to-date period is 4.8% and we continue to reduce the year-over-year gap, which is now only 50 basis points. On a combined basis, our U.S. Construction operations have experienced sequential quarterly improvement on operating margin throughout the year, and all of our other segments are reporting nine-month operating margins, which are either equal to or greater than that of the corresponding prior year period. Year-to-date diluted earnings per share was $5.50 and represents an increase of 6.4% from the $5.17 of EPS reported in 2021's nine-month to-date period. Although not shown on this slide, my last comment on our year-to-date results is with respect to our strong operating cash flow. In the nine-month period, we have generated $238.4 million of operating cash flow, which represents a substantial improvement over last year. Although, we had a slow start during the first six months of 2022, we generated $257.2 million of operating cash during the third quarter. Despite our strong organic revenue growth to-date in 2022, and the resulting requirement for working capital investment, our subsidiary management and project teams have done an excellent job of maintaining discipline in their project and service contract administration resulting in great cash conversion. We are now on Slide 11. EMCOR's balance sheet remains strong and we continue to be in a position to invest in our business, return capital to shareholders, and pursue strategic M&A transactions. Despite the significant operating cash flow I just mentioned, our cash on hand has declined from year-end 2021 as a result of cash used in investing and financing activities during the first nine months of 2022. Notably, we utilized $656.6 million for the repurchase of our common stock, have spent $91.1 million on acquisitions, and returned $20 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends. This activity was funded by our cash on hand as well as $170 million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Resulting primarily from a decrease in cash, coupled with an increase in our net contract liability position, our working capital balance has decreased by nearly $289 million from year-end 2021. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable, given the revenue growth we continue to experience. In terms of other fluctuations within our balance sheet, the $26.5 million increase in goodwill since December of last year was entirely a result of the acquisitions completed by us thus far in 2022. Net identifiable intangible assets have increased by approximately $16.6 million as the additional intangible assets recognized in connection with the aforementioned acquisitions were partially offset by amortization expense during the period. Total debt exclusive of operating lease liabilities has increased by nearly $170 million since December, given the borrowings under our revolving credit facility that I previously mentioned. As a result of this incremental debt coupled with the reduction in our shareholders' equity due to our capital allocation activities, EMCOR's debt to capitalization ratio has increased from 10.4% at year-end 2021 to 18.9% at September 30, 2022. We remain committed to our long-term capital allocation strategy and with our consistent free cash flow generation, along with our liquidity, inclusive of revolving credit capacity, we continue to remain flexibility in our ability to execute against our strategic objectives. With my portion of this morning slide presentation completed, I will now give the call back to Tony. Tony? Yes. Sean, the only thing I would add to Tony's commentary and this is -- as a point of emphasis; we had a number of operating companies back in the 2011 period and periods prior to that that were performing at our consolidated levels or higher. The issue that we had is we had a number of businesses that clearly were performing below that which was driving margin dilution. So, I'm more in the structural camp because, as you know, we haven't divested of a lot of businesses over that period of time. But having said that, we've taken best practices and lessons learned and because our culture has continued to evolve which has always been strong but it continues to get stronger, we've been able to make significant inroads on how those other companies that previously were lagging those historical results were performing much better. We throw on the fact that that the margin dilutive businesses back in that 2011 time period, UK and to a lesser extent U.S. building services have continued to improve, it's been quite phenomenal. If we get the Industrial Services segment, more back in line or closer to our historical results, the earnings potential or margin potential of this business, continue to be quite favorable. Yes, that's -- it's less than 20%. Anywhere between that 12% to 20% range is where I would settle. Yes. With regards to the buyback program, clearly, you could see in the Q what the remaining authorization is. We don't comment on our repurchase strategies as we go-forward, as you know. But we certainly have the authorization to take advantage of that if we chose to do that. With regards to the M&A pipeline and Tony is certainly going to jump in, we continue to have an active pipeline. But as other things that we've commented on this call, ultimately, we do not determine if something is actionable or not. There's obviously a lot of uncertainty as people are looking at the future for all the reasons that have been discussed previously on this call and some of the earlier questions we've had today. But this year has been relatively slow to-date. I would like to think as we move into 2023; we would like to see activity pull up. We love warm weather, we love snow, but it doesn't move the needle for the performance of that segment. Yes. Yes. I mean, the law of large numbers, right? For say a discussion marking something up 5%, right? And that the percentage -- the number grows, it's more of the total contract. It could be dilutive, but it's not driving the advantage. Yes."

            "name": "Tony Guzzi",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everybody. I will discuss our third quarter results in my opening comments and Mark will cover the third quarter and year-to-date results in greater detail. My opening commentary will focus on Pages 4 through 6. We delivered another strong quarter at EMCOR. Revenues grew to $2.83 billion with 12.1% overall revenue growth and 10.8% organic revenue growth, continuing the strong organic revenue growth we have earned over the last three years. I believe that this achievement, a consistent, strong organic revenue growth and the underlying profit growth is a testament to our positioning in certain key markets and a result of our long-term acquisition programs, capital spending, leader development programs, and customer and sector focus. Further, our gross margin gap versus prior year performance had closed to a smallest gap this year. This shows that we are narrowing the impact of the supply chain disruptions and inflation as we price, plan and execute our project and service work. We grew operating income to $150.1 million with 5.3% operating income margins. We had strong SG&A leverage with SG&A margin at 9.3% of revenues. Our operating cash flow was exceptional at $257 million in the quarter. Our diluted earnings per share was $2.16 per share compared to a $1.85 per share for the third quarter of 2021. This is excellent overall performance, especially against the challenges of continued supply chain disruptions and inflation. These issues are still present and it does present operating challenges that we have to work through. I am always amazed at the resourcefulness, flexibility and depth operating skills of our field leadership team as they plan and execute around an ever-changing and volatile environment and achieve excellent execution for our customers. I will now cover some highlights by segment. We continue to have very strong revenue growth in our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments. Our Mechanical Construction segment revenues grew at 11.2% in the quarter and most of that growth in this segment was organic. Electrical Construction segment revenues grew at 19.3% with 13.1% organic revenue growth. Operating income margin of 5.6% in the Electrical Construction segment was challenged by product mix, timing and some legacy transportation project issues. We continue to see very strong performance from our data center and high-tech manufacturing projects and are experiencing sizable growth in our commercial RPOs driven by these project awards. We expect Electrical operating income margins to rebound sequentially as we finish the year and move into 2023 as our mix improves as projects delayed by extended lead times for major equipment commenced into the execution phase. Operating income margin in our Mechanical Construction segment was 8.1%, driven by exceptional execution in the commercial market sector on several semi-conductor, pharma and life science projects. Our Mechanical Construction segment also performed well with respect to our fire protection offerings, what cuts across all geographies and sectors of performance. Supply chain and inflation challenges continue and will remain part of our project planning and execution through the balance of 2022 and well into 2023. Our U.S. Building Services segment had an excellent quarter with an operating income margin of 6.4% and 38.7% operating income growth, driven in part by revenues of $710.7 million which represented 13.8% revenue growth quarter-over-quarter and that was all mostly organic revenue growth. We had strong repair service, HVAC project, and energy efficiency project execution. Driving this growth is the underlying demand for our offerings. We leave this quarter with record RPOs as we continue to benefit from our customers' demand for energy efficiency upgrades in indoor air quality improvement. It was a great quarter for Building Services. Our Industrial Services segment faced a headwind of delayed turnaround projects as our customers pushed some work into the fourth quarter. Third quarter is typically a seasonally weak quarter in the Industrial Services segment. And we believe we will continue to see improved performance in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of 2023. We are also hampered in this quarter by delayed startup and awards on several solar opportunities that we are well-positioned to execute as supply chain disruptions ease. Our United Kingdom Building Services segment continues to excel with 7.1% operating income margins, favorable project mix, and excellent customer delivery. Our team continues to perform well against the backdrop of very challenging economic environment and foreign exchange headwinds. We exit the quarter with a strong balance sheet, RPOs Remaining Performance Obligations at a record level of $7.1 billion versus $5.4 billion a year ago and $5.6 billion at the end of 2021. With that I'll turn the call over to Mark and he'll go over the quarter in detail. Thanks, Mark. Well done. And I'm on Page 12, Remaining Performance Obligations or RPOs. And we have diverse RPOs of $7.10 billion an all-time record. We continue to be successful on winning new work and winning matters, as the company we had another strong project bookings quarter. We've experienced healthy demand throughout 2022 across our segments and many market sectors. And while we have always described our business as not predicated on month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter, it ebbs and flows with projects and projects award. It is noticeable that our RPOs total has increased in eight consecutive quarters fueled overwhelmingly by organic RPO growth, and that's with strong underlying organic revenue growth. Total company RPOs at the end of the third quarter were $7.1 billion or up $1.7 billion or 32% over the September 2021 total of $5.4 billion. From the end of last year, RPOs are up $1.5 billion or 27%. Additionally, we booked $641 million of work in the three months since June 30. The complexion of our RPO portfolio has changed a bit over the last 12 months or so. In general, length is going up of projects as projects scope increases and that's because of supply chain issues, which remain elevated and also the technical complexity and labor complexity of the what kinds of projects we're winning at the higher end of the project the larger projects. When you have those complex supply issues, coupled with the ability to track and retain and deploy the right mix of skilled craft labor, and the ever-present technical demand of projects, many of our customers are looking for the contractor or us that could be a preferred choice to complete some of these technically sophisticated projects where they may be hyperscale data centers, food processing plants, semiconductor fabs, hospitals, pharma plants, biolife plants, healthcare facilities, or broad-based energy efficiency upgrades. Together, our two domestic construction segments experienced strong project growth year-over-year with RPOs increasing just under $1.5 billion or 34%. U.S. Building Services RPOs increased $276 million from the year ago period, or 33% that's one point -- and is now at about $1.1 billion and small to mid-size project work and also service work. This call -- this quarter, we saw the increase in our Mechanical Service division and the reorder or renewal of several facilities maintenance contract in its site-based services division. As I mentioned last quarter, these extended lead times for HVAC equipment combined with a push for energy efficiency and improved building wellness is resulting in our customers asking us to retrofit and when we can't retrofit on time, as Mark said, we're repairing their equipment. The additionally -- we think about the lack of equipment ability, it is driving our repair service work because equipment still needs to run. In my opinion, lead time for applied HVAC equipment will continue to be extended well into 2023. Moving to the right side of the page where we have our RPOs broken down by market sector. As I mentioned earlier, quarter three was a strong booking quarter, supported by RPO increases in all sectors against water and wastewater and we have good underlying trend in the markets where we compete water and wastewater, they tend to be more episodic awards. Market sectors were led by project awards in our broadly defined commercial sector. That includes numerous data center projects, semiconductor projects and projects, customers within the biotech life science and pharma industries. It's not yesterday's or 10 years ago commercial market sector. Finishing our market sector year-over-year growth healthcare up 33%, institutional up 24%, and short duration projects for most of the retrofit work and if energy efficiency work is up 34%. Partially offsetting that was minor decreases in water and wastewater industrial manufacturing and a decrease in transportation RPOs. What I said last quarter still rings true today. I continue to like the balance and breadth from both the businesses segment and market perspective and a geographic perspective of our RPO portfolio as we closeout 2022 and we move into 2023. I'm going to talk about the next slide Page 13. And I've talked about this because it is some underlying trends that are driving their business and our business and they look like they have legs well into the future. And look some of these awards come in bulky and episodic for the bigger work like data centers and semiconductor fabs and some of it is more quick hitting like the indoor air quality mechanical services work. But you go to data centers and semiconductor fabs, we see good demand and we see that continuing well into 2023. And we're positioned in all the right geographic markets with the right people. Are we in every one of them? No, but we're in enough of them to make a difference. There's strong demand for electrical systems. When you think about data centers, bigger electrical systems, smaller mechanical systems today, still big content on both parts. Fire protection goes across everything. If you think about semiconductor fabs for EMCOR, it flips, stronger mechanical demand, lesser electrical demand, again, fire protection demand across it. Fire protection, we can cover the entire geography of the U.S. for these opportunities. Industrial manufacturing and some of this shows up in our commercial because that's where our pharma life sciences and biotech is, we see strong opportunities and really what's driving that. One is new products, new facilities, strengthening supply chains and the reassuring of manufacturing and also still relocation from higher cost states to lower cost states. Healthcare, this for us is outpatient healthcare facilities, hospitals and large physician medical office buildings. These are both upgrade opportunities as well as new construction opportunities as people seek more flexibility in their healthcare systems and pandemic taught people a lot. And also just the aging of America and the aging of these facilities are driving this demand. We put a new one in here and energy transition and transportation. And if you think about it, I heard it best from one of the big utility CEOs today. He said all of the above strategy and EMCOR can participate in an all of the above strategy. It's not an either/or energy demand is increasing. If you think about what's happening with healthcare facilities, data centers, semiconductor fabs, and industrial manufacturing resource, we're not going to be using less energy in America. And so we need all sources of energy to excel and you're coal will phase out. And so you're going to need natural gas to supplement the renewables. Nuclear, they're opening I guess they're fueling the first nuclear plant in Georgia. Not a big market for us, but on the periphery we will support nuclear plants. The one in Georgia is getting built, be the first one in a generation. Energy transition, we do participate in the solar and wind markets. In some very specific transmission and distribution opportunities, but also in the emplacement of the solar fields, we should have been doing more of that work today. We do that in both the Electrical segment and we do it in the Industrial Services segment because of the positioning of the assets and the capability. We've learned if some of those oil and gas guys are great solar builders. They're very good at it. And then you got the whole value chain of automotive. From all the way back at the mines, the lithium mines and the transportation, all the way through manufacturing and battery, all the way through to EVs and the new plants that are being built to the distribution centers that are now putting industrial scale. So we'll look, is EMCOR going to be the person that's going to build the EVs charging stations at rest stops, probably not. We'll do it episodically or we'll do it within a local market. We are the people that are doing it at the major distribution hubs. Those are high intensity electrical projects that are almost substation grade installations. And then that'll move all the way down through how you continue to do battery storage, which is a best embryonic at this stage. So and then you've got all underlying demand charges. And what's going to have to happen with the gas system to support the renewable grid. I'm actually quite bullish on how we participate on that over a 20-year time horizon. It is not a three-year project. This is a 20 to 30-year transition. And beyond the transition, we're going to need more energy. And that's not to say that we're not going to continue to support the downstream refining petrochemical and upstream market in oil and gas. Water and wastewater, Mark touched on it. We're mainly concentrated in the Southeast and even more so in Florida. There is a couple of things going on there. You had consent decree work that was going on with our some of our customers. Now you have strong underlying demand if more people moved into those states. And the demand for fresh water, wastewater treatment, is continuing to increase. Mechanical Services, there is none better than EMCOR mechanical service work. There is nobody better at putting energy efficiency project in. And we have the scale, we have the people, we have the technical know-how, and we have the OEM relationships and controls product offerings to make it happen in a big way not only from an efficiency upgrade standpoint, but from an indoor air quality. And finally, we're the best fire protection contractor in the United States bar none. We're good. We can do large projects. We can do small projects. We can do service. We have the fab capability to deliver that at a cost that's competitive for our customers on the most technically sophisticated projects in the country. And all that other stuff I talked about is being built up. Now, let's go to closing on Pages 14 to 15 and what most of you care about is we took up guidance. We believe that we will now achieve around $11 billion in annual revenue, and we're going to tighten that diluted EPS range, earnings per share guidance range by raising the bottom end of that range to $7.60 and the top end of that diluted earnings per share range to $7.85. We believe that we still have a growing non-residential market because of all the things I just talked about on the previous page on Page 13. With respect to Industrial Service, we also believe that the oil and gas market will continue improve and that we will gain momentum into the renewables market as we exit the year. We talked about the RPOs, they're at record level. We discussed the sectors on Page 12, and that should led us execute well in the fourth quarter and well into the first half of 2023 and beyond. We believe that operating income margins will hover around on a full-year basis, 5% or a little bit above 5%. Where we end up in the range at this point of the year will depend on the following. We do expect improvement in our Electrical Construction segment operating income margin as we move to a more favorable project mix and further progress on these projects that we are just starting in the third quarter and we have a record of successful execution in these types of projects. We do expect momentum to continue from Q3 into Q4 in our Mechanical Construction segment in both revenue and operating income, driven by favorable project mix and excellent execution. Our Industrial Services segment, we believe will have a more typical fourth quarter turnaround season and our U.S. and UK Building Services will continue to perform well. You know, I think confidence is how you allocate capital, right? And at the end of the day, we have confidence in our execution and prospects, and thus we have returned nearly $677 million in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends on a year-to-date basis. We have repurchased 656.6 million in shares year-to-date with 202.3 million of such share repurchase activity in the third quarter. We have also spent $91.1 million on acquisitions in 2022, including our recent acquisition of Boston area-based Gaston Electric. And we're thrilled to have them on the team. From our CEOs of subsidiary and segment leadership teams to our service supervisors form and superintendents and project managers to our skilled craft labor, our team continues to perform well in a tough operating environment. And for that, I thank the entire EMCOR team. I appreciate all that that team does for EMCOR and for our customers every day. And with that, Jordan, we will now take questions. Hi, Sean. Yes, yes, Sean. I think it's always hard to separate structural versus cycle. I mean it can't just be cycle. I mean we've been at this for a while. I think a lot of it goes to what we've decided to do and what we've decided not to do, right? We are operating in an environment where we are very intentional about the kind of work we've taken and we've always have been, but the team is -- have centered around a core set of values of how we run the company and a core set of expectations on how we run the company and what we expect. And there's a couple things that are, I'd say are structural. We have bigger subsidiaries than we had in 2011, and if they got more powerful and we get more leverage out of that and we can take more scope of the work. We've also seen a move in the market to concentrate more scope on these larger projects into folks like us. We've gotten more technically sophisticated. And so you go to a structural point, right, with the maturation of BIM, where we are still back in 2011, we were probably still leading BIM contractor, where I think have increased that lead, but also we get better at it every day. And it's not just -- it's really cool to see a 3D model, but if you don't do anything it -- with it to plan your work or plan your prefabrication plan, it doesn't mean anything. We've gotten better and better at prefabrication linked to BIM and then the execution on the job site and what that means. And so what that means is we're producing more in a factory typesetting on these more sophisticated jobs and less in the field. And you can really see that on large scale mechanical projects which lead the way and our electrical contractors especially as they build up these data centers and the work they support in healthcare get better at it every day too. The other thing we did is we enhanced our position in markets that are more favorable for us to complete more of the value chain so like fire protection. So that was a build-out strategy that's been 12, 15 years in the making. We did through acquisition, we've done it through organic growth and we've done it through capital investment. Again, our folks and the leaders impede fabrication. Shambaugh & Son and S.A. Comunale are the best fire protection contractors in my mind and they had plenty of competition but they're really good at what they do and they are preferred technical choice. And, thinking about that fire protection model and why we liked it so much is labor is more flexible, it's a national union for most of the union. It's design-build product on a very specific trade, people just design to a code. We then design the system underlying in it and lends itself then well to prefabrication and it lends itself well to cruise that can dealt means and methods and apply it across multiple sites. And you never put away that they got great management, right? They really understand how to satisfy our customers and at the same time drive superior operational performance. Anything about the Mechanical Services that you go to more structural, right? We've done a lot in building services to restructure how we think about the business and what I mean by that is, if you go into building services our site-based business is a -- we have a very good business development, we have a very good execution team. We lead with self-perform and we lead with scope that makes sense for us. We're better at selecting our customers than we ever have been. People that demand technical excellence or demand consistent execution across many sites and it's really with our self-performed labor as we build that up from embryonic 2011, maybe 50, 70 guys to over 500 today of these operating engineers with some HVAC, some electrical skilled and that team has done a great job. And then you get to the Mechanical Services side, we spend a lot of time understanding mix and pricing and project management and sophistication where we actually brought as we move up the chain on these bigger energy efficiency project, it scales from our Mechanical Construction segment and some of them been into the Mechanical Services likewise, we've done the opposite and taken some of the small project skills and put them in our Mechanical Construction segment. And then finally, we're achieving these margins, right, Mark, in the phase of what would have been a less favorable mix in 2011. Industrial was our highest margin product from a lot of our time between 2008 and 2013, 2014. And we expect those margins to improve but we have done it in the other trades which are much bigger and we wouldn't have expected the mix up the way we did. Yes. And Sean, right now because of the mix of work and we're doing some bigger work. Where they're going to be, north of 5%. We're also worried about margin dollars, right, Mark? And we're going to drive the percentage up, Mark is a percentage guy, I'm a percentage guy and a dollar guy. We're sort of -- that's a Yin and Yan it happens in business, you go to do both. And we see pretty favorable mix. Now, one of the -- I think what's underlying your question is, if we get hit with a bad cycle, what happens? Since about 2008 when we had that recession, we've always had the mindset is our next highs have to be better than our last highs in a cycle, and our lows have to be better than the last lows. And so that's why I think when Mark says he's in the structural camp. We've done structural things to this business that we know of, and we could go through more of it, right? We talked about BIM fabricate, we talk about IT systems. We can talk about planning. We talk about how we -- how the segments have been flatten, and we can talk about all that stuff. But the key point is we're all laser-focused on having a cost structure that can compete in a tougher market. And that is something we have -- we collectively down through the subsidiary CEO level focus on every day. Yes. From your lips to God's ears, right, that inflation starts to moderate. Look, I back in the envelope, I think we think it's hard to do it because of scopes, kinds of equipment, equipment in our mix, equipment out of our mix, some of our bigger work, we don't actually purchase the underlying equipment so that's out. Labor's actually been reasonable. I think they're in it for the long game. Our collective bargaining agreements have been reasonable. They're much more focused on what goes into the benefit package. They're much more focused on actually improving the pipeline into the trades in a lot of these local unions, which is quite robust right now. I would actually say Mark 15%, 20%. Not something we haven't looked at, Sean. It's really hard to normalize period to period. But it would say, yes, 12% to 20% of that gains in revenue and in RPOs are probably inflation related. Well, the works for the most part is starting now. If you think about how work gets awarded in our space, if we had some delays because of equipment and we had some delays of awards because of equipment that's part of what you saw in the third quarter. When this customer provided equipment, they delayed the award. We knew we were getting it, but they delayed the award, as we talked about. Adam, we don't comment on 2023 right now. But look, we have record RPO levels, we're in the fourth quarter, we expect a good start to 2023. The next six months should be okay, right? Because we're in the fourth quarter turnaround season, we're going into the first quarter turnaround season. We have no reason to believe that those -- well, we're in the one, right? So we know that most of that schedule is getting executed. And we think most of the first quarter will get executed. But we're at record frac spreads, and we have incredible external pressure on these refiners to keep operating. We don't make those decisions. We plan for them. We are well-positioned to support our customers, and we also think some of our renewable projects will start to come online as we exit the year into the first quarter of 2023. I'll let Mark take that. Yes. I mean, we like what we did so far year-to-date. We wish we have done a little more. We see continued good opportunities. We see it in our Electrical segment. We see in our Mechanical Construction segment. We see in Building Services. Industrial is more organic growth. We have the capabilities to support our customers. And even on UK, we could see an interesting acquisition or two. The bar for us is fairly high, right? We have good organic growth opportunities. We still have capabilities and geographies we'd like to fill, and we have people that want to be owned by EMCOR. We have great success in people that are trying to move their life's work to us. That's a better scenario for us. We earn well in excess of our cost of capital, and we make very fair deals with the sellers. We don't -- we're not bargain hunters, and we're not going to be the people that are going to go that squeeze the absolute last dollar out of the transaction. It's just not how it works when someone wants to be part of our team going forward. We do a lot of small acquisitions you never hear about that build a branch or allow us to take a mechanical service contractor in the West from a $40 million in 2002 to $300 million today. And so we're very intentional about that M&A dollars. Do I think there is a $1 billion deal in our offing? No, I don't. I think that we will continue to operate well with the $40 million to $300 million acquisition, and I think we have plenty of opportunities there over a multi-year period. Yes, that would be around renewables and substations that support renewables. That would be located there. And it would also be on substations supporting manufacturing clients as they build out their facilities. Yes, that's mainly what that is. Yes. Yes, yes. Most of them will be complete by the end of the year. We have one more that will be sitting out there. Obviously, at the end of every reporting period, we take our best view on that job. So we think we know where we are. This is not hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of work that need to be completed. It's probably around $50 million to $60 million of work to get completed. This is work that for the most part, was taken between 2015 and 2017, like Mark said, under very different operating assumptions. It got delayed for some design issues initially, then some pandemic issues, then some supply chain issues. And it's work that we completed in the West Coast, and we will finish those jobs. We will seek our contractual entitlement and we will move on. It's not -- like I said, this isn't hundreds of millions of dollars of backlog or hundreds of millions of dollars of work. That work will be -- other than one job, will be complete mostly this year, and maybe a couple of things will dribble into the first quarter. I think most of its secular trends on what the business is doing right. The size we're at now, with their profitability now, we love warm weather. We've been -- we don't -- Not like it used to, because of the size. I think what really is driving the performance is really paying -- what we didn't talk about, right? Because if things are good, you don't have to whine, right? But we didn't talk about the fuel headwind that Building Services segment had it is not zero. I mean, Mark, $3 million to $5 million? Yes. I mean, $0.04, $0.05 a share of headwind coming out of fuel just in Building Services, and you probably double that across the business. Now as the year goes on, when we recouped it as our pricing caught up. We don't talk about all the planning we have to do on what we're supposed to be short-cycle projects that get pushed out and what that means for their workforce planning and how we're not absorbing. I would argue they're performing at these levels with less than optimal labor utilization on the project mix side. But offsetting that is unbelievable execution on the repair service side, which is really, really strong, which is clearly highly skilled labor and the utilization and the pricing around that, coupled with the best execution we've ever seen in our commercial site-based business. And also as we even start-up new customers, as we renew customers, and we're really -- and more importantly, we're delivering for our customers there. I mean, that's a business where you really have to work with the customer on the budgeting and year-over-year productivity and cost reductions in an inflationary environment and getting through that takes a lot of scale, and that team is executing. As well as the UK team, I would put those two together, operating in really, really difficult environments for our customers, and really delivering for them. Yes. I mean look, that's something -- this is a seasoned management team. And so we're always aware of planning for the inevitable slowdown, right? I do think if you go to the sectors I talked about on Page 13, I mean there's a real trench, right? And there may be blips along the way, but you can't get out of the way of what are really great macro trends. But people, oh, is a secular macro trends, you have to have planned and you have had to build the labor force to take advantage of those secular trends well before the secular trend happen. So there's really nothing that's happening right now that surprises us, except for maybe the speed of some of the dollars in energy transition. So we feel good about that. The second thing is, if you think about it from an underlying, what are some things that are really things we didn't have much to do with that are going to help those secular trends? There's been three or four pieces of legislation over the last couple of years that will help keep some of that demand solidified and also solidified on terms that are good for a highly skilled contractor that always pays prevailing wages. And so if you think about it, the first one was the CARES Act. Mark talked a little bit about that. That's going to drive underlying demand in the institutional market. That's the biggest part for us, schools, right, and other institutional buildings to do building upgrades. Now that was 2021. You thought it was all spent. No, it's not. Nothing almost got spent in 2021, it can't, right? You pass it, it takes a lot of plan. Then you get to 2022, Mark talked about that being some of the drivers for our small project work in the mix. Now you get to 2023, we think we'll see even more of that. Actually, I think that will be near the peak year for the execution of those projects. Then you move to the infrastructure, probably not that big of a deal for us overall with the mix of work we do. We'll get some effect, right? We do have some transportation capability to do lighting and driver information systems. Some airport upgrades will happen that we'll be part of, and we're doing that today. And some port upgrades will happen that we'll be part of it. But generally that's a civil infrastructure build, and we're not civil contractors. Then you move to the CHIPS Act. Look, those customers are strong and financially strong to begin with. What this does is put a base under that so that they know there's some long-term capital contribution. It also sets it up on terms that are good for contractors like us. Whether they be union or non-union, you're going to pay prevailing wages and you're going to do that work here in the U.S., right? Most of those sites were designed and developed and everything else before the Act, but the Act helped strengthen the implementation of those projects. And we're positioned in a lot of those markets. The last one is the IRA. What that helps with some of these energy transition and energy efficiency. And again, we will participate in that. So yes, there's going to be speed bumps along the way. But when you're in the businesses that we are, and really, I think that the number of people that can do what we do on some of these larger projects, there's plenty of them, there's competition. But you have to have the skill to get in the project early and do the technical planning. And then they have to believe that you have the prefab and BIM capability to do the design assist to move that project along and then you can invariably flex up and down through workforce planning and execution. I'm not sure, going forward, how dilutive the impact is of inflation, right? We have a margin. We have to make on our labor and our procurement of those materials. I think what your -- what has happened, right, is more of the supply chain disruption is more a problem for us than the inflation. Yes, we passed the inflation on. But we also look to seek to make our margin, right? It's not passed on without making a margin. What the real issue is the supply chain disruptions. Now part I think we believe, as a management team is we're now in a spot where things are getting delivered, right? So we waited, we waited, we waited. There was the disruption, which we foreshadowed way back in our second quarter 2021 call. We had some things priced differently. We're working through it, working through it. And now we're getting major equipment delivered. We're putting it on the site. We put that into our planning. Are we building things optimally the way we'd want to build them? Of course not. But we have figured out how to work around that. In some ways, you're almost treating the installation of some of the major subsystems, as you would on a replacement job. You're doing everything else first. I mean, because the availability of pipe and wire and more commodity-type materials has actually been pretty good, and the price has come down actually. So you put the bundle together, might it have a minor impact, Mark, to keep things tamped down. It's not -- it's not driving it. Anybody else, no? All right. Thank you all very much. Stay safe, and we won't be talking to you. So have a great Thanksgiving."

Tony? \nAnthony Guzzi: Yes. Thanks. Good morning to everybody, and thanks for your interest in EMCOR. My initial comments will focus on Pages 4 through 6 of the presentation. We had a strong second quarter at EMCOR with revenues of $2.7 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.99. We delivered overall quarterly revenue growth of 11.1%, with organic revenue growth of 9.7%. We had operating income margins of 5.1% which is especially strong when considering the headwinds we faced with supply chain issues.\n We generated quarterly operating cash flow of $77 million and exited the quarter with very strong remaining performance obligations or RPOs of $6.5 billion, which represent nearly 27% growth from the year ago period and 15% from year-end 2021.\n We remain committed to our capital allocation strategy, returning a record $458 million in cash to our shareholders through June 30, 2020, in a volatile operating environment. Our team has resilience and flexibility as we continue to drive successful results for our customers and our business.\n Our forward momentum this quarter was driven by these key factors. We are seeing strong demand for our specialty Contracting and Construction Services across a variety of sectors where we can differentiate ourselves, which is health care, water and waste, commercial and industrial/manufacturing. We also continue to see strong forward demand for our data center and high-tech manufacturing construction services.\n Our Construction segments reported a combined operating income margin of 6.9% in the quarter. Our Mechanical Construction segment operating income margins were a strong 7.2% and Electrical Construction segment operating income margins rebounded to a much improved 6.2% versus first quarter performance. Performance in both segments continues to be impacted by ongoing supply chain issues related to equipment lead times and deliveries. And most of these issues that impacted our margins were from projects we booked over 2 to 3 years ago prior to the emergence of inflationary and supply chain challenges. Every day, we are making improvements to our planning and [indiscernible] and workforce scheduling to better position us to navigate volatile supply chain environment, which remains as difficult as it was in the first quarter.\n Our [indiscernible] is now proving useful as we work with our suppliers to keep moving and obtain the most comprehensive delivery [indiscernible] possible.\n In the United States Building Services segment, we faced the ongoing supply chain issues as in the [indiscernible] segment with respect to our project work, where we have record RPOs, [indiscernible] projects and where the growths in RPOs is more than 20% on a year-over-year basis.\n Our results are being driven to a large extent, very strong growth for our HVAC repair service, our highest-margin product line in the U.S. Building Services segment. This strong repair service growth makes sense as we are not able to execute some equipment replacement work because of very extended lead times for the HVAC equipment. If our customers cannot replace agent and efficient equipment, they [indiscernible] fix it for them.\n We also performed very well in our commercial site-based business, which continues to provide stable performance through excellent execution and smart account selection.\n Industrial Services segment is performing about how we expected on a year-to-date basis. We execute turnaround services as anticipated and continue to see opportunities to improve operating margins. Demand is [indiscernible] but our customers are under considerable pressure to keep their facilities operating at what is extraordinarily high utilization.\n Our United Kingdom Building Services segment continues to deliver steady performance and continues to serve some of the most important and sophisticated customers and sectors in the U.K.\n Before I turn the [indiscernible] over to Mark, I just want to emphasize that following a record return of cash to shareholders. We left the second quarter with a strong balance sheet. This strong balance sheet serves an important catalyst to win work from some of our most sophisticated customers, executing large and complex projects. Record RPOs of $6.5 billion is a testament to not only our execution, but also our financial strength.\n With that, I will now turn the presentation over to Mark for a detailed discussion of our financial results. \nMark Pompa: Thank you, Tony, and good morning to everyone participating in the call today. For those accessing this presentation on webcast, now on Slide 7. As Tony indicated, over the next several slides, I will supplement Tony's opening commentary on EMCOR's second quarter performance as well as provide a brief update on our year-to-date results through [indiscernible]. All financial information referenced this morning is derived from our consolidated financial statements in both our earnings release announcement and Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this morning.\n So let's revisit and expand our review of EMCOR's second quarter performance. Consolidated revenues of $2.71 billion are up $269.7 million or 11.1% over quarter 2 2021. Our second quarter results include $33.7 million of revenues attributable to businesses acquired, pertaining to [indiscernible] such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in last year's second quarter. Acquisition revenues positively impacted our United States Construction segment within the second quarter.\n Before reviewing the operating results of our individual segments, I would like to highlight that our $2.71 billion of quarterly revenues represents a new all-time quarterly revenue record for the company despite the [indiscernible] in the United Kingdom Building Services segment revenues which was largely due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements.\n The specifics to each of our reportable segments are as follows: United States Electrical Construction segment revenues of $564.1 million increased $72 million or 14.6% from 2021's comparable quarter. Excluding incremental acquisition revenues, this segment's revenues grew organically [indiscernible] quarter-over-quarter. Increased project activity within the commercial market sector, inclusive of the telecommunication and high-tech submarket sectors as well as growth in each of the health care, manufacturing, water and wastewater market sectors were the primary drivers of the period-over-period improvement.\n Partially offsetting these increases was a decline in revenues from the institutional market sector due to the completion or substantial completion of certain projects performed in the corresponding 2021 period.\n United States Mechanical Construction segment revenues of $1.066 billion increased $97.7 million or 10.1% from quarter 2 2021. The Revenue growth during the quarter was derived strictly from organic activities within the majority of the market sectors we serve, the manufacturing, water and wastewater and institutional market sector is experiencing the most significant period-over-period increases.\n We also continue to see revenue growth within the commercial market sector, driven by demand from customers within the semiconductor and life sciences industries.\n Second, revenues for EMCOR's combined United States construction businesses of $1.63 billion increased $169.7 million or 11.6% from quarter 2 2021.\n United States Services quarterly revenues of $677.8 million increased $66 million or 10.8%. Revenue growth was generated within the segment's commercial site-based and Mechanical Services divisions. With respect to commercial site-based activity, [indiscernible] additions and scope or site expansion with existing customers were the drivers of the quarterly increase in revenues.\n Within Mechanical Services, we have seen a continuation of the trends that existed in quarter 1. Notably, we have experienced an increase in service repair and maintenance volumes partially as supply chain delays have resulted in the need to extend the useful lives of HVAC equipment in instances when new equipment is not readily available. In addition, there continues to be a high demand for building one in [indiscernible], with an emphasis on improving building efficiency, energy consumption and indoor air quality.\n Industrial Services segment revenues of $284.5 million increased $49.3 million or 21%. Revenue in the segment have grown in comparison for the comparable prior year period for each of the last 4 quarters as we are expecting some stabilization in demand for our downstream focused services. This has led to an increase in field services with some [indiscernible] spring turnarounds as well as greater maintenance and capital project activity.\n This growth is despite the headwinds within the upstream and midstream energy sectors, which is impacting certain of our service lines. We have also seen an increase in shop services revenue to new equipment, as well as pull-through repair projects resulting from ongoing turnarounds. With refinery utilization levels in excess of 90%, we remain hopeful that the last 6 months of 2022 will provide market condition that can perpetuate this segment's recent trend of improved results.\n United Kingdom Building Services revenues of $114.6 million decreased $15.3 million. This revenue contraction was predominantly attributable to unfavorable exchange movements of $12.5 million in the quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the growth in project activity within the segment was more than offset by a reduction in service contract revenues due to the loss of certain contracts not successfully obtained at rebid.\n Please turn to Slide 8. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $245.4 million represent 9.1% of increase of $2.4 million from quarter 2 2021. For incremental expenses attributable to companies acquired of $3.1 million, inclusive of intangible asset amortization, EMCOR's SG&A expenses for the quarter declined slightly on an organic basis. As a reminder, 2021 second quarter [indiscernible] a $4.1 million provision for credit loss within our U.S. Industrial Services segment related to a customer bankruptcy. Our credit loss activity in the current year second quarter is substantially less, contributing to the period-over-period organic SG&A decline.\n Despite adding personnel to support strong organic revenue growth and travel and entertainment expenses continuing to trend higher as business travel resumes a [indiscernible]. We have been successfully leverage our cost structure, resulting in a reduction in our SG&A margin. We can main disciplined with overhead investment and we'll seek efficiencies and economies of scale as we drive future revenue growth.\n Reported operating income for the quarter of $137.6 million favorably compares to $133.4 million operating income [indiscernible] second quarter. Quarter 2 operating margins of 5.1% is down [indiscernible] basis points from 2021 second quarter and is largely due to a less favorable revenue mix within our U.S. construction operations, which I will cover in my segment commentary.\n As a reminder, our second quarter 2021 consolidated operating margin of 5.5% represented a quarter 2 record. Specific quarterly operating performance by reporting segment is as follows: operating income of our U.S. Electrical Construction Services segment of $35.1 million decreased $7.9 million from the comparable 2021 period. Reported operation of 6.2% represents a reduction from the 8.7% in last year's second quarter. The decrease in both operating income and operating margin is due to a less favorable project mix within the commercial, institutional and transportation market sectors when compared to the prior year period.\n In addition, we did experience certain discrete project write-downs this quarter that reduced this segment's operating income by [indiscernible]. These losses negatively Electrical Construction quarter 2 operating margin by 140 basis points. Further, [indiscernible] from quarter 1, we continue to experience labor productivity and efficiency challenges due to supply chain difficulties resulting in equipment delivery delays, which has impacted project timelines. Although this segment continues to lag 2022 performance, we are reporting substantial sequential improvement in both margin and operating income dollars when compared to the first quarter of this year.\n Second, operating income of our U.S. Mechanical Construction segment of $76.9 million was essentially flat with the comparable 2021 period. Reported operating margin of 7.2% represents a 70 basis point reduction from the 7.9% earned a year ago. As referenced during the last 2 quarters, our Mechanical Construction segment has a larger number of active projects within the manufacturing and water and wastewater market sectors where we are either acting as a construction manager or general contractor in the [indiscernible], the percentage of our self-performed labor is less than a typical mechanical construction project, thereby resulting in our gross margin profile. This segment additionally experienced certain project write-downs during the quarter, which negatively impacted operating margin by 40 basis points.\n Consistent with our Electrical Construction quarterly performance, U.S. Mechanical Construction sequentially improved, both reported operating margin and operating income dollars from quarter 1 of this year. Operating [indiscernible] Building Services is $38.2 or 5.6% of revenues, which represents a $5.6 million increase in operating income and a [indiscernible] basis point improvement in operating margin.\n Operating performance within the segment's Mechanical Services division, both favorable project execution as well as the impact of certain price adjustments aimed at better aligning our billing rates with the increased costs we have experienced were the key drivers of this segment's increases in operating income and operating income margin.\n Our U.S. Industrial Services segment operating $6.5 million represents a $6.7 million improvement from the [indiscernible] operating loss reported in 2021 second quarter. This is our Industrial segment's third consecutive operating profit since reporting periods prior to the pandemic, albeit at operating margin remained lower than historical levels as we continue to battle a competitive pricing environment and higher cost inflationary headwinds. On a positive note, anticipated projects are either occurring or scheduled [indiscernible] during the remainder of 2022, in line with our initial planning expectations.\n U.K. Building Services operating income of $6.4 million or 5.6% of revenues represents a slight decrease from the quarter of 2021 due to the unfavorable exchange rates for the pound sterling versus the United States dollar. We continue to experience strong project demand within this segment as our customer base advance capital investment programs, which is contributing to the 20 basis points of operating margin expansion per year.\n We are now on Slide 9. Additional financial items of significance for the quarter [indiscernible] in the previous slides are as follows: quarter 2 gross profit of $383 million is higher than the comparable 2021 by $6.7 million or just under 2%, however, gross margin of 14.1% is lower than last year's second quarter due to the reasons covered during my operating expense commentary, including project mix, supply chain difficulties and construction project write-downs.\n Incremental revenues helped us achieve a new second quarter gross profit record, but prevailing macroeconomic headwinds are hindering our ability to maximize profit conversion. Diluted earnings per common share in the second quarter of 2022 is $1.99 as compared to $1.78 per diluted share for the prior year period. This second quarter EPS performance represents quarterly earnings per share record due to a combination of greater net income and a reduction in our weighted average shares [indiscernible] given the new share activity.\n Please turn to Slide 10. With the quarterly commentary complete, I will touch on the highlights with respect to EMCOR's results for the first 6 months of 2022. Revenues of $5.3 billion represent an increase of $558 million or 11.8% [indiscernible] was generated organically. Operating income of $237.6 million or 4.5% of revenues represents a 5.1% reduction from the results for the first 6 months of 2021 as our improved second quarter 2022 performance was not enough to offset slow start in quarter 1. With our increased share repurchase activity and corresponding reduction in shares outstanding, today, diluted earnings per share of $3.36 equips is that of the prior year to $3.32.\n Turning to Slide 11. Headed by the strength of our balance sheet, EMCOR remains a vision to invest in our business, return capital to shareholders and against our strategic objectives. Our cash on hand has declined from year-end 2021 levels as we have allocated $454.3 million towards the repurchase of our common stock during the first months of calendar 2022. Approximately $272.5 million of this amount was [indiscernible] during the second quarter as equity market volatility continued due to inflationary and interest rate [indiscernible].\n The midpoint of this year then doubled our previous high for share repurchases, [indiscernible] cash to shareholders our quarterly dividend, which amounted to $13.6 million during the year-to-date period has been [indiscernible] when evaluating the working capital investment necessary to sustain our strong organic revenue growth as well as our future opportunities in addition to our [indiscernible] for both capital and strategic investments. In addition to our share repurchase and dividend activity, additional factors for the period-over-period decline in our reported cash balance include $26.6 million in payments for acquisitions and $27.7 million in capital expenditures.\n In addition to cash, other movements in our balance sheet of note are as follows: Working capital has decreased by nearly $307 million. The decrease in cash just referenced coupled with an increase in our net contract liability position was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable given the revenue growth during the period. Goodwill has increased marginally since December of last year, given the acquisitions completed by us thus far in 2022. Net identifiable intangible assets have decreased by approximately $12 million during 2022 as amortization expense has more than offset the additional intangible assets recognized in connection with our year-to-date acquisition activity.\n Total debt, exclusive of operating liabilities remains fairly consistent with that as of December, and EMCOR's debt to capitalization ratio has increased from 10.4% at year-end 2021 to 11.8% at June 30, 2022, given the reduction in our shareholders' equity resulting from our share repurchase activity during the 6 months.\n To pick up from both Tony and my earlier comments, EMCOR remains committed to our capital allocation strategy, [indiscernible] by both our share repurchase activity to date as well as today's announcement that our Board of Directors has approved an additional $500 million authorization under our share repurchase program, an increase in dividend of approximately 15%.\n With my portion of this morning's slide presentation is complete, I will now return the call back to Tony. Tony? \nAnthony Guzzi: Thanks, Mark. And I'm going to be on Page 12, remaining performance obligations by segment and market sector. Much like the last quarter, the second quarter was another strong project bookings quarter for the company. We continue to experience core demand across all our segments and many of our market sectors. Total company RPOs at the end of the second quarter was $6.4 million, [indiscernible] or [indiscernible] over June 30, 2021, total of $5.1 billion. Measuring from the end of 2021, RPO [indiscernible] $862 million thus far this year or a strong 15.4%. Additionally, second quarter project bookings were likely strong by an increase of RPOs of $508 million from this year's first quarter. Almost all of the RPO increase this quarter was organic.\n Growth was broad-based, with each of the 5 segments growing RPO totals from both the year ago and 2021 periods. We are positioned in active nonresidential market sectors and continue to see velocity in our business.\n The 1-2 punch we highlighted in our first quarter call continued this quarter, where we experienced both strong revenue growth and total RPO growth. While some RPO growth thus far could be attributable costs due to outside factors, we continue to see an active bidding environment despite current supply disruptions and inflation challenges. Together, our domestic construction segments experienced strong project growth year-over-year, RPOs increasing over $1 billion or 25% from June 2021. The Mechanical Construction segments or RPOs increased by [indiscernible] or 23% while the Electrical Construction segment saw an increase of $350 million or nearly 30%. Since September '21, our domestic [indiscernible] segment RPOs have increased over $600 million.\n U.S. Building Services RPO levels increased $328 million or 44% from the year ago quarter and now is over $1 billion in quality projects and service [indiscernible]. As I mentioned earlier, extended lead times for HVAC equipment, combined with a continued push for energy efficiency and improving building wellness is resulting in our customers asking us to retrofit and repair their equipment. Additionally, strained equipment availability is driving our repair service, which is [indiscernible] grow margin work that we do at EMCOR. \n Moving to the right side of the page, we show RPOs broken down by market segment. Continuing to trend, RPO growth was based in the second quarter across market sectors with RPOs increasing almost $1.1 billion. $700 million of which was booked in the first half of 2022. Also, moving to this $1.1 billion increase for projects in the hyperscale data center, high-tech semiconductor arena as well as projects within [indiscernible] sciences and the pharma businesses. All of this shows the diversity and strength of EMCOR's end markets.\n Finishing our sector RPO growth year-over-year, health care RPOs are up 10%, institutional [indiscernible] and short-duration projects, which includes much of the HVAC retrofit project work are up 26%. Partially offsetting this was a reduction in transportation RPOs and as well as minor decreases in water and wastewater and industrial and manufacturing. From both a business segment and market perspective, I continue to like the balance and breadth of our RPOs.\n We get to go to my -- one of my favorite slides, which is Page 13. And I'd like you to turn there now, and we can talk about why we remain optimistic about EMCOR for the future. On this page, you see well positioned in growing nonresidential market interest. And I'm going to talk about each of these in turn. Data centers and semiconductor fabrication. And we have big news today in the semiconductor front and EMCOR will benefit from that because we are working with all those customers that will benefit. We'll see strong electrical, mechanical and fire protection demand across all those opportunities in semiconductors. And EMCOR is positioned well in Arizona, specifically mechanically. We are positioned well across the entire geography where there'll be some projects done with fire protection and capability in Arizona and burgeoning [indiscernible] Ohio on the [indiscernible] sector front.\n Data centers, it's tried to say, I believe there are none better at mechanical and electrical construction within data centers than our own companies. We have leading positions in some core geographical markets, and we can build from an enterprise level [indiscernible] to a high-tail data center using 50 megawatts hour. Our folks are terrific. And those teams in Portland and Salt Lake, Dine D.C., Gibson, Forest. These people are except data center builders on the electrical side. On the mechanical side, Bachelor & Kimball, Pool and Kent, F&G, our exceptional data center builders. They know their work. We're trusted by both our general contract customers and our owner customers. They come to us because we have great technical skill and they know that we have the financial strength to complete and finish those projects.\n In the industrial and manufacturing side, we are very well positioned. Mark talked about some of the ability to bring together a prime project across a number of trades, especially for plant relocations. We also are market leaders in food fabrication. If you go to that trade business, there are none better than Southern industrial contractors down in the Southeast. And they also move up into the lower Midwest. And we not only help people fix their existing facilities. We help them upgrade where they are [indiscernible] in moving and relocating equipment and building and manufacturing capacity.\n Our food processing expertise is [indiscernible] through our Shambaugh & Son. And we also, across a fleet of things are -- we can do as much as electrical charging station work [indiscernible], we need to be at the higher end of that, and we do that exceptionally well.\n Health care, that's always been a core market for EMCOR. We were integral and a lot of the things that had to happen within the pandemic to build extra capacity within the ecosystem. And we are now part of the retrofit and expansion of not only hospital systems, but medical buildings and outpatient surgery centers.\n Water and wastewater our market really for that for the most part. We do electrical work at different parts around the country. The bigger part of that work is mechanical. The team down at pool and Ken South and to some extent, Harry Pepper are very good at that work. And the [indiscernible] team has had a leading position in both the East and West Florida and helping with the population in the consent decrees that have happened there.\n Mechanical Services, if we are leading, we are within the top 3 of people that can provide mechanical services solutions. And those solutions that we provide not only provide efficiency, they provide building and resiliency, and they also now, with the pandemic, wellness has even become more important. The building efficiency is one of the major ways that you can drive carbon reduction. [indiscernible] happening across our footprint, right? Because as you increase the building wellness and increase outside air coming in, you have to even seek more efficiency within the building because outside actually at the detriment of building efficiency. It's a wonderful [indiscernible] for our people to meet our customers and for us to meet our carbon reduction goals that people -- that are client set. And we do that also through control solutions.\n Fire protection, there are none better then the teams of Shambaugh & Son and [indiscernible] to bring a solutions to some of the most complex service and construction jobs. And I'd be remiss not to say [indiscernible] also are going to be big participants across the portfolio of projects, not only renewables, but carbon reduction and capture project. We like our position that work, for the most part, is happening in segment. A lot of it's been delayed. And in our Industrial segment, where [indiscernible] will participate in solar projects, and they also help within wind projects on the transmission side as does Wasatch out in the Intermountain area.\n [indiscernible] participate a lot of robust market go up and down a little bit. But the general trend of these markets that I just went through are up into the right -- we spent a lot of time putting the assets in place, and we've got some of the best teams in the market executing against these opportunities.\n I'm going to go to Page 14 and 15 now. and I'm going to close off this discussion, and we'll take your questions. Entering this year, we knew that we would face some margin challenges. We were all the way back in February 2021, talking about supply chain with our year-end '21 call. And we also knew that because of our product and project mix, and you couple that with what we thought was happening with supply chain and COVID disruptions. I think our teams have done a great job in [indiscernible] these challenges in this operating environment. and we are pleased with our current position. We talked about demand for our services remain strong across most of our most important market sectors and in all of our reporting segments.\n As a result, we're going to update our guidance range. We now believe that we will achieve $7.30 to $7.80 in earnings per diluted share, and we expect at least $10.8 billion in revenue. Where we end up in that range, and I always sort of provide a road map of what could give you the ups or down. Where we end up in that range will depend not only on our execution, but also equipment and material [indiscernible]. We anticipate that we will continue to experience supply chain challenges. We do expect to convert operating income margins of 5% for the remainder of 2022, similar to what we achieved in the first half of the year. If we approve from margins due to better supply chain execution and improved productivity, we could see even stronger results in the back half of the year.\n How do you get there? And what are the backers that drive that? We expect to continue to achieve favorable SG&A leverage as compared to 2021. We expect to see strong project demand across key market sectors like industrial, manufacturing, health care and commercial, which includes both data center and semiconductor projects. We expect demand to be strong across a range of project sizes and scopes. We believe we'll continue to see very strong HVAC repair service demand as trends we observed this quarter continue through the third quarter. The summer heat we are seeing helps us.\n [indiscernible] a more normalized fall turnaround season in our Industrial Services segment with our oil and gas customers and our refining and petrochemical customers. We should start executing some renewable energy projects that are delayed because of material availability.\n While we are pleased with our current trajectory and optimistic about the balance of the year, we are also aware that we will continue to face headwinds in the near term. COVID is still here. And while we believe we have the systems in place to navigate and mitigate its challenges and keep our workforce safe, we expect that some project sites will be disrupted. Further supply chain issues exist with availability, delivery and pricing all [indiscernible] challenges. This will continue in my estimation through the balance of 2022 into 2023.\n Finally, with respect to challenges, we cannot ignore certain [indiscernible] in our macro environment. Rising interest rates, [indiscernible] lending and energy scarcity, exacerated by the conflict in Ukraine and other policy matters will cause issues. To date, as evidenced by our strong growth in RPOs, we believe we have the resilient market to operate in. However, when the leaders of major financial institutions cost projected market conditions, we [indiscernible] and we realize that it will likely [indiscernible]. We believe the outlook is strong despite all that, as evidenced by our year-to-date performance and our record RPOs of $6.5 billion.\n Our confidence in our business is reflected capital allocation strategy as we have returned a record amount of cash to shareholders, up $468 million through June 30, 2022. We announced an increase in our dividend by approximately 15% or $0.08 per share per annum, and our Board has provided, as Mark talked to our announcement today, an additional $500 million in authorization for share repurchases. We will continue to take a balanced approach to cash management, considering all the implications for maintaining and deploying funds, including maintaining cash and a strong balance sheet for our sureties, our investment in our organic growth, which has been quite strong, our acquisitions and our customer expectations for our financial strength. This approach to capital allocation has historically served us well. especially in periods of economic uncertainty. We [indiscernible] support our organic growth, and we have a decent pipeline of acquisitions to invest in across our segments.\n As always, I'd like to thank you for your interest in EMCOR. And I would like to especially thank all the members of our EMCOR team for their continued dedication, hard work and execution for our customers. And with that, I will ask Andrea to open the floor for your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]\n And our first question will come from Sean Eastman of KeyBanc Capital Markets. \nSean Eastman: Hi, Tim. [indiscernible] update here. Great update. First one, kind of more of a clarification question. So you mentioned how you really like the diversity in RPOs. But of course, per the disclosures, it shows over 45% of the mix is commercial. None of the end markets we're talking about are what I would sort of think of as commercial and that piece is rapidly growing and is a lot bigger than it was in, say, 2007, 2008. So can we just get some clarity on what that piece really is? \nAnthony Guzzi: It's growing, and I think we pointed it out in the commentary. What's driving that growth is -- you have to go back historically why it ended up there, right? Many, many years ago, it wasn't a major part of our business, and it was light manufacturing [indiscernible] enterprise data systems. Now, it's a bigger part of the business, but it's now data centers is driving the growth, high-tech manufacturing in general and more of what we were doing just build-out work, but now we're doing bigger work, life sciences, pharma and other types of that kind of manufacturing. And we still have pretty strong demand driving that growth, as we talked about in building services, there is all commercial for the most part. And that demand drives along HVAC retrofit projects, and most of those are in typical commercial.\n But Sean, you're pointing out something, it's growing as a bigger business. It's what's driving that commercial backlog increase, and that's why we took the time in our RPO section to talk about that. Mark? \nMark Pompa: Yes. I mean just to reamplify what Tony just said. For -- not to go for the reasons again, that Tony just mentioned, but included in our commercial RPO disclosure or all those things that Tony just highlighted as major growth areas and have been major contributors to our profitability over the last several years, we're reticent to change how we're categorizing that at a midpoint in a year, but it's something that we need to evaluate internally as we go forward to provide the analytical community, I guess, more written transparency than transparency we're already providing forward with regards to what those actually represent. \nSean Eastman: Okay. I think that's really important. So I appreciate that. And then on the margins, also just to clarify, I think, Tony, I think you said you guys have built in a 5% operating margin for the second half. I'm kind of struggling to get to the midpoint of the guidance with that number. So maybe, I'm -- maybe I heard that wrong.\n And also just broadly in terms of thinking about the progression of margins, we saw this really nice sequential improvement from 1Q to 2Q. Maybe talk about that bridge and I would have thought that into the second half, there would have been a lot of opportunity to continue to improve just in terms of some of the new construction work getting to later stages, driving a tailwind even if we're assuming the supply chain remains sort of [indiscernible]. \nAnthony Guzzi: Yes. So I'm going to kick this to Mark in a minute. But broadly, I said of around and 10 or 20 basis points, your right can move that. But Sean, the -- most of our caution of saying that number is around the macro environment and supply chain. It's hard for me today to tell you that the supply chain is all fixed and it's clear selling. Lead times are terrible. OEMs are routinely missing those terrible lead times. And that has implications for us. And so for us, to sort of sit here and not caution that would be irresponsible, I think.\n And then secondarily, we have work that's now going to be starting that's favorable to our mix. that should be further along than it is. And we're not exactly sure. A month means a lot when you start up a large project on equipment deliveries. And most of those larger projects, we're in concert with our customers ordering that equipment. They're actually buying it ahead of time. And we will start up when that equipment is there and that could be delayed. It can start 2 weeks from now, they can start 4 weeks from now, it can start 6 weeks from now. And Mark, I think that's where our caution is. \nMark Pompa: Yes. And obviously, Tony is around 5% as it is indicated. Can mean something in the low 5% range. So clearly, as you did the math, I'm sure you came out with operating margins of 5.2% or 5.3% in the back half of the year. So clearly, no worse than they were in the second quarter and significantly higher than they were in quarter 1 and at the 6-month point on a cumulative basis. So the variable there, once again, is the revenue number. So of that $10.8 billion of guided revenues ends up creeping up. It's quite possible we get at the same point at a 5% or 5.1% margin level for the last 6 months. \nSean Eastman: Okay. Good stuff, guys. All really helpful. I'll turn it over there. \nOperator: The next question comes from Adam Thalhimer of Thompson Davis. \nAdam Thalhimer: Congrats on the strong quarter and a well-timed buyback. \nAnthony Guzzi: Thanks, Adam. \nAdam Thalhimer: I'm going to talk about RPOs. Are they -- because they're so strong, are they at a level where, Tony, they're starting to give you some confidence in 2023? \nAnthony Guzzi: We don't give forward-looking guidance. But the reality is I go back to longer-term trends. And I go back to Page 13 in our presentation and talk about those sectors and most of them will be up into the right. Do I specifically know what will happen in 3 of the small project work? No, I don't. Do I know on what new awards -- No, I don't. But clearly, our average project length is somewhere 9 to 12 months. Some of these are longer term. And we'll see when they start up and then they finish. Again, we don't give forward guidance into '23. \nAdam Thalhimer: And then can we talk a little bit more about the electrical write-downs and those specific projects? Is there any risk to those in the back half? Or does that margin hit that you took in Q1 and Q2 just slip and go away for the back half? \nAnthony Guzzi: I mean in our business, we're always cautious to say write-downs go away. We've had a hell of a run without any significant losses. But our folks are working in unprecedented times, especially with respect to supply chain. And most of the write-downs we had in the first half of the year were on projects we took prior to the supply chain and inflation cycle. But that being said, there's a lot of moving pieces. So we actually -- I would just refer you back to the previous question on the 5 -- around 5% margin. we don't see anything or absolutely we would have taken it, right? That's how this business works. But we don't expect it, we would have taken it. And our electrical business has a good mix of work. And a lot of that margin progression to be dependent on our ability to start some of that favorable mix work will all be related to supply chain. \nMark Pompa: Adam, I'm going to just interject quickly. So Tony's point, obviously, to the extent that we've identified, the necessity to take a write-down. We've taken 100% of it in the second quarter, but we can't defer to later periods as I'm sure everyone in the call well knows. The only additional thing I'll add to Tony's commentary is that these projects are still active projects, so they create a little bit of margin headwind in that segment because we're going to be recognizing profit on the remaining revenues at a margin profile lower than what the segment traditionally [indiscernible]. That's the negative aspect of it. The fast fact is with regard to the projects that were written down, both in electric production and mechanical construction. They're all over -- they're well over 50% complete, some of them are even closer to 100% complete. So they are clearly not going to be the preponderance of revenues that are recognized in these segments as we work through the last 6 months of 2022. \nAdam Thalhimer: I almost led with that, too, because it's been 8 years since -- I think 2014 was the last time we talked about a problem project. So -- alternative. \nAnthony Guzzi: Adam, I mean, in all fairness, right, these aren't big giant project write-downs. This is more -- like Mark said, we're getting to the end of the project. Two of them were specifically stopped and started not only through the pandemic, but because of the supply chain. That's never good for a contractor, right? As you reassemble the team and get going again.\n And look, what we're known for EMCOR is we will finish the work. But then what we're also known for is not reflected in these write-downs, is our ability to go win what we think will have partial entitlement. Because customer hasn't made an offer back the other way, we're putting together the case, our guys are pretty [indiscernible], and we'll see what happens. But I wouldn't term these on the same magnitude as what we had 8 years ago on a specific job.\n I mean, these are -- in some ways, what happens in business when you get to a period of a very choppy environment where you have either on a disruption in the job site. One of them specifically [indiscernible] carry on -- further carry on from the first quarter, we thought we had it all, but one of them specifically was workforce-related, right? And it was related to our ability to get the right workforce on and at COVID disruption, we're working more over time. We finished the job. We have a great reputation. Life goes on.\n And I will tie that back to the earlier point. One of the reasons that we win this big work, this complex technical work is, hey, we got the best people in the field to execute this work. And we can assemble and put on fill the best people. And also, people know that we are thoughtful in [indiscernible] our balance sheet. So the work will get done and that we understand that we manage this business through cycles. And look, I think we're -- with the RPOs we have lined up, we feel pretty good about managing through this cycle. But again, we will see, right? I mean there was a negative GDP growth print today. I don't know what that means for our business. I just feel really good about where we are on Page 12 and 13 right now, which are RPOs and markets we have to work in. \nAdam Thalhimer: I agree. Great color. \nOperator: The next question comes from Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson. \nBrent Thielman: Tony, on the data center work, it seems like it's keeping you really active. We hear some rumblings out there that things might pull back in that market vertical. I mean, any the commentary in terms of what you're seeing out there in that market would be great. \nAnthony Guzzi: We don't see that. Could there be a short-term disruption? We don't see that. But anything we study, anything we talk to these major builders, we don't see a pullback. I think anything you're hearing around pullback is their frustration around the supply chain. I mean just for amplification on that. All these data centers, for the most part, are backed up by either natural gas generators or diesel generators. That's now up to 52 weeks. So as they try to think through how they're going to sequence these data center to come on, they have to take that in their planning.\n The [indiscernible] come in, these are 50-megawatt facilities. There's a substation build outside almost every one of them a substation two for one. Just to put in perspective, what 50 megawatts is, 50 megawatts of power about 1,500 to 2,000 [indiscernible]. Let us put this in perspective, what's happening here. Which gear to do that is 42 weeks right now. So [indiscernible], I think that people are feeling is, can we get the supply chain to make delivery?\n And then you get to the UPS system. It can take anywhere a square footage-wise, imagine a commercial 2 floors of a typical commercial office building, 60,000 square feet. That's the battery room to run that data center somewhere between 1 minute and 1.5 minutes until the generator kicks on. So these are the kind of systems that are more difficult to acquire right now. And I think that's what's causing -- and that's what caused the delay in our electrical business. So what's good news for us is those deliveries are going to start coming. We had pretty good performance without that in our mix. And then as we get through the back half of the year and into next year, that should be a favorable mix for us. \nBrent Thielman: Okay. Really helpful, Tony. Appreciate that. \n And then the -- I mean, it sounds like on the building services side, sort of the delays in getting big equipment, maybe some seasonal factors? Or it sounds like you guys think that's going to drive a pretty -- maybe unusually stronger second half for that segment. Is that a fair characterization just maybe everything you're seeing out there? \nAnthony Guzzi: It should, coupled with repair service demand. Mike [indiscernible] team right now sleep with one eye open and equipment deliveries. Not 100% sure that all of these manufacturers are going to meet their commitments. Me, look, I'll be blunt. I was in this game 18, 20 years ago. They are all terrible at deliveries right now. They are not performing and they are communicating terribly. I am very fortunate to work with the team that stay on top of this every day and are very good and understanding the language back from those OEMs with respect to their equipment deliveries and the fulfillment of those deliveries.\n We got the best team in the business, interpreting those results. But all 4 of them are terrible right now. \nBrent Thielman: Okay. Appreciate it, Tony. Thank you. \nOperator: Next question from Noelle Dilts of Stifel. \nNoelle Dilts: Congrats on the quarter. So maybe in a little bit on how you're thinking about M&A with the share repurchase announcement you discussed [indiscernible] in terms of priorities, what you're seeing in the market, how you're [indiscernible] about the potential for M&A? \nAnthony Guzzi: In general, nothing [indiscernible] in our philosophy. We've been balanced capital allocators for a while here at EMCOR. And I think in any given situation, you tell us Tony invest like crazy in organic growth when you have. And quite frankly, we have. We spent a little more on capital. Mark talked about the growth in AR. One of the big considerations we think about on a large project is what is cash flow characteristics of that project. And we know that sometimes an investment somewhere in the middle of the project. And one of the reasons we win some of those large projects. I mean, first is always technical capability, but also people look at it and said, you guys run a contract or the way you should run a contractor.\n And that's for the conservative balance sheet that we can figure it done. The second thing is we're very conscious with our authorities and talk about the relationship with them. We have great relationships with leading surety companies, and they appreciate how we run that and keep that balance sheet. Mark has done this for a long period of time with them to the point where the trust-based relationship we have there allows our people with confidence to go out and look at jobs and not worry about surety.\n And Mark, I think we have about $1.5 billion of that out there right now? \nMark Pompa: A little bit more. \nAnthony Guzzi: And alongside Surety Credit says the conversations we have with these large projects people, whether they be in hyperscale data centers, semiconductor work, health care facilities, where they'll work with our people, our General Counsel, and they'll say -- and us and say, we get it, but can we put a corporate care around that. And that all ties back to that thoughtfulness that we have around capital allocation and a strong balance sheet. So organic growth would always come first.\n And then I think after that, then we have the dividend which we think is a commitment over time. And we just increased it, and we feel good about that. And then we balance the capital allocation between share repurchases and acquisitions. The reality is, we've been fairly returning cash to shareholders since 2017, '18, especially, I think $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion has now been returned to shareholders through share repurchases. I give our CFO a ton of credit for how he thinks through that with his team and how they execute it.\n And then we clearly were exiting the year last year with a big cash position. Now, we built that big cash position because we're one of the best cash generators in the business over time from continuing from our operations. But we also had a dislocation, right, going from '19 to '20 with the pandemic. And in this business, the revenue shrunk and we threw up a lot of -- we knew we had this onetime mark [indiscernible] of excess cash. What was either going to get put to work [indiscernible] positions were going to get put to work with buyback. And then when we saw the dislocation, I would not just say in our stock, but in the market through the first 6 months of the year, we thought it was a comp on us to step in and repurchase shares because reality is versus any [indiscernible] acquisition we could have made for EMCOR, the best company we could buy at that multiple was EMCOR in the first 6 months of this year.\n So think about all this, we think about it over time. And all in [indiscernible] we've been acquirers a good place order somewhere between $150 million and $300 million a year. And the best deals that happen with us are people that are selling their life's work going to be part of the future.\n And recently, we did Quibi Holdings. Dennis Quibi and Buck Ross out there in Ohio, terrific company, great reputation. We feel really good about our future together. Several years ago, the team down in Atlanta and B&K that have a great presence in the Southeast and are probably some of the best leading edge people in BIM and prefabrication in the industry. And we worked together. They taught us a lot. We've taught them a lot. It's been a great group of people to have on our team. And then the whole fire protection build-out, going all the way back to Comunale and the organic at Shambaugh and Comunale, coupled with acquisitions, to build out that portfolio around the Shambaugh platform. \n And then the fabrication shops, investments we made on top of that, not only in Akron, Ohio, with Comunale but Fort Wayne, Indiana, and in Alabama, right by one of the big pipe producers [indiscernible] in Arizona. These are all thoughtful expansions of capacity to allow us to serve our customers after an acquisition strategy that helped us gain access to not only new capabilities in that market, but also geographic presence.\n And then you go to mechanical services where we -- within a geography, maybe buy a platform and then build it out much like we've done in Florida and in California. The Mesa team -- I mean, it's a remarkable story over a long period of time of the application of capital, acquisition capital and organic capital to go from a small, pretty good capability, Orange County-focused HVAC contractor with Bob Lake and Charlie Fletcher and the team out there to a -- I would say, the leading controls and HVAC service company across basically, 4 states in the West. And [indiscernible] a terrific job, and it's pushing on $200-plus million now. And that's been mostly organic, but it's been the application of capital to buy small contractors in the market and geographically fit it out.\n And we see those opportunities in front of us. And I think you know me, we always have said deals happen when they happen. We're always in the market. And we haven't been that successful over the last 4 years, 5 years, in competition with private equity on [indiscernible]. Part of that is our choice. I've never been a [indiscernible]. We got good visibility down through the organization on buying somebody else's consolidation or roll up -- they're roll ups. We're not -- we are operators. And I've never been a big fan of that unless we can really get down in the organization to understand who's running the local operations. And so we've sort of stayed away from it.\n And look, at the end of the day, we're going to buy what we're good at. We are good at trade contracting. We are a service and we are with highly technical people, and we are very -- and that's really the theme that unites all those segments. And we are very good at taking something that's very -- that's well run, helping us make it a little better run and then growing it once we buy it.\n So nothing's really changed, and I think we'll just keep executing the way we've been executing. \nNoelle Dilts: Thank you. \nAnthony Guzzi: Yes. Again, I spent a little time on that because it's always important to reiterate, which made us really good over a long period of time. We don't react to FADs and we just continue to execute. And I think that's the nature of the work we do.\n Anybody else, operator? \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tony Guzzi for any closing remarks. \nAnthony Guzzi: Yes. So I'm just going to finish the way I started. I'd like to thank all the folks that continue to support us and have listened to and supported our growth story over a long period of time. And I would really like to thank our segment and field leadership and our corporate staff. It's been -- really, great execution over a long period of time. And these last 3 years, they've been tough, right? But [indiscernible] to be big excuse makers, and we're going to continue that.\n And I think what's made us successful is we think through everything carefully, and we very rarely go off that track. And with that, we run by a set of values of mission first people always and our people love to execute for their customers and take care of their people, and we'll continue to do that.\n We'll talk to you in the third quarter. Be careful in the heat, and if you have it, you can't get your air conditioner fixed, look for your local [indiscernible] on our website. And with that, I'll let you go. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Anthony Guzzi",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks. Good morning to everybody, and thanks for your interest in EMCOR. My initial comments will focus on Pages 4 through 6 of the presentation. We had a strong second quarter at EMCOR with revenues of $2.7 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.99. We delivered overall quarterly revenue growth of 11.1%, with organic revenue growth of 9.7%. We had operating income margins of 5.1% which is especially strong when considering the headwinds we faced with supply chain issues.\n We generated quarterly operating cash flow of $77 million and exited the quarter with very strong remaining performance obligations or RPOs of $6.5 billion, which represent nearly 27% growth from the year ago period and 15% from year-end 2021.\n We remain committed to our capital allocation strategy, returning a record $458 million in cash to our shareholders through June 30, 2020, in a volatile operating environment. Our team has resilience and flexibility as we continue to drive successful results for our customers and our business.\n Our forward momentum this quarter was driven by these key factors. We are seeing strong demand for our specialty Contracting and Construction Services across a variety of sectors where we can differentiate ourselves, which is health care, water and waste, commercial and industrial/manufacturing. We also continue to see strong forward demand for our data center and high-tech manufacturing construction services.\n Our Construction segments reported a combined operating income margin of 6.9% in the quarter. Our Mechanical Construction segment operating income margins were a strong 7.2% and Electrical Construction segment operating income margins rebounded to a much improved 6.2% versus first quarter performance. Performance in both segments continues to be impacted by ongoing supply chain issues related to equipment lead times and deliveries. And most of these issues that impacted our margins were from projects we booked over 2 to 3 years ago prior to the emergence of inflationary and supply chain challenges. Every day, we are making improvements to our planning and [indiscernible] and workforce scheduling to better position us to navigate volatile supply chain environment, which remains as difficult as it was in the first quarter.\n Our [indiscernible] is now proving useful as we work with our suppliers to keep moving and obtain the most comprehensive delivery [indiscernible] possible.\n In the United States Building Services segment, we faced the ongoing supply chain issues as in the [indiscernible] segment with respect to our project work, where we have record RPOs, [indiscernible] projects and where the growths in RPOs is more than 20% on a year-over-year basis.\n Our results are being driven to a large extent, very strong growth for our HVAC repair service, our highest-margin product line in the U.S. Building Services segment. This strong repair service growth makes sense as we are not able to execute some equipment replacement work because of very extended lead times for the HVAC equipment. If our customers cannot replace agent and efficient equipment, they [indiscernible] fix it for them.\n We also performed very well in our commercial site-based business, which continues to provide stable performance through excellent execution and smart account selection.\n Industrial Services segment is performing about how we expected on a year-to-date basis. We execute turnaround services as anticipated and continue to see opportunities to improve operating margins. Demand is [indiscernible] but our customers are under considerable pressure to keep their facilities operating at what is extraordinarily high utilization.\n Our United Kingdom Building Services segment continues to deliver steady performance and continues to serve some of the most important and sophisticated customers and sectors in the U.K.\n Before I turn the [indiscernible] over to Mark, I just want to emphasize that following a record return of cash to shareholders. We left the second quarter with a strong balance sheet. This strong balance sheet serves an important catalyst to win work from some of our most sophisticated customers, executing large and complex projects. Record RPOs of $6.5 billion is a testament to not only our execution, but also our financial strength.\n With that, I will now turn the presentation over to Mark for a detailed discussion of our financial results. Thanks, Mark. And I'm going to be on Page 12, remaining performance obligations by segment and market sector. Much like the last quarter, the second quarter was another strong project bookings quarter for the company. We continue to experience core demand across all our segments and many of our market sectors. Total company RPOs at the end of the second quarter was $6.4 million, [indiscernible] or [indiscernible] over June 30, 2021, total of $5.1 billion. Measuring from the end of 2021, RPO [indiscernible] $862 million thus far this year or a strong 15.4%. Additionally, second quarter project bookings were likely strong by an increase of RPOs of $508 million from this year's first quarter. Almost all of the RPO increase this quarter was organic.\n Growth was broad-based, with each of the 5 segments growing RPO totals from both the year ago and 2021 periods. We are positioned in active nonresidential market sectors and continue to see velocity in our business.\n The 1-2 punch we highlighted in our first quarter call continued this quarter, where we experienced both strong revenue growth and total RPO growth. While some RPO growth thus far could be attributable costs due to outside factors, we continue to see an active bidding environment despite current supply disruptions and inflation challenges. Together, our domestic construction segments experienced strong project growth year-over-year, RPOs increasing over $1 billion or 25% from June 2021. The Mechanical Construction segments or RPOs increased by [indiscernible] or 23% while the Electrical Construction segment saw an increase of $350 million or nearly 30%. Since September '21, our domestic [indiscernible] segment RPOs have increased over $600 million.\n U.S. Building Services RPO levels increased $328 million or 44% from the year ago quarter and now is over $1 billion in quality projects and service [indiscernible]. As I mentioned earlier, extended lead times for HVAC equipment, combined with a continued push for energy efficiency and improving building wellness is resulting in our customers asking us to retrofit and repair their equipment. Additionally, strained equipment availability is driving our repair service, which is [indiscernible] grow margin work that we do at EMCOR. \n Moving to the right side of the page, we show RPOs broken down by market segment. Continuing to trend, RPO growth was based in the second quarter across market sectors with RPOs increasing almost $1.1 billion. $700 million of which was booked in the first half of 2022. Also, moving to this $1.1 billion increase for projects in the hyperscale data center, high-tech semiconductor arena as well as projects within [indiscernible] sciences and the pharma businesses. All of this shows the diversity and strength of EMCOR's end markets.\n Finishing our sector RPO growth year-over-year, health care RPOs are up 10%, institutional [indiscernible] and short-duration projects, which includes much of the HVAC retrofit project work are up 26%. Partially offsetting this was a reduction in transportation RPOs and as well as minor decreases in water and wastewater and industrial and manufacturing. From both a business segment and market perspective, I continue to like the balance and breadth of our RPOs.\n We get to go to my -- one of my favorite slides, which is Page 13. And I'd like you to turn there now, and we can talk about why we remain optimistic about EMCOR for the future. On this page, you see well positioned in growing nonresidential market interest. And I'm going to talk about each of these in turn. Data centers and semiconductor fabrication. And we have big news today in the semiconductor front and EMCOR will benefit from that because we are working with all those customers that will benefit. We'll see strong electrical, mechanical and fire protection demand across all those opportunities in semiconductors. And EMCOR is positioned well in Arizona, specifically mechanically. We are positioned well across the entire geography where there'll be some projects done with fire protection and capability in Arizona and burgeoning [indiscernible] Ohio on the [indiscernible] sector front.\n Data centers, it's tried to say, I believe there are none better at mechanical and electrical construction within data centers than our own companies. We have leading positions in some core geographical markets, and we can build from an enterprise level [indiscernible] to a high-tail data center using 50 megawatts hour. Our folks are terrific. And those teams in Portland and Salt Lake, Dine D.C., Gibson, Forest. These people are except data center builders on the electrical side. On the mechanical side, Bachelor & Kimball, Pool and Kent, F&G, our exceptional data center builders. They know their work. We're trusted by both our general contract customers and our owner customers. They come to us because we have great technical skill and they know that we have the financial strength to complete and finish those projects.\n In the industrial and manufacturing side, we are very well positioned. Mark talked about some of the ability to bring together a prime project across a number of trades, especially for plant relocations. We also are market leaders in food fabrication. If you go to that trade business, there are none better than Southern industrial contractors down in the Southeast. And they also move up into the lower Midwest. And we not only help people fix their existing facilities. We help them upgrade where they are [indiscernible] in moving and relocating equipment and building and manufacturing capacity.\n Our food processing expertise is [indiscernible] through our Shambaugh & Son. And we also, across a fleet of things are -- we can do as much as electrical charging station work [indiscernible], we need to be at the higher end of that, and we do that exceptionally well.\n Health care, that's always been a core market for EMCOR. We were integral and a lot of the things that had to happen within the pandemic to build extra capacity within the ecosystem. And we are now part of the retrofit and expansion of not only hospital systems, but medical buildings and outpatient surgery centers.\n Water and wastewater our market really for that for the most part. We do electrical work at different parts around the country. The bigger part of that work is mechanical. The team down at pool and Ken South and to some extent, Harry Pepper are very good at that work. And the [indiscernible] team has had a leading position in both the East and West Florida and helping with the population in the consent decrees that have happened there.\n Mechanical Services, if we are leading, we are within the top 3 of people that can provide mechanical services solutions. And those solutions that we provide not only provide efficiency, they provide building and resiliency, and they also now, with the pandemic, wellness has even become more important. The building efficiency is one of the major ways that you can drive carbon reduction. [indiscernible] happening across our footprint, right? Because as you increase the building wellness and increase outside air coming in, you have to even seek more efficiency within the building because outside actually at the detriment of building efficiency. It's a wonderful [indiscernible] for our people to meet our customers and for us to meet our carbon reduction goals that people -- that are client set. And we do that also through control solutions.\n Fire protection, there are none better then the teams of Shambaugh & Son and [indiscernible] to bring a solutions to some of the most complex service and construction jobs. And I'd be remiss not to say [indiscernible] also are going to be big participants across the portfolio of projects, not only renewables, but carbon reduction and capture project. We like our position that work, for the most part, is happening in segment. A lot of it's been delayed. And in our Industrial segment, where [indiscernible] will participate in solar projects, and they also help within wind projects on the transmission side as does Wasatch out in the Intermountain area.\n [indiscernible] participate a lot of robust market go up and down a little bit. But the general trend of these markets that I just went through are up into the right -- we spent a lot of time putting the assets in place, and we've got some of the best teams in the market executing against these opportunities.\n I'm going to go to Page 14 and 15 now. and I'm going to close off this discussion, and we'll take your questions. Entering this year, we knew that we would face some margin challenges. We were all the way back in February 2021, talking about supply chain with our year-end '21 call. And we also knew that because of our product and project mix, and you couple that with what we thought was happening with supply chain and COVID disruptions. I think our teams have done a great job in [indiscernible] these challenges in this operating environment. and we are pleased with our current position. We talked about demand for our services remain strong across most of our most important market sectors and in all of our reporting segments.\n As a result, we're going to update our guidance range. We now believe that we will achieve $7.30 to $7.80 in earnings per diluted share, and we expect at least $10.8 billion in revenue. Where we end up in that range, and I always sort of provide a road map of what could give you the ups or down. Where we end up in that range will depend not only on our execution, but also equipment and material [indiscernible]. We anticipate that we will continue to experience supply chain challenges. We do expect to convert operating income margins of 5% for the remainder of 2022, similar to what we achieved in the first half of the year. If we approve from margins due to better supply chain execution and improved productivity, we could see even stronger results in the back half of the year.\n How do you get there? And what are the backers that drive that? We expect to continue to achieve favorable SG&A leverage as compared to 2021. We expect to see strong project demand across key market sectors like industrial, manufacturing, health care and commercial, which includes both data center and semiconductor projects. We expect demand to be strong across a range of project sizes and scopes. We believe we'll continue to see very strong HVAC repair service demand as trends we observed this quarter continue through the third quarter. The summer heat we are seeing helps us.\n [indiscernible] a more normalized fall turnaround season in our Industrial Services segment with our oil and gas customers and our refining and petrochemical customers. We should start executing some renewable energy projects that are delayed because of material availability.\n While we are pleased with our current trajectory and optimistic about the balance of the year, we are also aware that we will continue to face headwinds in the near term. COVID is still here. And while we believe we have the systems in place to navigate and mitigate its challenges and keep our workforce safe, we expect that some project sites will be disrupted. Further supply chain issues exist with availability, delivery and pricing all [indiscernible] challenges. This will continue in my estimation through the balance of 2022 into 2023.\n Finally, with respect to challenges, we cannot ignore certain [indiscernible] in our macro environment. Rising interest rates, [indiscernible] lending and energy scarcity, exacerated by the conflict in Ukraine and other policy matters will cause issues. To date, as evidenced by our strong growth in RPOs, we believe we have the resilient market to operate in. However, when the leaders of major financial institutions cost projected market conditions, we [indiscernible] and we realize that it will likely [indiscernible]. We believe the outlook is strong despite all that, as evidenced by our year-to-date performance and our record RPOs of $6.5 billion.\n Our confidence in our business is reflected capital allocation strategy as we have returned a record amount of cash to shareholders, up $468 million through June 30, 2022. We announced an increase in our dividend by approximately 15% or $0.08 per share per annum, and our Board has provided, as Mark talked to our announcement today, an additional $500 million in authorization for share repurchases. We will continue to take a balanced approach to cash management, considering all the implications for maintaining and deploying funds, including maintaining cash and a strong balance sheet for our sureties, our investment in our organic growth, which has been quite strong, our acquisitions and our customer expectations for our financial strength. This approach to capital allocation has historically served us well. especially in periods of economic uncertainty. We [indiscernible] support our organic growth, and we have a decent pipeline of acquisitions to invest in across our segments.\n As always, I'd like to thank you for your interest in EMCOR. And I would like to especially thank all the members of our EMCOR team for their continued dedication, hard work and execution for our customers. And with that, I will ask Andrea to open the floor for your questions. It's growing, and I think we pointed it out in the commentary. What's driving that growth is -- you have to go back historically why it ended up there, right? Many, many years ago, it wasn't a major part of our business, and it was light manufacturing [indiscernible] enterprise data systems. Now, it's a bigger part of the business, but it's now data centers is driving the growth, high-tech manufacturing in general and more of what we were doing just build-out work, but now we're doing bigger work, life sciences, pharma and other types of that kind of manufacturing. And we still have pretty strong demand driving that growth, as we talked about in building services, there is all commercial for the most part. And that demand drives along HVAC retrofit projects, and most of those are in typical commercial.\n But Sean, you're pointing out something, it's growing as a bigger business. It's what's driving that commercial backlog increase, and that's why we took the time in our RPO section to talk about that. Mark? Yes. So I'm going to kick this to Mark in a minute. But broadly, I said of around and 10 or 20 basis points, your right can move that. But Sean, the -- most of our caution of saying that number is around the macro environment and supply chain. It's hard for me today to tell you that the supply chain is all fixed and it's clear selling. Lead times are terrible. OEMs are routinely missing those terrible lead times. And that has implications for us. And so for us, to sort of sit here and not caution that would be irresponsible, I think.\n And then secondarily, we have work that's now going to be starting that's favorable to our mix. that should be further along than it is. And we're not exactly sure. A month means a lot when you start up a large project on equipment deliveries. And most of those larger projects, we're in concert with our customers ordering that equipment. They're actually buying it ahead of time. And we will start up when that equipment is there and that could be delayed. It can start 2 weeks from now, they can start 4 weeks from now, it can start 6 weeks from now. And Mark, I think that's where our caution is. Thanks, Adam. We don't give forward-looking guidance. But the reality is I go back to longer-term trends. And I go back to Page 13 in our presentation and talk about those sectors and most of them will be up into the right. Do I specifically know what will happen in 3 of the small project work? No, I don't. Do I know on what new awards -- No, I don't. But clearly, our average project length is somewhere 9 to 12 months. Some of these are longer term. And we'll see when they start up and then they finish. Again, we don't give forward guidance into '23. I mean in our business, we're always cautious to say write-downs go away. We've had a hell of a run without any significant losses. But our folks are working in unprecedented times, especially with respect to supply chain. And most of the write-downs we had in the first half of the year were on projects we took prior to the supply chain and inflation cycle. But that being said, there's a lot of moving pieces. So we actually -- I would just refer you back to the previous question on the 5 -- around 5% margin. we don't see anything or absolutely we would have taken it, right? That's how this business works. But we don't expect it, we would have taken it. And our electrical business has a good mix of work. And a lot of that margin progression to be dependent on our ability to start some of that favorable mix work will all be related to supply chain. Adam, I mean, in all fairness, right, these aren't big giant project write-downs. This is more -- like Mark said, we're getting to the end of the project. Two of them were specifically stopped and started not only through the pandemic, but because of the supply chain. That's never good for a contractor, right? As you reassemble the team and get going again.\n And look, what we're known for EMCOR is we will finish the work. But then what we're also known for is not reflected in these write-downs, is our ability to go win what we think will have partial entitlement. Because customer hasn't made an offer back the other way, we're putting together the case, our guys are pretty [indiscernible], and we'll see what happens. But I wouldn't term these on the same magnitude as what we had 8 years ago on a specific job.\n I mean, these are -- in some ways, what happens in business when you get to a period of a very choppy environment where you have either on a disruption in the job site. One of them specifically [indiscernible] carry on -- further carry on from the first quarter, we thought we had it all, but one of them specifically was workforce-related, right? And it was related to our ability to get the right workforce on and at COVID disruption, we're working more over time. We finished the job. We have a great reputation. Life goes on.\n And I will tie that back to the earlier point. One of the reasons that we win this big work, this complex technical work is, hey, we got the best people in the field to execute this work. And we can assemble and put on fill the best people. And also, people know that we are thoughtful in [indiscernible] our balance sheet. So the work will get done and that we understand that we manage this business through cycles. And look, I think we're -- with the RPOs we have lined up, we feel pretty good about managing through this cycle. But again, we will see, right? I mean there was a negative GDP growth print today. I don't know what that means for our business. I just feel really good about where we are on Page 12 and 13 right now, which are RPOs and markets we have to work in. We don't see that. Could there be a short-term disruption? We don't see that. But anything we study, anything we talk to these major builders, we don't see a pullback. I think anything you're hearing around pullback is their frustration around the supply chain. I mean just for amplification on that. All these data centers, for the most part, are backed up by either natural gas generators or diesel generators. That's now up to 52 weeks. So as they try to think through how they're going to sequence these data center to come on, they have to take that in their planning.\n The [indiscernible] come in, these are 50-megawatt facilities. There's a substation build outside almost every one of them a substation two for one. Just to put in perspective, what 50 megawatts is, 50 megawatts of power about 1,500 to 2,000 [indiscernible]. Let us put this in perspective, what's happening here. Which gear to do that is 42 weeks right now. So [indiscernible], I think that people are feeling is, can we get the supply chain to make delivery?\n And then you get to the UPS system. It can take anywhere a square footage-wise, imagine a commercial 2 floors of a typical commercial office building, 60,000 square feet. That's the battery room to run that data center somewhere between 1 minute and 1.5 minutes until the generator kicks on. So these are the kind of systems that are more difficult to acquire right now. And I think that's what's causing -- and that's what caused the delay in our electrical business. So what's good news for us is those deliveries are going to start coming. We had pretty good performance without that in our mix. And then as we get through the back half of the year and into next year, that should be a favorable mix for us. It should, coupled with repair service demand. Mike [indiscernible] team right now sleep with one eye open and equipment deliveries. Not 100% sure that all of these manufacturers are going to meet their commitments. Me, look, I'll be blunt. I was in this game 18, 20 years ago. They are all terrible at deliveries right now. They are not performing and they are communicating terribly. I am very fortunate to work with the team that stay on top of this every day and are very good and understanding the language back from those OEMs with respect to their equipment deliveries and the fulfillment of those deliveries.\n We got the best team in the business, interpreting those results. But all 4 of them are terrible right now. In general, nothing [indiscernible] in our philosophy. We've been balanced capital allocators for a while here at EMCOR. And I think in any given situation, you tell us Tony invest like crazy in organic growth when you have. And quite frankly, we have. We spent a little more on capital. Mark talked about the growth in AR. One of the big considerations we think about on a large project is what is cash flow characteristics of that project. And we know that sometimes an investment somewhere in the middle of the project. And one of the reasons we win some of those large projects. I mean, first is always technical capability, but also people look at it and said, you guys run a contract or the way you should run a contractor.\n And that's for the conservative balance sheet that we can figure it done. The second thing is we're very conscious with our authorities and talk about the relationship with them. We have great relationships with leading surety companies, and they appreciate how we run that and keep that balance sheet. Mark has done this for a long period of time with them to the point where the trust-based relationship we have there allows our people with confidence to go out and look at jobs and not worry about surety.\n And Mark, I think we have about $1.5 billion of that out there right now? And alongside Surety Credit says the conversations we have with these large projects people, whether they be in hyperscale data centers, semiconductor work, health care facilities, where they'll work with our people, our General Counsel, and they'll say -- and us and say, we get it, but can we put a corporate care around that. And that all ties back to that thoughtfulness that we have around capital allocation and a strong balance sheet. So organic growth would always come first.\n And then I think after that, then we have the dividend which we think is a commitment over time. And we just increased it, and we feel good about that. And then we balance the capital allocation between share repurchases and acquisitions. The reality is, we've been fairly returning cash to shareholders since 2017, '18, especially, I think $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion has now been returned to shareholders through share repurchases. I give our CFO a ton of credit for how he thinks through that with his team and how they execute it.\n And then we clearly were exiting the year last year with a big cash position. Now, we built that big cash position because we're one of the best cash generators in the business over time from continuing from our operations. But we also had a dislocation, right, going from '19 to '20 with the pandemic. And in this business, the revenue shrunk and we threw up a lot of -- we knew we had this onetime mark [indiscernible] of excess cash. What was either going to get put to work [indiscernible] positions were going to get put to work with buyback. And then when we saw the dislocation, I would not just say in our stock, but in the market through the first 6 months of the year, we thought it was a comp on us to step in and repurchase shares because reality is versus any [indiscernible] acquisition we could have made for EMCOR, the best company we could buy at that multiple was EMCOR in the first 6 months of this year.\n So think about all this, we think about it over time. And all in [indiscernible] we've been acquirers a good place order somewhere between $150 million and $300 million a year. And the best deals that happen with us are people that are selling their life's work going to be part of the future.\n And recently, we did Quibi Holdings. Dennis Quibi and Buck Ross out there in Ohio, terrific company, great reputation. We feel really good about our future together. Several years ago, the team down in Atlanta and B&K that have a great presence in the Southeast and are probably some of the best leading edge people in BIM and prefabrication in the industry. And we worked together. They taught us a lot. We've taught them a lot. It's been a great group of people to have on our team. And then the whole fire protection build-out, going all the way back to Comunale and the organic at Shambaugh and Comunale, coupled with acquisitions, to build out that portfolio around the Shambaugh platform. \n And then the fabrication shops, investments we made on top of that, not only in Akron, Ohio, with Comunale but Fort Wayne, Indiana, and in Alabama, right by one of the big pipe producers [indiscernible] in Arizona. These are all thoughtful expansions of capacity to allow us to serve our customers after an acquisition strategy that helped us gain access to not only new capabilities in that market, but also geographic presence.\n And then you go to mechanical services where we -- within a geography, maybe buy a platform and then build it out much like we've done in Florida and in California. The Mesa team -- I mean, it's a remarkable story over a long period of time of the application of capital, acquisition capital and organic capital to go from a small, pretty good capability, Orange County-focused HVAC contractor with Bob Lake and Charlie Fletcher and the team out there to a -- I would say, the leading controls and HVAC service company across basically, 4 states in the West. And [indiscernible] a terrific job, and it's pushing on $200-plus million now. And that's been mostly organic, but it's been the application of capital to buy small contractors in the market and geographically fit it out.\n And we see those opportunities in front of us. And I think you know me, we always have said deals happen when they happen. We're always in the market. And we haven't been that successful over the last 4 years, 5 years, in competition with private equity on [indiscernible]. Part of that is our choice. I've never been a [indiscernible]. We got good visibility down through the organization on buying somebody else's consolidation or roll up -- they're roll ups. We're not -- we are operators. And I've never been a big fan of that unless we can really get down in the organization to understand who's running the local operations. And so we've sort of stayed away from it.\n And look, at the end of the day, we're going to buy what we're good at. We are good at trade contracting. We are a service and we are with highly technical people, and we are very -- and that's really the theme that unites all those segments. And we are very good at taking something that's very -- that's well run, helping us make it a little better run and then growing it once we buy it.\n So nothing's really changed, and I think we'll just keep executing the way we've been executing. Yes. Again, I spent a little time on that because it's always important to reiterate, which made us really good over a long period of time. We don't react to FADs and we just continue to execute. And I think that's the nature of the work we do.\n Anybody else, operator? Yes. So I'm just going to finish the way I started. I'd like to thank all the folks that continue to support us and have listened to and supported our growth story over a long period of time. And I would really like to thank our segment and field leadership and our corporate staff. It's been -- really, great execution over a long period of time. And these last 3 years, they've been tough, right? But [indiscernible] to be big excuse makers, and we're going to continue that.\n And I think what's made us successful is we think through everything carefully, and we very rarely go off that track. And with that, we run by a set of values of mission first people always and our people love to execute for their customers and take care of their people, and we'll continue to do that.\n We'll talk to you in the third quarter. Be careful in the heat, and if you have it, you can't get your air conditioner fixed, look for your local [indiscernible] on our website. And with that, I'll let you go."

            "content": "Thank you, Tony, and good morning to everyone participating in the call today. For those accessing this presentation on webcast, now on Slide 7. As Tony indicated, over the next several slides, I will supplement Tony's opening commentary on EMCOR's second quarter performance as well as provide a brief update on our year-to-date results through [indiscernible]. All financial information referenced this morning is derived from our consolidated financial statements in both our earnings release announcement and Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this morning.\n So let's revisit and expand our review of EMCOR's second quarter performance. Consolidated revenues of $2.71 billion are up $269.7 million or 11.1% over quarter 2 2021. Our second quarter results include $33.7 million of revenues attributable to businesses acquired, pertaining to [indiscernible] such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in last year's second quarter. Acquisition revenues positively impacted our United States Construction segment within the second quarter.\n Before reviewing the operating results of our individual segments, I would like to highlight that our $2.71 billion of quarterly revenues represents a new all-time quarterly revenue record for the company despite the [indiscernible] in the United Kingdom Building Services segment revenues which was largely due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements.\n The specifics to each of our reportable segments are as follows: United States Electrical Construction segment revenues of $564.1 million increased $72 million or 14.6% from 2021's comparable quarter. Excluding incremental acquisition revenues, this segment's revenues grew organically [indiscernible] quarter-over-quarter. Increased project activity within the commercial market sector, inclusive of the telecommunication and high-tech submarket sectors as well as growth in each of the health care, manufacturing, water and wastewater market sectors were the primary drivers of the period-over-period improvement.\n Partially offsetting these increases was a decline in revenues from the institutional market sector due to the completion or substantial completion of certain projects performed in the corresponding 2021 period.\n United States Mechanical Construction segment revenues of $1.066 billion increased $97.7 million or 10.1% from quarter 2 2021. The Revenue growth during the quarter was derived strictly from organic activities within the majority of the market sectors we serve, the manufacturing, water and wastewater and institutional market sector is experiencing the most significant period-over-period increases.\n We also continue to see revenue growth within the commercial market sector, driven by demand from customers within the semiconductor and life sciences industries.\n Second, revenues for EMCOR's combined United States construction businesses of $1.63 billion increased $169.7 million or 11.6% from quarter 2 2021.\n United States Services quarterly revenues of $677.8 million increased $66 million or 10.8%. Revenue growth was generated within the segment's commercial site-based and Mechanical Services divisions. With respect to commercial site-based activity, [indiscernible] additions and scope or site expansion with existing customers were the drivers of the quarterly increase in revenues.\n Within Mechanical Services, we have seen a continuation of the trends that existed in quarter 1. Notably, we have experienced an increase in service repair and maintenance volumes partially as supply chain delays have resulted in the need to extend the useful lives of HVAC equipment in instances when new equipment is not readily available. In addition, there continues to be a high demand for building one in [indiscernible], with an emphasis on improving building efficiency, energy consumption and indoor air quality.\n Industrial Services segment revenues of $284.5 million increased $49.3 million or 21%. Revenue in the segment have grown in comparison for the comparable prior year period for each of the last 4 quarters as we are expecting some stabilization in demand for our downstream focused services. This has led to an increase in field services with some [indiscernible] spring turnarounds as well as greater maintenance and capital project activity.\n This growth is despite the headwinds within the upstream and midstream energy sectors, which is impacting certain of our service lines. We have also seen an increase in shop services revenue to new equipment, as well as pull-through repair projects resulting from ongoing turnarounds. With refinery utilization levels in excess of 90%, we remain hopeful that the last 6 months of 2022 will provide market condition that can perpetuate this segment's recent trend of improved results.\n United Kingdom Building Services revenues of $114.6 million decreased $15.3 million. This revenue contraction was predominantly attributable to unfavorable exchange movements of $12.5 million in the quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the growth in project activity within the segment was more than offset by a reduction in service contract revenues due to the loss of certain contracts not successfully obtained at rebid.\n Please turn to Slide 8. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $245.4 million represent 9.1% of increase of $2.4 million from quarter 2 2021. For incremental expenses attributable to companies acquired of $3.1 million, inclusive of intangible asset amortization, EMCOR's SG&A expenses for the quarter declined slightly on an organic basis. As a reminder, 2021 second quarter [indiscernible] a $4.1 million provision for credit loss within our U.S. Industrial Services segment related to a customer bankruptcy. Our credit loss activity in the current year second quarter is substantially less, contributing to the period-over-period organic SG&A decline.\n Despite adding personnel to support strong organic revenue growth and travel and entertainment expenses continuing to trend higher as business travel resumes a [indiscernible]. We have been successfully leverage our cost structure, resulting in a reduction in our SG&A margin. We can main disciplined with overhead investment and we'll seek efficiencies and economies of scale as we drive future revenue growth.\n Reported operating income for the quarter of $137.6 million favorably compares to $133.4 million operating income [indiscernible] second quarter. Quarter 2 operating margins of 5.1% is down [indiscernible] basis points from 2021 second quarter and is largely due to a less favorable revenue mix within our U.S. construction operations, which I will cover in my segment commentary.\n As a reminder, our second quarter 2021 consolidated operating margin of 5.5% represented a quarter 2 record. Specific quarterly operating performance by reporting segment is as follows: operating income of our U.S. Electrical Construction Services segment of $35.1 million decreased $7.9 million from the comparable 2021 period. Reported operation of 6.2% represents a reduction from the 8.7% in last year's second quarter. The decrease in both operating income and operating margin is due to a less favorable project mix within the commercial, institutional and transportation market sectors when compared to the prior year period.\n In addition, we did experience certain discrete project write-downs this quarter that reduced this segment's operating income by [indiscernible]. These losses negatively Electrical Construction quarter 2 operating margin by 140 basis points. Further, [indiscernible] from quarter 1, we continue to experience labor productivity and efficiency challenges due to supply chain difficulties resulting in equipment delivery delays, which has impacted project timelines. Although this segment continues to lag 2022 performance, we are reporting substantial sequential improvement in both margin and operating income dollars when compared to the first quarter of this year.\n Second, operating income of our U.S. Mechanical Construction segment of $76.9 million was essentially flat with the comparable 2021 period. Reported operating margin of 7.2% represents a 70 basis point reduction from the 7.9% earned a year ago. As referenced during the last 2 quarters, our Mechanical Construction segment has a larger number of active projects within the manufacturing and water and wastewater market sectors where we are either acting as a construction manager or general contractor in the [indiscernible], the percentage of our self-performed labor is less than a typical mechanical construction project, thereby resulting in our gross margin profile. This segment additionally experienced certain project write-downs during the quarter, which negatively impacted operating margin by 40 basis points.\n Consistent with our Electrical Construction quarterly performance, U.S. Mechanical Construction sequentially improved, both reported operating margin and operating income dollars from quarter 1 of this year. Operating [indiscernible] Building Services is $38.2 or 5.6% of revenues, which represents a $5.6 million increase in operating income and a [indiscernible] basis point improvement in operating margin.\n Operating performance within the segment's Mechanical Services division, both favorable project execution as well as the impact of certain price adjustments aimed at better aligning our billing rates with the increased costs we have experienced were the key drivers of this segment's increases in operating income and operating income margin.\n Our U.S. Industrial Services segment operating $6.5 million represents a $6.7 million improvement from the [indiscernible] operating loss reported in 2021 second quarter. This is our Industrial segment's third consecutive operating profit since reporting periods prior to the pandemic, albeit at operating margin remained lower than historical levels as we continue to battle a competitive pricing environment and higher cost inflationary headwinds. On a positive note, anticipated projects are either occurring or scheduled [indiscernible] during the remainder of 2022, in line with our initial planning expectations.\n U.K. Building Services operating income of $6.4 million or 5.6% of revenues represents a slight decrease from the quarter of 2021 due to the unfavorable exchange rates for the pound sterling versus the United States dollar. We continue to experience strong project demand within this segment as our customer base advance capital investment programs, which is contributing to the 20 basis points of operating margin expansion per year.\n We are now on Slide 9. Additional financial items of significance for the quarter [indiscernible] in the previous slides are as follows: quarter 2 gross profit of $383 million is higher than the comparable 2021 by $6.7 million or just under 2%, however, gross margin of 14.1% is lower than last year's second quarter due to the reasons covered during my operating expense commentary, including project mix, supply chain difficulties and construction project write-downs.\n Incremental revenues helped us achieve a new second quarter gross profit record, but prevailing macroeconomic headwinds are hindering our ability to maximize profit conversion. Diluted earnings per common share in the second quarter of 2022 is $1.99 as compared to $1.78 per diluted share for the prior year period. This second quarter EPS performance represents quarterly earnings per share record due to a combination of greater net income and a reduction in our weighted average shares [indiscernible] given the new share activity.\n Please turn to Slide 10. With the quarterly commentary complete, I will touch on the highlights with respect to EMCOR's results for the first 6 months of 2022. Revenues of $5.3 billion represent an increase of $558 million or 11.8% [indiscernible] was generated organically. Operating income of $237.6 million or 4.5% of revenues represents a 5.1% reduction from the results for the first 6 months of 2021 as our improved second quarter 2022 performance was not enough to offset slow start in quarter 1. With our increased share repurchase activity and corresponding reduction in shares outstanding, today, diluted earnings per share of $3.36 equips is that of the prior year to $3.32.\n Turning to Slide 11. Headed by the strength of our balance sheet, EMCOR remains a vision to invest in our business, return capital to shareholders and against our strategic objectives. Our cash on hand has declined from year-end 2021 levels as we have allocated $454.3 million towards the repurchase of our common stock during the first months of calendar 2022. Approximately $272.5 million of this amount was [indiscernible] during the second quarter as equity market volatility continued due to inflationary and interest rate [indiscernible].\n The midpoint of this year then doubled our previous high for share repurchases, [indiscernible] cash to shareholders our quarterly dividend, which amounted to $13.6 million during the year-to-date period has been [indiscernible] when evaluating the working capital investment necessary to sustain our strong organic revenue growth as well as our future opportunities in addition to our [indiscernible] for both capital and strategic investments. In addition to our share repurchase and dividend activity, additional factors for the period-over-period decline in our reported cash balance include $26.6 million in payments for acquisitions and $27.7 million in capital expenditures.\n In addition to cash, other movements in our balance sheet of note are as follows: Working capital has decreased by nearly $307 million. The decrease in cash just referenced coupled with an increase in our net contract liability position was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable given the revenue growth during the period. Goodwill has increased marginally since December of last year, given the acquisitions completed by us thus far in 2022. Net identifiable intangible assets have decreased by approximately $12 million during 2022 as amortization expense has more than offset the additional intangible assets recognized in connection with our year-to-date acquisition activity.\n Total debt, exclusive of operating liabilities remains fairly consistent with that as of December, and EMCOR's debt to capitalization ratio has increased from 10.4% at year-end 2021 to 11.8% at June 30, 2022, given the reduction in our shareholders' equity resulting from our share repurchase activity during the 6 months.\n To pick up from both Tony and my earlier comments, EMCOR remains committed to our capital allocation strategy, [indiscernible] by both our share repurchase activity to date as well as today's announcement that our Board of Directors has approved an additional $500 million authorization under our share repurchase program, an increase in dividend of approximately 15%.\n With my portion of this morning's slide presentation is complete, I will now return the call back to Tony. Tony? Yes. I mean just to reamplify what Tony just said. For -- not to go for the reasons again, that Tony just mentioned, but included in our commercial RPO disclosure or all those things that Tony just highlighted as major growth areas and have been major contributors to our profitability over the last several years, we're reticent to change how we're categorizing that at a midpoint in a year, but it's something that we need to evaluate internally as we go forward to provide the analytical community, I guess, more written transparency than transparency we're already providing forward with regards to what those actually represent. Yes. And obviously, Tony is around 5% as it is indicated. Can mean something in the low 5% range. So clearly, as you did the math, I'm sure you came out with operating margins of 5.2% or 5.3% in the back half of the year. So clearly, no worse than they were in the second quarter and significantly higher than they were in quarter 1 and at the 6-month point on a cumulative basis. So the variable there, once again, is the revenue number. So of that $10.8 billion of guided revenues ends up creeping up. It's quite possible we get at the same point at a 5% or 5.1% margin level for the last 6 months. Adam, I'm going to just interject quickly. So Tony's point, obviously, to the extent that we've identified, the necessity to take a write-down. We've taken 100% of it in the second quarter, but we can't defer to later periods as I'm sure everyone in the call well knows. The only additional thing I'll add to Tony's commentary is that these projects are still active projects, so they create a little bit of margin headwind in that segment because we're going to be recognizing profit on the remaining revenues at a margin profile lower than what the segment traditionally [indiscernible]. That's the negative aspect of it. The fast fact is with regard to the projects that were written down, both in electric production and mechanical construction. They're all over -- they're well over 50% complete, some of them are even closer to 100% complete. So they are clearly not going to be the preponderance of revenues that are recognized in these segments as we work through the last 6 months of 2022. A little bit more."

And I'm going to be on Pages 4 to 6 to start, and I'd like to thank all of you for joining us this morning. On our February 24, year-end call, I described the current operating environment that we experienced in the first quarter as one of the toughest that I had seen in my career. This remained the case through the first quarter of 2022. However, at EMCOR, we do have a no excuses culture. We have to adapt to an ever-changing operating environment. We are executing with discipline and flexibility as we navigate this challenging environment. Overall, the quarter went about as expected for us, with a little more pressure on operating income margins in our Domestic Construction and Building Services segments due to the disruptions caused by supply chain issues and the Omicron variant. Further, the Ukraine war added another layer of uncertainty, especially with respect to energy and some raw material costs. We will cover the supply chain issues later in both mine and Mark's comments. In the quarter, we earned revenues of $2.59 billion, operating income of $100 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.39. We had very strong organic revenue growth of 10.8% in the aggregate across our domestic segments with our Industrial segment leading the way at 32%. Our project pipeline remains strong with a good mix of projects. We saw an increase of RPOs to a record $5.95 billion versus $4.78 billion in the year ago period. Our combined operating income margins were 3.9% as we fought through increased fuel costs and difficult supply chains in the quarter that disrupted many projects and prevented us from achieving our expected labor productivity. As we evaluate the quarter, I thought I would cover the business more broadly versus on a segment-by-segment basis as many of these trends, both positive and negative and challenges, cut across our entire business. First, let me cover what I think is going well. Our end markets continue to be resilient, and we are winning work in the right places at the right prices. Again, we are winning work at the -- in the right places at the right prices. As I just mentioned, we grew RPOs 25% in the aggregate and 21% organically versus the year ago period. I will cover that in more detail when I review RPOs after Mark's commentary. Our Industrial Services segment is performing as expected and had a heck of a rebound to a more normal operating environment not seen since 2019. We are proving our resilience every day as we execute and complete work under what are difficult operating conditions. The disruption caused by the Omicron variants are dissipated as we exited Q1. Hopefully, such disruptions caused by COVID are behind us. We are having significant success in attracting the right mix of skilled craft labor to execute our work. We kept our field leadership and labor intact. In the short run, there was a cost to us as the issues we experienced in the quarter affected labor productivity. However, we made that decision that with our high-level RPOs and the current bidding environment, we should not reduce our key labor resources, especially our field leadership, such as our foremen. We are proactively managing our pricing and believe that we have caught up with customer pricing in our Building Services segment with respect to fuel and MRO, that is maintenance, repair and other type material charges as we exit the quarter. Our team is very good at adapting and developing contingency plans with respect to our supply chain. We've had to find work around as supply chain has become more volatile with respect to on-time delivery and delivering a complete order. But that's what we're good at, finding solutions for difficult circumstances, and we will continue to adapt as needed. What has proven to be more challenging than we had contemplated in early 2022 are the following: The continued rise in energy prices, especially for gasoline and diesel leads to margin compression, and that's most notably within Building Services but even more broadly as it impacts our project pricing as we develop overhead rates. Despite the continued energy price inflation, we believe that we have, for the most part, appropriately adjusted our pricing models to reflect these costs. Supply chain challenges were worse than we expected, and it's been in a difficult supply chain and it became even more challenging due to the impact of the Omicron surge and the conflict in Ukraine had on our suppliers. The Ukraine conflict has impacted not only the price of gasoline and natural gas and diesel. It has also impacted the price and availability of certain metals like nickel, which is a key component of stainless steel and pig iron, which is a key component of cast-iron pipe. While we understand how to price and contract our work in an environment of increasing lead times and prices, we also encountered missed deliveries and incomplete shipments during the quarter. These disruptions resulted in reduced labor efficiency on certain of our projects. Such supply chain disruptions and the Omicron surge at the start of the quarter resulted in some very good project work being delayed and also prevented us from being able to close out some very successful projects. As I turn the commentary to Mark, I remain confident in our segment and subsidiary leadership and our team skills and resourcefulness to mitigate these challenges and build on our strengths as we move forward in 2022. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark.\nMark Pompa : Thank you, Tony, and good morning to everyone participating on the call today. For those accessing this presentation via the webcast, we are now on Slide 7. Over the next several slides, I will augment Tony's opening commentary and review each of our reportable segment's first quarter operating performance as well as other key financial data derived from our consolidated financial statements included in both our earnings release announcement and Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this morning. So let's expand our review of EMCOR's first quarter performance. As Tony mentioned, consolidated revenues of $2.59 billion are up $288.5 million or 12.5% over quarter 1 2021. Our first quarter results include $49.5 million of revenues attributable to businesses acquired pertaining to the period of time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in last year's first quarter. Acquisition revenues positively impacted each of our United States Electrical Construction and United States Building Services segments. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired, first quarter consolidated revenues increased approximately $239 million or a strong 10.4% quarter-over-quarter. Before reviewing the operating results of our individual reporting segments, I would like to highlight that each of our segments had strong revenue growth in the quarter and that our consolidated revenues of $2.59 billion represent a new first quarter record that is only eclipsed by 2021's fourth quarter, which generated the highest quarterly revenue in our long history. Tony has previously commented on the challenging operating environment that existed during the quarter and continues to persist to some extent. So one might question why am I highlighting a first quarter revenue record in light of the fact that it did not equate to record operating income or diluted earnings per share performance? The simple answer is that our business performance and growth prospects remain strong, and we collectively should not lose sight of this despite the economic headwinds that are impacting us. We continue to generate strong organic revenue growth while simultaneously growing our remaining performance obligations in most of the market sectors that we serve. So although we have experienced some choppiness in our first quarter results due mostly to external factors, we have not eroded our strong foundation and currently believe we will meet our annual targets barring any worsening of the macroeconomic conditions. With that being said, I will now cover the results of each of our reportable segments during the quarter, starting with revenue. United States Electrical Construction quarter 1 revenues of $522 million increased $62.6 million or 13.6% from 2021's comparable quarter. Excluding incremental acquisition revenues of $34.9 million, this segment's grew -- this segment's revenues grew organically 6% quarter-over-quarter. Increased project activity within the commercial market sector, exclusive of the telecommunications submarket sector as well as growth in each of the manufacturing, health care and transportation market sectors were the primary contributors to this segment's quarterly revenue growth. Offsetting these increases was a decline in revenues from the telecommunications submarket sector due to the sequencing of projects in the current year as well as project delivery delays as our customers await the receipt of critical equipment due to supply chain disruptions. Both of these factors have resulted in the shift of project work to later in 2022. United States Mechanical Construction segment revenues of $1 billion increased $86 million or 9.4% from quarter 1 2021. Revenue growth during the quarter was derived from the majority of the market sectors we serve, with the water and wastewater, manufacturing and commercial market sector is experiencing the most significant period-over-period increases. Revenue growth within the manufacturing market sector was concentrated in large food processing projects, while the growth in commercial market sector revenues was driven by demand from certain customers within the semiconductor, biotech, life sciences and pharmaceutical industries. This increased activity augmented the continued demand for our fire protection services, particularly from those of our customers building out their e-commerce supply chains. Both our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments established new first quarter revenue records in 2022. United States Building Services segment revenues of $627.8 million increased $59.8 million or 10.5% and represents an all-time quarterly record for this segment. Excluding incremental acquisition contribution of $14.6 million, this segment's revenues increased $45.2 million or 8% organically. Revenue growth was generated within the segment's commercial site-based mechanical and Government Services divisions. With respect to commercial site-based and government services, new customer additions and scope expansion with existing customers were the primary drivers of the quarterly increase in revenues. Within Mechanical Services, a number of trends have favorably impacted us from a revenue perspective. Notably, we have seen an increase in service repair and maintenance volumes, partially as supply chain delays have resulted in the need to extend the useful lives of HVAC equipment in instances when replacement equipment is not readily available. In addition, there continues to be high demand for our building automation and control services with an emphasis on improving building efficiency and energy consumption, which is a priority for many of our customers in light of both increasing energy prices and a heightened focus on their environmental impact in the context of ESG. United States Industrial Services segment revenues of $310.7 million increased $75.3 million or 32%. As I commented during our earnings calls for the second half of 2021, we have begun to see some resumption in demand for maintenance and capital spending from this segment's customer base in the back half of last year. Such demand patterns continued through the first quarter of 2022 as we executed against a more normal spring turnaround season with improved demand for both field and shop services. Unfortunately, some of the macroeconomic headwinds that have been prevalent within the broader oil and gas industry persist, but with U.S. refinery utilization in excess of 90%, we are hopeful that 2022 will continue to develop favorably and that this segment's operating results will reflect that of a more normal pre-pandemic 12-month period. United Kingdom Building Services segment revenues of $131.5 million increased $4.8 million or 3.8% due to continued strong project volumes across their customer portfolio. Unfavorable exchange rate movements due to the weakening of the pound sterling negatively impacted this segment's quarter 1 2022 revenues by $3.9 million. Please turn to Slide 8. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $252.6 million represent 9.7% of first quarter revenues and compared to $224.1 million and 9.7% of revenues in the year ago period. SG&A for the first quarter includes approximately $5.2 million of incremental expenses from businesses acquired, inclusive of intangible asset amortization, resulting in an organic increase in SG&A of $23.3 million. With EMCOR's substantial revenue growth, we are adding personnel to support our back office and contract administration functions, resulting in increases in salaries and benefits from the corresponding 2021 period. Additionally, we continue to see an increase in medical expenses as claim activity related to both routine medical visits and elective procedures continues to normalize after being suppressed during 2020 and the early part of 2021. Travel and entertainment expenses have also increased as our team resumed certain business travel, although still below pre-pandemic levels. As previously disclosed, our SG&A as a percentage of revenues was flat at 9.7% for both quarter 1 periods. Reported operating income for the quarter was approximately $100 million or 3.9% of revenues and compares to operating income of $117 million or 5.1% of revenues a year ago. As a reminder, 2021's quarter 1 performance represented first quarter records for both operating income and operating margin. The overall decline in operating income and margin within the current quarter was due to quarter-over-quarter decreases in gross margins within each of our U.S. Electrical Construction, U.S. Mechanical Construction and U.S. Building Services segments. These reductions offset quarterly gains in both our U.S. Industrial Services and U.K. Building Services segments. Specific quarterly operating income performance by segment is as follows: Our U.S. Electrical Construction segment operating income of $20 million decreased $20.3 million from the comparable 2021 period. Reported operating margins of 3.8% represents a reduction from the 8.8% reported in last year's first quarter. The decrease in both operating income and operating margin is due to the reduction in both gross profit and gross profit margin previously mentioned, which was largely attributable to a change in this segment's project mix within the commercial market sector. In addition, whereas the prior year period benefited from the favorable progression on several extremely profitable projects, the current year's quarter was impacted by our customers' project schedules, which is heavily weighted towards the back half of the year. Lastly, and as previously mentioned, we experienced project delivery delays during the quarter due to supply chain difficulties impacting the receipt of equipment. These supply chain delays not only impacted project timelines, but also led to labor productivity and efficiency challenges, which is a major contributor to the significant reduction in this segment's operating margin quarter-over-quarter. First quarter operating income of our U.S. Mechanical Construction segment of $58.7 million represents a $4.5 million decrease from last year's quarter and operating margin of 5.9% represents a 100 basis point reduction from the 6.9% earned a year ago. As referenced during our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call, our Mechanical Construction segment currently has a larger number of contracts within the manufacturing and water and wastewater market sectors where we are either acting as construction manager or general contractor. In these cases, the percentage of our self-performed labor is less than typical, resulting in lower gross margin profile. This segment additionally experienced labor productivity issues resulting from supply chain disruptions as well as project write-downs resulting from material price escalation, a portion for which we will seek future recovery. Operating income for U.S. Building Services is $23.9 million or 3.8% of revenues and compares to $31.1 million or 5.5% of revenues in 2021's first quarter. Given a reduction in gross profit margin within this segment increased gross profit dollars resulting from the previously referenced revenue growth during the period was more than offset by an increase in SG&A expenses. Gross margin has declined due to a less favorable project mix within this segment's Mechanical Services division due to a higher percentage of fixed price capital projects, which typically have lower gross profit margins than this division's other service and repair offerings. Further impacting gross profit margin was a shift in the portfolio of project work being performed by the segment's commercial site-based services division, including a quarter-over-quarter decline and certain add-on work, such as COVID-19-related cleaning and sanitation services and an increase in more traditional facilities maintenance-type projects. In addition, our U.S. Building Services segment experienced unabsorbed labor costs due to supply chain disruptions where project delivery either has been delayed or job site productivity and efficiency has suffered due to incomplete shipments of material or equipment. Lastly, within the quarter, escalating fuel prices have reduced profitability as such prices increased at a faster rate than the fuel surcharges to our customers, which typically can only be adjusted after we experience the underlying cost increase. Though we were impacted in the quarter, as Tony referenced in his opening commentary, we have once again adjusted our pricing to account for these inflationary pressures. Our U.S. Industrial Services segment operating income of $13.3 million represents a $15.7 million improvement from the $2.4 million operating loss reported in 2021's first quarter. In the small victory column, this represents our Industrial segment's second consecutive quarter of operating profit since reporting periods prior to the pandemic. As referenced during my revenue commentary, we experienced more normalized demand during the quarter within both the segment's field and shop services operations. Turnarounds that we had forecasted to occur largely happened on schedule with some resulting pull-through cleaning and repair work. Operating margin was 4.3% for the first quarter of 2022. U.K. Building Services operating income of $10.6 million or 8.1% of revenues represents an increase of $1.2 million and a 70 basis point improvement in operating margin period-over-period. This improvement was primarily from a favorable project closeout within the quarter, coupled with continued strength in the commercial market sector, inclusive of various telecommunications projects. We are now on Slide 9. Additional financial items of significance for the quarter not addressed in the previous slides are as follows: Quarter 1 gross profit of $352.6 million is higher than the comparable prior year quarter by $11.5 million or 3.4%. However, gross margin of 13.6% is lower than the 14.8% in last year's first quarter, which set new first quarter records for both gross profit and gross margin. Needless to say, with our growth in revenues during the quarter, we did eclipse 2021's first quarter gross profit and we established a new quarter 1 gross profit record. However, for the reasons covered in my segment operating income discussion, we are reporting a reduction in quarterly gross margin. Diluted earnings per common share in the first quarter was $1.39 as compared to $1.54 per diluted share for the prior year period, despite the quarter-over-quarter reduction in EPS, the first quarter of 2022 represents our second best earnings per share performance in a first quarter. Although we experienced an approximately 13% decline in quarter-over-quarter reported net income, our reduction in outstanding shares through our share repurchase program softened the earnings per share impact of such net income decrease. We are now on Slide 10. EMCOR's balance sheet maintains its strength in liquidity. Cash on hand of over $500 million has decreased by $306.8 million from year-end 2021 and primarily as a result of cash used for financing activities of $193.5 million, inclusive of approximately $182 million of common stock repurchases made by us through March 31. In addition, we utilized $95.8 million of operating cash during the quarter, partially as a result of our strong organic revenue growth during the period. Additionally, as has historically been the case, our working capital needs tend to be greater in the first quarter of each year, partially due to our funding of prior year's incentive awards. Despite this use of cash during the first quarter, we anticipate the generation of positive operating cash flow as the year progresses. Working capital has decreased by just over $109 million, largely as a result of the decrease in cash just referenced which was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable, given the revenue growth during the period and a decrease in accrued payroll and benefits due to the incentive payments made during the quarter that I previously mentioned. Goodwill remains relatively consistent with that as of December 2021. Net identifiable intangible assets have decreased by nearly $15 million during 2022 as amortization expense taken more than offset the additional intangible assets recognized in connection with the acquisition we completed in Q1. Total debt, exclusive of operating lease liabilities remains nearly identical to that as of December, and EMCOR's debt to capitalization ratio has increased modestly from 10.4% at year-end 2021 to 10.9% at March 31, 2022, given the reduction in our shareholders' equity resulting from our share repurchase activity during the first quarter. As we stated before, our balance sheet in conjunction with the borrowing capacity available to us under our credit agreement will continue to enable us to invest in our business, return capital to shareholders and execute against our strategic objectives as we progress through 2022 and future periods. We remain committed to our capital allocation strategy as evidenced by both our share repurchase activity to date as well as today's announcement that our Board of Directors has increased the authorization under our share repurchase program. With my portion of this morning's slide presentation complete, I will now return the call to Tony. Tony?\nAnthony Guzzi : Thanks, Mark, and we'll see you when we do questions. I'm going to be on Page 11, remaining performance obligations by segment and market sector. The first quarter was another strong bookings quarter for the company. As many of you know, our business is not a quarter-to-quarter business. However, total company RPOs nonetheless have increased sequentially in 8 out of the last 9 quarters despite being selective in bidding activities given the uneven economic environment. As mentioned earlier, total company RPOs at the end of the first quarter were $5.95 billion, up almost $1.2 billion or close to 25% over the March '21 total of $4.78 billion. First quarter project bookings revenues by RPOs increasing $354 million from December 2021. In fact, each of our segments grew RPOs in the first quarter from year-end 2021. The organic RPO growth, as I stated earlier, was a very strong 21%. The first quarter saw a strong year-over-year quarterly RPO and revenue growth. Simply stated, this is the one-two punch highlights both the current and future top core demand in our business. We continue to see an active bidding environment even during this time of supply chain disruptions and inflation challenges. Together, our 2 domestic construction segments experienced strong construction project growth in the quarter and RPOs increased by $865 million or 22.7% from March 2021. The Mechanical Construction segments saw RPOs increase by $745 million or 28%, while the Electrical Construction segment saw an increase of $121 million or a solid 10%. U.S. Building Services RPO levels increased $306 million or almost 45% from the year ago quarter. All 3 business divisions under U.S. Building Services, our commercial site-based services, government services and mobile mechanical services saw RPO increases from the year ago quarter with mobile mechanical services RPOs increasing $272 million. We continue to see significant opportunities to improve building wellness in the institutional and educational sectors. Moving to the right side of the page, we saw RPOs broken down by market sector. We continue to see balanced year-over-year RPO growth in every sector, except in the transportation sector. Continuing a trend we saw throughout 2021 RPO growth was broad-based in the first quarter across most market sectors with commercial RPOs, including hyperscale data centers and high-tech semiconductor projects increasing 28% year-over-year. Our commercial RPOs total increased $582 million year-over-year and now stands at $2.7 billion, making up 45% of our total company RPOs. Finishing up on our RPO year-over-year growth, health care RPOs are up nice, institutional are up, industrial manufacturing are up and water and wastewater up as well as short duration projects. From both a business segment and market perspective, I continue to like the balance and breadth of our RPOs. I'm going to switch to Page 12 because we have used this slide to talk about the underpinnings of our business. Look, I look at this slide, and this is the table that gets set for us to execute on. And really, we're growing in every one of these areas I previously described. And we're all well positioned in these growing nonresidential markets and trades. The data center market is still very strong, and we're positioned well in the major data center geographic markets as well as type of data centers and as well as with the right customers. Although we did see project delivery slowing down almost entirely related to supply chain, that even makes the demand stronger and the need for our services stronger that eventually, the data center is going to have to come online faster. We're seeing that across our trades, electrical, mechanical and fire protection, and we're seeing it across the regions where we are very strong. And we're very strong in this business because we have the best labor in the market to do this business. We execute very well with the trades that we have, and we have excellent prefabrication capabilities that we are looking to grow across all 3 trades to support this growth. Mark talked about the fire protection growth that we've had supporting the e-commerce buildup. Again, we see no slowing of that fire protection demand. And I'm going to segue into the industrial manufacturing, where we also see strong fire protection demand, especially as it relates to 2 major trends. The build-out of the semiconductor plants, which we are well positioned, both fire protection-wise, mechanically and low voltage wise on our electrical trade and also with respect to fire protection. Again, we are in most of the right markets to execute these trades, and we are really busy doing that work and planning that work. Some of that work is being delayed a little bit or the project delivery is being delayed, we're actually working on the sites because of some of the uncertainty with respect to stainless steel right now. But this is a good long-term market. The other good long-term markets that are very good with respect to industrial manufacturing, as always, is food processing, where we serve as an EPC or CM in many cases, but also beyond that, the reshoring of manufacturing, we see this as a long-term trend, especially with respect you see as the growing competition with China and all the political uncertainty there. But also people are realizing now with the Omicron, it is not a dependable source of supply. We're also seeing industrial manufacturing growth as it does with respect to growth to support electric vehicles and the build-out of not only charging stations, but the build-out of manufacturing plants to support people that are now building electric vehicles. And we are well positioned, both mechanically, electrically as well as fire protection to do that work. Health care continues to be a strong market for us. Health care can be a little episodic. We do see people seeking more flexibility with respect to their health care flexibility and their facility flexibility post COVID, both in a rehab mode, what I mean by rehabbing the building, but also with respect to new construction. Water and Wastewater is another strong market for us, especially in Florida. And of course, now you take those next to, they're intertwined across our business, across all market sectors. We're seeing very strong demand for mechanical services. We wish we were getting more delivery equipment to put it in, but when we can't, we fix it. And indoor air quality. These projects have all become melded together. You heard me talk about individual air quality projects. That's no longer what's happening. It gets presented as an overall mechanical retrofit package that drives down energy cost, but also brings in enhanced air quality into the building. Now this has been a transition point for many owners as outside air was previously considered not a great thing to bring into the building. But now you have to balance the introduction of outside air versus energy efficiency, which then leads to equipment replacement. And eventually, all this will get squared away. And we'll have very strong replacement markets as we do now. And I do think that's going to continue for a while. And of course, our fire protection, we are the leading sprinkler construction contractor on a nationwide basis, and we have one heck of a service offering to do there, both on fire alarming and fire protection led by a great team out of 2 of our subsidiaries in the Midwest that work nationwide, both of them. Now -- so if you look at those trends and you think about the revenue growth, if you look at our RPO growth, we have a pretty good table set for the long term here at EMCOR. We had some bumps in the first quarter, not totally unexpected, if you think about everything we had to contend with. Are we pleased with our suppliers right now? Absolutely not. Is some of it their fault? No. I mean they're having the same challenges as many people have. And we can talk more in the Q&A about some of the challenges they have. So we looked at that and we said, you go to Page 13 and 14. We came out with initial guidance at $10.4 billion to $10.7 billion of revenues and $715 million to $785 million in earnings per diluted share. We as a team see no reason to change that based upon our Q1 results. When we set our guidance, we expected the nonresidential market to grow in the low to mid-single digits. We did expect more normalized demand from our refining and petrochemical customers, and we did expect a continued resumption in small project and service activity. You know what? The reality of all of these have proven to be true so far this year. As with prior years, and I think what you're going to hear is actually a repeat of what I said in the first quarter with some updates on it. Where you move in that guidance range depends a lot on things that we think are in our control and things that are less in our control. I don't think there's any doubt to anybody that's followed EMCOR over a long period of time that we know our costs, and we know how to control our costs. It's something we're really good at. I think we're as good as anybody in our industries. However, we do expect continuing headwinds from fuel cost and supply chain issues, both of which, as you go through the first quarter, in that first quarter, proved to be worse than we expected coming out of the year-end 2021. A lot of reasons for that, right? We talked about those. We're not going to go ad nauseam about Ukraine and Omicron and how that will impact the supply chain, I mean it was already a challenged supply chain. But you know what, we got the best team. Our folks in the field know how to adapt and overcome as does their segment leadership. And the challenges are there. They know how to work through them. We'll continue to refine our process to mitigate these headwinds as best we can. And of course, we will be very aggressive seeking entitlement where it's available on our projects for changes. We're going to continue to be disciplined in our estimating pricing. As significant as our RPO growth has been for the year with a book-to-bill of over 1.1. We actually could have booked more work with a little less discipline, but we remain very disciplined because we continue to see good opportunities in all the things I talked about on Page 12. And we're winning work in all the right places. And the table has been set. We just got to continue to execute and get through some of the issues we've had here in the first quarter. We're never going to sacrifice safety at all levels of our organization. And underlying where we end up in the guidance range is we expect, as Mark said, a normal operating environment through the year for our Industrial Services business. And sitting here today, we expect to have a normal fall turnaround season. But like in anything, there's a lot of things you don't completely control. As much as I'd like to and as much as our EMCOR team would love to, we don't control what happens in the supply chain to any significant way, especially as you go upstream. We faced a tough supply chain in Q1, and we expect it to remain a challenge in the second quarter. This challenge specifically centers around major systems like applied HVAC, large electrical gear, panels, pumps and generators, things like that, things that are more system related. And why is that even more challenged than the pipe in the commodities, in the wire and the conduit? Because each of them are smart pieces of equipment and all of them have chips. And this is when the -- this has been the biggest issue with on-time delivery and complete delivery. Will COVID have another resurgence even beyond what we experienced in the first quarter? Look, none of us really have any idea of that. But what we do know is we will keep our employees as safe as possible, and we will keep our projects moving and our services will be delivered. One of the questions we get is, will customer decision-making slow with all the uncertainties? Quite frankly, we have not seen customer decision-making slow, especially go back to Page 12 on all the areas where we really are excelling right now. But we have seen some projects delivery slowed, not even delayed, they slowed delivery as a result of supply chain issues around a major OEM systems that we talked about. Will the Fed's announced an expected increase in interest rates slow down our customers' decision-making with respect to large capital projects? We have seen no impact to date. Again, go back to the kind of areas we're really growing in. Most of those customers are flushed with cash. What will happen with inflation? I could give you an answer and say, you tell me. But to date, we have -- it is worse and not better than at the end of 2021. As we move further into 2022, we will continue to be disciplined capital allocators in terms of our organic investments, acquisitions and the return of cash to shareholders, all of which we believe are important uses of our capital. Year-to-date, we have purchased over 250 million in shares through April 28, 2022. As announced this morning, our Board has approved an increase of over $200 million under our share repurchase plan. And we continue to be active in the acquisition space, and we are funding our significant organic growth. As always, I'd like to thank you for your interest in EMCOR. I'll take questions and Grace, you can open the line.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Sean Eastman from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nSean Eastman : Tony, first one, when you talk about being very disciplined on new bookings, what exactly does that mean? Is that just pricing like really nailing down the pricing? Or is it picking jobs where you think you have the supply chain on lock? Explain that to me on how you're approaching new work.\nAnthony Guzzi : So it's part of the thing you talked. So let's think about what goes into an estimate and where you need to be disciplined. So in a normal environment, right, supply chain is really not that much of a variable, right? Because we have great relationships with our suppliers. We know how to scope and descope. We don't miss scope very often. And so we can get pricing right, we can lock it in. In this environment, disciplined means you look -- you make sure that on your key components, that you really understand what delivery could look like. And then you benchmark that delivery versus what -- you benchmark what they've been telling you versus what they've actually been doing. So it's no longer just saying, \"Hey, you told me it would be this ridiculous 36 weeks. The last 3 times, you actually delivered it in 42 weeks\". So when we make our estimate, we -- we're not telling everybody else, but we're making an estimate closer to the 42 weeks, and then we're going to do our resource planning around that. You also try to lock in all the commodities that you can, and you actually let the purchase order. Where you were in a noninflationary environment, you're not as worried about that. You actually let the purchase order and you get the supplier to commit, and you have to be disciplined to hit those windows. Typically, before a supplier would let their price out there for 30 to 60 days, sometimes now it's as quick as 7 or 8 days, and you have to be very on top of the process to make sure you're locking in that quote for that job if you get it. The other things you have to take a really hard look at your customers that you're going to work for. And for us, that's multiple places in the channel. Who's the owner that ultimately is going to own this project, if we're not working directly for the owner. Who's the general contractor and construction manager and what their team looks like. If the owner is purchasing the equipment, do we have clear line of sight on that equipment, and do we have the lines of communication open to make sure that, that owner is going to have the equipment delivered. Do they have a good track record of delivering? So our information management and our experiential data is more important than ever around the pricing of that product. And then it's about labor availability, something we don't really have a lot of issues with. Like when project is live, like we had some very good data center projects move in the first quarter to the second quarter and beyond. Again, we're doing work there, but then we have to sequence our work to make sure that we can have the right resources at the right time. Because what we really worry about first is can we get the right labor with the right skills at the right place at the right time to deliver the project. And you put all that together, that's how you price your project. And you got to do -- again, you can't just take things that are quoted to you, you have to recheck against what people have been doing in their recent history. On a small project, it's a little different. It's become very different. Typically, a small project being $200,000 to $300,000, that a lot of times will be executed in a quarter. But with extended lead times, now you got to say, okay, customer, you want this done, you actually need to have this done. However, the window you planned on us doing, it looks a little different because here's what supply looks like right now. And that supply is different than what it was going to be than you're used to us doing this replacement project. Therefore, this is how we have to price it. So that's how you think about project large and small. Then you get into brake fix work, which is the repair service that Mark talked about, which is actually we expect to continue to grow through the year. There, you have to be really on top of what the variables going in, we know labor. We know labor cost. But this fuel spike, and we've seen it over the last year, we were very good at catching up. But just to give you a backdrop of how things are different, Sean, I mean, I've been doing this a long time, all the way back to when I was a carrier with HVAC technicians. You typically would reset your standards right before summer, right? Because that was your busiest time of year from June till September. And so you would reset standards in. Last year, we had reset them almost 3x, and I say, almost, because some of the northern cities we didn't have to do as much because they're not as busy towards the end of the year. And then this year, we've already reset them twice. And our customers have accepted it. They know what's going on in the world. But in that, you're always behind, right? You can't charge customers for something that hasn't happened yet. But they also know there will be a month late taking it off because they understand of what happened upfront. And of course, it helps to have very skilled technicians when you do that because when you have those very skilled technicians, people want them to be able to do their work. And so it all works together. So yes, pricing has gotten more complex, but it's mostly got more complex on really not having the same level of trust in the supply chain for people to execute what they said they were going to execute.\nSean Eastman : Okay. Got it. And this one is a little more granular. So if I look at the midpoint of the earnings guidance for the full year, it implies that the first quarter will be a lower proportion of that full year outlook than we've seen over the past few years. Can you just help me get comfortable with sort of that implied catch-up there? I can think of a few things that would make that make sense. But I just wanted to kind of give you guys the floor on that element.\nAnthony Guzzi : Yes. And I'll kick it over to Mark. Well, the biggest variable, as you look at the back half of the year, that hasn't happened in '20 and '21 is we expect EIS to be profitable in the back half of the year. I mean that's the biggest variable. So that's one of the ways you catch up. The other one is if you go to the midpoint, there's an obvious just math exercise, we have less outstanding shares, right? So as a result of that, the math works. We also believe that our project timing and execution is back half weighted this year. We sort of knew that going into the year because of the scheduling of some of our larger projects and nothing's changed along those lines. Mark?\nMark Pompa : Yes, Sean, the only thing I would add to Tony's comment is we're presuming that revenue is going to continue to grow at the levels it did in the first quarter and presuming we're going to get some incremental improvement in margin contribution, which clearly we believe that or otherwise we would have changed guidance. It's going to be disproportionate, right? I mean I think the problem with the quarter that we're announcing today or that we announced today is that we didn't get the same level of pull-through from the revenue activity for all the reasons that were discussed prior to your question. We've done everything we can to make sure that for the things that I would define as self-inflicted are not going to recur in quarters 2, 3 or 4. If we get the external environment to stabilize at this point, we're comfortable with how it's going to shake out.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Noelle Dilts from Stifel.\nNoelle Dilts: My first question is pretty specific. But you mentioned the delay in telecommunications projects. Can you expand on that at all? Is it wireless, wireline, how should we think about that?\nAnthony Guzzi : That is data centers for us.\nNoelle Dilts : Data centers, okay. I just wanted to make sure I got that think right. Okay. Perfect. And then second, you hear me almost every quarter ask about M&A and how you're thinking about the valuations in the market. I would think that multiples have come down a bit. So could you comment just on how you're thinking about potentially getting more active on the M&A front and just what you're kind of seeing in the market in terms of opportunity?\nAnthony Guzzi : Yes. I mean we have a pretty good pipeline. I mean, we've made a couple of deals in the first quarter that we were tuck-in that we expect actually to feel really good because it gives us a labor force in markets that we want to grow. But what we're not going to do is inherent somebody else's problems. And it doesn't mean they're bad companies. It means the trends we saw in the first quarter in our business, they have in spades because they don't have this level of process control and sophistication we have or connection in the supply chain. Where we can get comfortable or where we think we can help that acquisition close that gap, we'll make it. But we think there's a gap in their execution, in their projects around those issues we will probably take a pause. That being said, we're active acquirers. We expect to continue to do deals like we have through our history and broadly defined it would be in any of our segments. A little less so in EIS because we think we have the platform we need, especially on the oil and gas side, we would make the right renewable or sustainable energy acquisition there. We have a capability there that we would like to grow. But other than that, I mean, it's business as usual. We feel good. People want to be owned by EMCOR, and we want to buy them.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer from Thompson Davis.\nAdam Thalhimer : What did you say about the timing of project closeouts? I think you said there were some that got pushed from kind of late in Q1?\nAnthony Guzzi : Yes. So we typically, right, last year, we had a very good closeout portion in Q1 of last year, and we said that, right? I mean that was something we said on our first quarter call last year. We had less of that happening mainly around supply chain issues, right? We need materials to come to us to finish the job so that we then can commission the job and get off the job. Because of the slowdown in the missed deliveries and the incomplete shipments, we had more of an issue with that in the first quarter. Here's what I think is going to happen, right? A lot of these issues, we talked about it in the first quarter last year that we saw it coming. It really started to hit with lead times, especially mid-third quarter '21. We net -- we've adjusted those lead times. We should start seeing a lot of that equipment come in here and those missed deliveries start to catch up here, May, June, July, August. Mark, do you have anything to add there?\nMark Pompa : Yes. I think Adam, once again, we don't control the timeline of our customers' projects. And when we entered into 2022, we definitely had different sequencing, especially in the data center space. So even with the delays that both Tony and I have mentioned during the call today, the way that the RPOs were going to burn through revenue was actually more late 2022 weighted than 2021. So when you look at our -- if you reflect back on 2021, our margin performance was actually stronger through the first 6 months than it was in the last 6 months of the year. And that was once again just because of the mix of work. That phenomenon is going to exist in 2022 as anticipated, except that it's the inverse. It's more back half of the year than first half of the year. So putting aside the supply chain discussions that we have had...\nAnthony Guzzi : It can happen anywhere.\nMark Pompa : Yes, the work is scheduled to happen later in the year. A couple of things that happened relative to the first quarter it certainly does not change the quantum of the year, but certainly did impact the first quarter.\nAnthony Guzzi : We don't give quarterly guidance for a reason. But clearly, we anticipated would have some challenges around it just from project sequencing and timing. Regardless, I mean we could have a great supply chain right now, we would have some of those issues. They were a little more pronounced because of the supply chain and we're like whistling past that. Omicron was a big deal for us in the first quarter. I mean there are parts of our company that had 20% of their workforce out on large jobs. That's a big deal. I mean -- and we got through it. It was tough and we will solder on.\nAdam Thalhimer : Okay. And then, Tony, if you look at your large projects or EPC jobs, what stage are you in, generally, if you look at that whole portfolio?\nAnthony Guzzi : Well, I think Mark talked about that. I mean that's part of what we talked about project sequencing and timing on '22. We knew that some of our larger jobs would be starting up in late '21. That's part of what you saw in late '21 as part of what you would have seen in the first quarter, even absent Omicron or supply chain. Some of that's been shifted a month maybe as we wait for the sequence we're not fullest once, right? We're a little more reticent about how these jobs will start up. And so it may have moved things 30, 45 days to get to full ramp. But the stages are they're much earlier in their stages than they were in the first part of '21.\nAdam Thalhimer : Okay. And then just lastly, I'm trying to parse through your industrial commentary, are you -- I mean, vis-a-vis 3 months ago, are you -- it sounds like you're maybe a little less confident on the refinery outlook this year?\nAnthony Guzzi : No, I didn't want you to read into that. I'm always -- look, if you've gone through what we went through over the last 21 months, you're going to be a little cautious, right? Demand is strong, customers are healthy...\nMark Pompa : Refinery utilizations are high.\nAnthony Guzzi : Refinery utilizations are high. I mean, crack spreads are good despite the price. Our customers are healthy. They're talking to us about all the right things. We're helping them with some of their biggest needs even outside of just turnarounds. What makes me cautious is just to be cautious with the customer base. And the other thing that makes me cautious is they get a lot of pressure to keep running, right, because we need to supply in the market. But we've heard nothing that makes us less than confident what's going on in that space this year. Is that it?\nBrad Newman: Grace, is there anybody else?\nAnthony Guzzi : All right. Look, thank you all. Thanks for your time. Thanks for the thoughtful questions. We're going to work real hard to continue to produce. Like most things, we will get through this, too. And we will figure out how to manage the supply chain, and we will make it work. Thank you all very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Anthony Guzzi",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Kevin. And I'm going to be on Pages 4 to 6 to start, and I'd like to thank all of you for joining us this morning. On our February 24, year-end call, I described the current operating environment that we experienced in the first quarter as one of the toughest that I had seen in my career. This remained the case through the first quarter of 2022. However, at EMCOR, we do have a no excuses culture. We have to adapt to an ever-changing operating environment. We are executing with discipline and flexibility as we navigate this challenging environment. Overall, the quarter went about as expected for us, with a little more pressure on operating income margins in our Domestic Construction and Building Services segments due to the disruptions caused by supply chain issues and the Omicron variant. Further, the Ukraine war added another layer of uncertainty, especially with respect to energy and some raw material costs. We will cover the supply chain issues later in both mine and Mark's comments. In the quarter, we earned revenues of $2.59 billion, operating income of $100 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.39. We had very strong organic revenue growth of 10.8% in the aggregate across our domestic segments with our Industrial segment leading the way at 32%. Our project pipeline remains strong with a good mix of projects. We saw an increase of RPOs to a record $5.95 billion versus $4.78 billion in the year ago period. Our combined operating income margins were 3.9% as we fought through increased fuel costs and difficult supply chains in the quarter that disrupted many projects and prevented us from achieving our expected labor productivity. As we evaluate the quarter, I thought I would cover the business more broadly versus on a segment-by-segment basis as many of these trends, both positive and negative and challenges, cut across our entire business. First, let me cover what I think is going well. Our end markets continue to be resilient, and we are winning work in the right places at the right prices. Again, we are winning work at the -- in the right places at the right prices. As I just mentioned, we grew RPOs 25% in the aggregate and 21% organically versus the year ago period. I will cover that in more detail when I review RPOs after Mark's commentary. Our Industrial Services segment is performing as expected and had a heck of a rebound to a more normal operating environment not seen since 2019. We are proving our resilience every day as we execute and complete work under what are difficult operating conditions. The disruption caused by the Omicron variants are dissipated as we exited Q1. Hopefully, such disruptions caused by COVID are behind us. We are having significant success in attracting the right mix of skilled craft labor to execute our work. We kept our field leadership and labor intact. In the short run, there was a cost to us as the issues we experienced in the quarter affected labor productivity. However, we made that decision that with our high-level RPOs and the current bidding environment, we should not reduce our key labor resources, especially our field leadership, such as our foremen. We are proactively managing our pricing and believe that we have caught up with customer pricing in our Building Services segment with respect to fuel and MRO, that is maintenance, repair and other type material charges as we exit the quarter. Our team is very good at adapting and developing contingency plans with respect to our supply chain. We've had to find work around as supply chain has become more volatile with respect to on-time delivery and delivering a complete order. But that's what we're good at, finding solutions for difficult circumstances, and we will continue to adapt as needed. What has proven to be more challenging than we had contemplated in early 2022 are the following: The continued rise in energy prices, especially for gasoline and diesel leads to margin compression, and that's most notably within Building Services but even more broadly as it impacts our project pricing as we develop overhead rates. Despite the continued energy price inflation, we believe that we have, for the most part, appropriately adjusted our pricing models to reflect these costs. Supply chain challenges were worse than we expected, and it's been in a difficult supply chain and it became even more challenging due to the impact of the Omicron surge and the conflict in Ukraine had on our suppliers. The Ukraine conflict has impacted not only the price of gasoline and natural gas and diesel. It has also impacted the price and availability of certain metals like nickel, which is a key component of stainless steel and pig iron, which is a key component of cast-iron pipe. While we understand how to price and contract our work in an environment of increasing lead times and prices, we also encountered missed deliveries and incomplete shipments during the quarter. These disruptions resulted in reduced labor efficiency on certain of our projects. Such supply chain disruptions and the Omicron surge at the start of the quarter resulted in some very good project work being delayed and also prevented us from being able to close out some very successful projects. As I turn the commentary to Mark, I remain confident in our segment and subsidiary leadership and our team skills and resourcefulness to mitigate these challenges and build on our strengths as we move forward in 2022. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark. Thanks, Mark, and we'll see you when we do questions. I'm going to be on Page 11, remaining performance obligations by segment and market sector. The first quarter was another strong bookings quarter for the company. As many of you know, our business is not a quarter-to-quarter business. However, total company RPOs nonetheless have increased sequentially in 8 out of the last 9 quarters despite being selective in bidding activities given the uneven economic environment. As mentioned earlier, total company RPOs at the end of the first quarter were $5.95 billion, up almost $1.2 billion or close to 25% over the March '21 total of $4.78 billion. First quarter project bookings revenues by RPOs increasing $354 million from December 2021. In fact, each of our segments grew RPOs in the first quarter from year-end 2021. The organic RPO growth, as I stated earlier, was a very strong 21%. The first quarter saw a strong year-over-year quarterly RPO and revenue growth. Simply stated, this is the one-two punch highlights both the current and future top core demand in our business. We continue to see an active bidding environment even during this time of supply chain disruptions and inflation challenges. Together, our 2 domestic construction segments experienced strong construction project growth in the quarter and RPOs increased by $865 million or 22.7% from March 2021. The Mechanical Construction segments saw RPOs increase by $745 million or 28%, while the Electrical Construction segment saw an increase of $121 million or a solid 10%. U.S. Building Services RPO levels increased $306 million or almost 45% from the year ago quarter. All 3 business divisions under U.S. Building Services, our commercial site-based services, government services and mobile mechanical services saw RPO increases from the year ago quarter with mobile mechanical services RPOs increasing $272 million. We continue to see significant opportunities to improve building wellness in the institutional and educational sectors. Moving to the right side of the page, we saw RPOs broken down by market sector. We continue to see balanced year-over-year RPO growth in every sector, except in the transportation sector. Continuing a trend we saw throughout 2021 RPO growth was broad-based in the first quarter across most market sectors with commercial RPOs, including hyperscale data centers and high-tech semiconductor projects increasing 28% year-over-year. Our commercial RPOs total increased $582 million year-over-year and now stands at $2.7 billion, making up 45% of our total company RPOs. Finishing up on our RPO year-over-year growth, health care RPOs are up nice, institutional are up, industrial manufacturing are up and water and wastewater up as well as short duration projects. From both a business segment and market perspective, I continue to like the balance and breadth of our RPOs. I'm going to switch to Page 12 because we have used this slide to talk about the underpinnings of our business. Look, I look at this slide, and this is the table that gets set for us to execute on. And really, we're growing in every one of these areas I previously described. And we're all well positioned in these growing nonresidential markets and trades. The data center market is still very strong, and we're positioned well in the major data center geographic markets as well as type of data centers and as well as with the right customers. Although we did see project delivery slowing down almost entirely related to supply chain, that even makes the demand stronger and the need for our services stronger that eventually, the data center is going to have to come online faster. We're seeing that across our trades, electrical, mechanical and fire protection, and we're seeing it across the regions where we are very strong. And we're very strong in this business because we have the best labor in the market to do this business. We execute very well with the trades that we have, and we have excellent prefabrication capabilities that we are looking to grow across all 3 trades to support this growth. Mark talked about the fire protection growth that we've had supporting the e-commerce buildup. Again, we see no slowing of that fire protection demand. And I'm going to segue into the industrial manufacturing, where we also see strong fire protection demand, especially as it relates to 2 major trends. The build-out of the semiconductor plants, which we are well positioned, both fire protection-wise, mechanically and low voltage wise on our electrical trade and also with respect to fire protection. Again, we are in most of the right markets to execute these trades, and we are really busy doing that work and planning that work. Some of that work is being delayed a little bit or the project delivery is being delayed, we're actually working on the sites because of some of the uncertainty with respect to stainless steel right now. But this is a good long-term market. The other good long-term markets that are very good with respect to industrial manufacturing, as always, is food processing, where we serve as an EPC or CM in many cases, but also beyond that, the reshoring of manufacturing, we see this as a long-term trend, especially with respect you see as the growing competition with China and all the political uncertainty there. But also people are realizing now with the Omicron, it is not a dependable source of supply. We're also seeing industrial manufacturing growth as it does with respect to growth to support electric vehicles and the build-out of not only charging stations, but the build-out of manufacturing plants to support people that are now building electric vehicles. And we are well positioned, both mechanically, electrically as well as fire protection to do that work. Health care continues to be a strong market for us. Health care can be a little episodic. We do see people seeking more flexibility with respect to their health care flexibility and their facility flexibility post COVID, both in a rehab mode, what I mean by rehabbing the building, but also with respect to new construction. Water and Wastewater is another strong market for us, especially in Florida. And of course, now you take those next to, they're intertwined across our business, across all market sectors. We're seeing very strong demand for mechanical services. We wish we were getting more delivery equipment to put it in, but when we can't, we fix it. And indoor air quality. These projects have all become melded together. You heard me talk about individual air quality projects. That's no longer what's happening. It gets presented as an overall mechanical retrofit package that drives down energy cost, but also brings in enhanced air quality into the building. Now this has been a transition point for many owners as outside air was previously considered not a great thing to bring into the building. But now you have to balance the introduction of outside air versus energy efficiency, which then leads to equipment replacement. And eventually, all this will get squared away. And we'll have very strong replacement markets as we do now. And I do think that's going to continue for a while. And of course, our fire protection, we are the leading sprinkler construction contractor on a nationwide basis, and we have one heck of a service offering to do there, both on fire alarming and fire protection led by a great team out of 2 of our subsidiaries in the Midwest that work nationwide, both of them. Now -- so if you look at those trends and you think about the revenue growth, if you look at our RPO growth, we have a pretty good table set for the long term here at EMCOR. We had some bumps in the first quarter, not totally unexpected, if you think about everything we had to contend with. Are we pleased with our suppliers right now? Absolutely not. Is some of it their fault? No. I mean they're having the same challenges as many people have. And we can talk more in the Q&A about some of the challenges they have. So we looked at that and we said, you go to Page 13 and 14. We came out with initial guidance at $10.4 billion to $10.7 billion of revenues and $715 million to $785 million in earnings per diluted share. We as a team see no reason to change that based upon our Q1 results. When we set our guidance, we expected the nonresidential market to grow in the low to mid-single digits. We did expect more normalized demand from our refining and petrochemical customers, and we did expect a continued resumption in small project and service activity. You know what? The reality of all of these have proven to be true so far this year. As with prior years, and I think what you're going to hear is actually a repeat of what I said in the first quarter with some updates on it. Where you move in that guidance range depends a lot on things that we think are in our control and things that are less in our control. I don't think there's any doubt to anybody that's followed EMCOR over a long period of time that we know our costs, and we know how to control our costs. It's something we're really good at. I think we're as good as anybody in our industries. However, we do expect continuing headwinds from fuel cost and supply chain issues, both of which, as you go through the first quarter, in that first quarter, proved to be worse than we expected coming out of the year-end 2021. A lot of reasons for that, right? We talked about those. We're not going to go ad nauseam about Ukraine and Omicron and how that will impact the supply chain, I mean it was already a challenged supply chain. But you know what, we got the best team. Our folks in the field know how to adapt and overcome as does their segment leadership. And the challenges are there. They know how to work through them. We'll continue to refine our process to mitigate these headwinds as best we can. And of course, we will be very aggressive seeking entitlement where it's available on our projects for changes. We're going to continue to be disciplined in our estimating pricing. As significant as our RPO growth has been for the year with a book-to-bill of over 1.1. We actually could have booked more work with a little less discipline, but we remain very disciplined because we continue to see good opportunities in all the things I talked about on Page 12. And we're winning work in all the right places. And the table has been set. We just got to continue to execute and get through some of the issues we've had here in the first quarter. We're never going to sacrifice safety at all levels of our organization. And underlying where we end up in the guidance range is we expect, as Mark said, a normal operating environment through the year for our Industrial Services business. And sitting here today, we expect to have a normal fall turnaround season. But like in anything, there's a lot of things you don't completely control. As much as I'd like to and as much as our EMCOR team would love to, we don't control what happens in the supply chain to any significant way, especially as you go upstream. We faced a tough supply chain in Q1, and we expect it to remain a challenge in the second quarter. This challenge specifically centers around major systems like applied HVAC, large electrical gear, panels, pumps and generators, things like that, things that are more system related. And why is that even more challenged than the pipe in the commodities, in the wire and the conduit? Because each of them are smart pieces of equipment and all of them have chips. And this is when the -- this has been the biggest issue with on-time delivery and complete delivery. Will COVID have another resurgence even beyond what we experienced in the first quarter? Look, none of us really have any idea of that. But what we do know is we will keep our employees as safe as possible, and we will keep our projects moving and our services will be delivered. One of the questions we get is, will customer decision-making slow with all the uncertainties? Quite frankly, we have not seen customer decision-making slow, especially go back to Page 12 on all the areas where we really are excelling right now. But we have seen some projects delivery slowed, not even delayed, they slowed delivery as a result of supply chain issues around a major OEM systems that we talked about. Will the Fed's announced an expected increase in interest rates slow down our customers' decision-making with respect to large capital projects? We have seen no impact to date. Again, go back to the kind of areas we're really growing in. Most of those customers are flushed with cash. What will happen with inflation? I could give you an answer and say, you tell me. But to date, we have -- it is worse and not better than at the end of 2021. As we move further into 2022, we will continue to be disciplined capital allocators in terms of our organic investments, acquisitions and the return of cash to shareholders, all of which we believe are important uses of our capital. Year-to-date, we have purchased over 250 million in shares through April 28, 2022. As announced this morning, our Board has approved an increase of over $200 million under our share repurchase plan. And we continue to be active in the acquisition space, and we are funding our significant organic growth. As always, I'd like to thank you for your interest in EMCOR. I'll take questions and Grace, you can open the line. So it's part of the thing you talked. So let's think about what goes into an estimate and where you need to be disciplined. So in a normal environment, right, supply chain is really not that much of a variable, right? Because we have great relationships with our suppliers. We know how to scope and descope. We don't miss scope very often. And so we can get pricing right, we can lock it in. In this environment, disciplined means you look -- you make sure that on your key components, that you really understand what delivery could look like. And then you benchmark that delivery versus what -- you benchmark what they've been telling you versus what they've actually been doing. So it's no longer just saying, \"Hey, you told me it would be this ridiculous 36 weeks. The last 3 times, you actually delivered it in 42 weeks\". So when we make our estimate, we -- we're not telling everybody else, but we're making an estimate closer to the 42 weeks, and then we're going to do our resource planning around that. You also try to lock in all the commodities that you can, and you actually let the purchase order. Where you were in a noninflationary environment, you're not as worried about that. You actually let the purchase order and you get the supplier to commit, and you have to be disciplined to hit those windows. Typically, before a supplier would let their price out there for 30 to 60 days, sometimes now it's as quick as 7 or 8 days, and you have to be very on top of the process to make sure you're locking in that quote for that job if you get it. The other things you have to take a really hard look at your customers that you're going to work for. And for us, that's multiple places in the channel. Who's the owner that ultimately is going to own this project, if we're not working directly for the owner. Who's the general contractor and construction manager and what their team looks like. If the owner is purchasing the equipment, do we have clear line of sight on that equipment, and do we have the lines of communication open to make sure that, that owner is going to have the equipment delivered. Do they have a good track record of delivering? So our information management and our experiential data is more important than ever around the pricing of that product. And then it's about labor availability, something we don't really have a lot of issues with. Like when project is live, like we had some very good data center projects move in the first quarter to the second quarter and beyond. Again, we're doing work there, but then we have to sequence our work to make sure that we can have the right resources at the right time. Because what we really worry about first is can we get the right labor with the right skills at the right place at the right time to deliver the project. And you put all that together, that's how you price your project. And you got to do -- again, you can't just take things that are quoted to you, you have to recheck against what people have been doing in their recent history. On a small project, it's a little different. It's become very different. Typically, a small project being $200,000 to $300,000, that a lot of times will be executed in a quarter. But with extended lead times, now you got to say, okay, customer, you want this done, you actually need to have this done. However, the window you planned on us doing, it looks a little different because here's what supply looks like right now. And that supply is different than what it was going to be than you're used to us doing this replacement project. Therefore, this is how we have to price it. So that's how you think about project large and small. Then you get into brake fix work, which is the repair service that Mark talked about, which is actually we expect to continue to grow through the year. There, you have to be really on top of what the variables going in, we know labor. We know labor cost. But this fuel spike, and we've seen it over the last year, we were very good at catching up. But just to give you a backdrop of how things are different, Sean, I mean, I've been doing this a long time, all the way back to when I was a carrier with HVAC technicians. You typically would reset your standards right before summer, right? Because that was your busiest time of year from June till September. And so you would reset standards in. Last year, we had reset them almost 3x, and I say, almost, because some of the northern cities we didn't have to do as much because they're not as busy towards the end of the year. And then this year, we've already reset them twice. And our customers have accepted it. They know what's going on in the world. But in that, you're always behind, right? You can't charge customers for something that hasn't happened yet. But they also know there will be a month late taking it off because they understand of what happened upfront. And of course, it helps to have very skilled technicians when you do that because when you have those very skilled technicians, people want them to be able to do their work. And so it all works together. So yes, pricing has gotten more complex, but it's mostly got more complex on really not having the same level of trust in the supply chain for people to execute what they said they were going to execute. Yes. And I'll kick it over to Mark. Well, the biggest variable, as you look at the back half of the year, that hasn't happened in '20 and '21 is we expect EIS to be profitable in the back half of the year. I mean that's the biggest variable. So that's one of the ways you catch up. The other one is if you go to the midpoint, there's an obvious just math exercise, we have less outstanding shares, right? So as a result of that, the math works. We also believe that our project timing and execution is back half weighted this year. We sort of knew that going into the year because of the scheduling of some of our larger projects and nothing's changed along those lines. Mark? That is data centers for us. Yes. I mean we have a pretty good pipeline. I mean, we've made a couple of deals in the first quarter that we were tuck-in that we expect actually to feel really good because it gives us a labor force in markets that we want to grow. But what we're not going to do is inherent somebody else's problems. And it doesn't mean they're bad companies. It means the trends we saw in the first quarter in our business, they have in spades because they don't have this level of process control and sophistication we have or connection in the supply chain. Where we can get comfortable or where we think we can help that acquisition close that gap, we'll make it. But we think there's a gap in their execution, in their projects around those issues we will probably take a pause. That being said, we're active acquirers. We expect to continue to do deals like we have through our history and broadly defined it would be in any of our segments. A little less so in EIS because we think we have the platform we need, especially on the oil and gas side, we would make the right renewable or sustainable energy acquisition there. We have a capability there that we would like to grow. But other than that, I mean, it's business as usual. We feel good. People want to be owned by EMCOR, and we want to buy them. Yes. So we typically, right, last year, we had a very good closeout portion in Q1 of last year, and we said that, right? I mean that was something we said on our first quarter call last year. We had less of that happening mainly around supply chain issues, right? We need materials to come to us to finish the job so that we then can commission the job and get off the job. Because of the slowdown in the missed deliveries and the incomplete shipments, we had more of an issue with that in the first quarter. Here's what I think is going to happen, right? A lot of these issues, we talked about it in the first quarter last year that we saw it coming. It really started to hit with lead times, especially mid-third quarter '21. We net -- we've adjusted those lead times. We should start seeing a lot of that equipment come in here and those missed deliveries start to catch up here, May, June, July, August. Mark, do you have anything to add there? It can happen anywhere. We don't give quarterly guidance for a reason. But clearly, we anticipated would have some challenges around it just from project sequencing and timing. Regardless, I mean we could have a great supply chain right now, we would have some of those issues. They were a little more pronounced because of the supply chain and we're like whistling past that. Omicron was a big deal for us in the first quarter. I mean there are parts of our company that had 20% of their workforce out on large jobs. That's a big deal. I mean -- and we got through it. It was tough and we will solder on. Well, I think Mark talked about that. I mean that's part of what we talked about project sequencing and timing on '22. We knew that some of our larger jobs would be starting up in late '21. That's part of what you saw in late '21 as part of what you would have seen in the first quarter, even absent Omicron or supply chain. Some of that's been shifted a month maybe as we wait for the sequence we're not fullest once, right? We're a little more reticent about how these jobs will start up. And so it may have moved things 30, 45 days to get to full ramp. But the stages are they're much earlier in their stages than they were in the first part of '21. No, I didn't want you to read into that. I'm always -- look, if you've gone through what we went through over the last 21 months, you're going to be a little cautious, right? Demand is strong, customers are healthy... Refinery utilizations are high. I mean, crack spreads are good despite the price. Our customers are healthy. They're talking to us about all the right things. We're helping them with some of their biggest needs even outside of just turnarounds. What makes me cautious is just to be cautious with the customer base. And the other thing that makes me cautious is they get a lot of pressure to keep running, right, because we need to supply in the market. But we've heard nothing that makes us less than confident what's going on in that space this year. Is that it? All right. Look, thank you all. Thanks for your time. Thanks for the thoughtful questions. We're going to work real hard to continue to produce. Like most things, we will get through this, too. And we will figure out how to manage the supply chain, and we will make it work. Thank you all very much."

            "name": "Mark Pompa",
            "content": "Thank you, Tony, and good morning to everyone participating on the call today. For those accessing this presentation via the webcast, we are now on Slide 7. Over the next several slides, I will augment Tony's opening commentary and review each of our reportable segment's first quarter operating performance as well as other key financial data derived from our consolidated financial statements included in both our earnings release announcement and Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this morning. So let's expand our review of EMCOR's first quarter performance. As Tony mentioned, consolidated revenues of $2.59 billion are up $288.5 million or 12.5% over quarter 1 2021. Our first quarter results include $49.5 million of revenues attributable to businesses acquired pertaining to the period of time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in last year's first quarter. Acquisition revenues positively impacted each of our United States Electrical Construction and United States Building Services segments. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired, first quarter consolidated revenues increased approximately $239 million or a strong 10.4% quarter-over-quarter. Before reviewing the operating results of our individual reporting segments, I would like to highlight that each of our segments had strong revenue growth in the quarter and that our consolidated revenues of $2.59 billion represent a new first quarter record that is only eclipsed by 2021's fourth quarter, which generated the highest quarterly revenue in our long history. Tony has previously commented on the challenging operating environment that existed during the quarter and continues to persist to some extent. So one might question why am I highlighting a first quarter revenue record in light of the fact that it did not equate to record operating income or diluted earnings per share performance? The simple answer is that our business performance and growth prospects remain strong, and we collectively should not lose sight of this despite the economic headwinds that are impacting us. We continue to generate strong organic revenue growth while simultaneously growing our remaining performance obligations in most of the market sectors that we serve. So although we have experienced some choppiness in our first quarter results due mostly to external factors, we have not eroded our strong foundation and currently believe we will meet our annual targets barring any worsening of the macroeconomic conditions. With that being said, I will now cover the results of each of our reportable segments during the quarter, starting with revenue. United States Electrical Construction quarter 1 revenues of $522 million increased $62.6 million or 13.6% from 2021's comparable quarter. Excluding incremental acquisition revenues of $34.9 million, this segment's grew -- this segment's revenues grew organically 6% quarter-over-quarter. Increased project activity within the commercial market sector, exclusive of the telecommunications submarket sector as well as growth in each of the manufacturing, health care and transportation market sectors were the primary contributors to this segment's quarterly revenue growth. Offsetting these increases was a decline in revenues from the telecommunications submarket sector due to the sequencing of projects in the current year as well as project delivery delays as our customers await the receipt of critical equipment due to supply chain disruptions. Both of these factors have resulted in the shift of project work to later in 2022. United States Mechanical Construction segment revenues of $1 billion increased $86 million or 9.4% from quarter 1 2021. Revenue growth during the quarter was derived from the majority of the market sectors we serve, with the water and wastewater, manufacturing and commercial market sector is experiencing the most significant period-over-period increases. Revenue growth within the manufacturing market sector was concentrated in large food processing projects, while the growth in commercial market sector revenues was driven by demand from certain customers within the semiconductor, biotech, life sciences and pharmaceutical industries. This increased activity augmented the continued demand for our fire protection services, particularly from those of our customers building out their e-commerce supply chains. Both our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments established new first quarter revenue records in 2022. United States Building Services segment revenues of $627.8 million increased $59.8 million or 10.5% and represents an all-time quarterly record for this segment. Excluding incremental acquisition contribution of $14.6 million, this segment's revenues increased $45.2 million or 8% organically. Revenue growth was generated within the segment's commercial site-based mechanical and Government Services divisions. With respect to commercial site-based and government services, new customer additions and scope expansion with existing customers were the primary drivers of the quarterly increase in revenues. Within Mechanical Services, a number of trends have favorably impacted us from a revenue perspective. Notably, we have seen an increase in service repair and maintenance volumes, partially as supply chain delays have resulted in the need to extend the useful lives of HVAC equipment in instances when replacement equipment is not readily available. In addition, there continues to be high demand for our building automation and control services with an emphasis on improving building efficiency and energy consumption, which is a priority for many of our customers in light of both increasing energy prices and a heightened focus on their environmental impact in the context of ESG. United States Industrial Services segment revenues of $310.7 million increased $75.3 million or 32%. As I commented during our earnings calls for the second half of 2021, we have begun to see some resumption in demand for maintenance and capital spending from this segment's customer base in the back half of last year. Such demand patterns continued through the first quarter of 2022 as we executed against a more normal spring turnaround season with improved demand for both field and shop services. Unfortunately, some of the macroeconomic headwinds that have been prevalent within the broader oil and gas industry persist, but with U.S. refinery utilization in excess of 90%, we are hopeful that 2022 will continue to develop favorably and that this segment's operating results will reflect that of a more normal pre-pandemic 12-month period. United Kingdom Building Services segment revenues of $131.5 million increased $4.8 million or 3.8% due to continued strong project volumes across their customer portfolio. Unfavorable exchange rate movements due to the weakening of the pound sterling negatively impacted this segment's quarter 1 2022 revenues by $3.9 million. Please turn to Slide 8. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $252.6 million represent 9.7% of first quarter revenues and compared to $224.1 million and 9.7% of revenues in the year ago period. SG&A for the first quarter includes approximately $5.2 million of incremental expenses from businesses acquired, inclusive of intangible asset amortization, resulting in an organic increase in SG&A of $23.3 million. With EMCOR's substantial revenue growth, we are adding personnel to support our back office and contract administration functions, resulting in increases in salaries and benefits from the corresponding 2021 period. Additionally, we continue to see an increase in medical expenses as claim activity related to both routine medical visits and elective procedures continues to normalize after being suppressed during 2020 and the early part of 2021. Travel and entertainment expenses have also increased as our team resumed certain business travel, although still below pre-pandemic levels. As previously disclosed, our SG&A as a percentage of revenues was flat at 9.7% for both quarter 1 periods. Reported operating income for the quarter was approximately $100 million or 3.9% of revenues and compares to operating income of $117 million or 5.1% of revenues a year ago. As a reminder, 2021's quarter 1 performance represented first quarter records for both operating income and operating margin. The overall decline in operating income and margin within the current quarter was due to quarter-over-quarter decreases in gross margins within each of our U.S. Electrical Construction, U.S. Mechanical Construction and U.S. Building Services segments. These reductions offset quarterly gains in both our U.S. Industrial Services and U.K. Building Services segments. Specific quarterly operating income performance by segment is as follows: Our U.S. Electrical Construction segment operating income of $20 million decreased $20.3 million from the comparable 2021 period. Reported operating margins of 3.8% represents a reduction from the 8.8% reported in last year's first quarter. The decrease in both operating income and operating margin is due to the reduction in both gross profit and gross profit margin previously mentioned, which was largely attributable to a change in this segment's project mix within the commercial market sector. In addition, whereas the prior year period benefited from the favorable progression on several extremely profitable projects, the current year's quarter was impacted by our customers' project schedules, which is heavily weighted towards the back half of the year. Lastly, and as previously mentioned, we experienced project delivery delays during the quarter due to supply chain difficulties impacting the receipt of equipment. These supply chain delays not only impacted project timelines, but also led to labor productivity and efficiency challenges, which is a major contributor to the significant reduction in this segment's operating margin quarter-over-quarter. First quarter operating income of our U.S. Mechanical Construction segment of $58.7 million represents a $4.5 million decrease from last year's quarter and operating margin of 5.9% represents a 100 basis point reduction from the 6.9% earned a year ago. As referenced during our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call, our Mechanical Construction segment currently has a larger number of contracts within the manufacturing and water and wastewater market sectors where we are either acting as construction manager or general contractor. In these cases, the percentage of our self-performed labor is less than typical, resulting in lower gross margin profile. This segment additionally experienced labor productivity issues resulting from supply chain disruptions as well as project write-downs resulting from material price escalation, a portion for which we will seek future recovery. Operating income for U.S. Building Services is $23.9 million or 3.8% of revenues and compares to $31.1 million or 5.5% of revenues in 2021's first quarter. Given a reduction in gross profit margin within this segment increased gross profit dollars resulting from the previously referenced revenue growth during the period was more than offset by an increase in SG&A expenses. Gross margin has declined due to a less favorable project mix within this segment's Mechanical Services division due to a higher percentage of fixed price capital projects, which typically have lower gross profit margins than this division's other service and repair offerings. Further impacting gross profit margin was a shift in the portfolio of project work being performed by the segment's commercial site-based services division, including a quarter-over-quarter decline and certain add-on work, such as COVID-19-related cleaning and sanitation services and an increase in more traditional facilities maintenance-type projects. In addition, our U.S. Building Services segment experienced unabsorbed labor costs due to supply chain disruptions where project delivery either has been delayed or job site productivity and efficiency has suffered due to incomplete shipments of material or equipment. Lastly, within the quarter, escalating fuel prices have reduced profitability as such prices increased at a faster rate than the fuel surcharges to our customers, which typically can only be adjusted after we experience the underlying cost increase. Though we were impacted in the quarter, as Tony referenced in his opening commentary, we have once again adjusted our pricing to account for these inflationary pressures. Our U.S. Industrial Services segment operating income of $13.3 million represents a $15.7 million improvement from the $2.4 million operating loss reported in 2021's first quarter. In the small victory column, this represents our Industrial segment's second consecutive quarter of operating profit since reporting periods prior to the pandemic. As referenced during my revenue commentary, we experienced more normalized demand during the quarter within both the segment's field and shop services operations. Turnarounds that we had forecasted to occur largely happened on schedule with some resulting pull-through cleaning and repair work. Operating margin was 4.3% for the first quarter of 2022. U.K. Building Services operating income of $10.6 million or 8.1% of revenues represents an increase of $1.2 million and a 70 basis point improvement in operating margin period-over-period. This improvement was primarily from a favorable project closeout within the quarter, coupled with continued strength in the commercial market sector, inclusive of various telecommunications projects. We are now on Slide 9. Additional financial items of significance for the quarter not addressed in the previous slides are as follows: Quarter 1 gross profit of $352.6 million is higher than the comparable prior year quarter by $11.5 million or 3.4%. However, gross margin of 13.6% is lower than the 14.8% in last year's first quarter, which set new first quarter records for both gross profit and gross margin. Needless to say, with our growth in revenues during the quarter, we did eclipse 2021's first quarter gross profit and we established a new quarter 1 gross profit record. However, for the reasons covered in my segment operating income discussion, we are reporting a reduction in quarterly gross margin. Diluted earnings per common share in the first quarter was $1.39 as compared to $1.54 per diluted share for the prior year period, despite the quarter-over-quarter reduction in EPS, the first quarter of 2022 represents our second best earnings per share performance in a first quarter. Although we experienced an approximately 13% decline in quarter-over-quarter reported net income, our reduction in outstanding shares through our share repurchase program softened the earnings per share impact of such net income decrease. We are now on Slide 10. EMCOR's balance sheet maintains its strength in liquidity. Cash on hand of over $500 million has decreased by $306.8 million from year-end 2021 and primarily as a result of cash used for financing activities of $193.5 million, inclusive of approximately $182 million of common stock repurchases made by us through March 31. In addition, we utilized $95.8 million of operating cash during the quarter, partially as a result of our strong organic revenue growth during the period. Additionally, as has historically been the case, our working capital needs tend to be greater in the first quarter of each year, partially due to our funding of prior year's incentive awards. Despite this use of cash during the first quarter, we anticipate the generation of positive operating cash flow as the year progresses. Working capital has decreased by just over $109 million, largely as a result of the decrease in cash just referenced which was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable, given the revenue growth during the period and a decrease in accrued payroll and benefits due to the incentive payments made during the quarter that I previously mentioned. Goodwill remains relatively consistent with that as of December 2021. Net identifiable intangible assets have decreased by nearly $15 million during 2022 as amortization expense taken more than offset the additional intangible assets recognized in connection with the acquisition we completed in Q1. Total debt, exclusive of operating lease liabilities remains nearly identical to that as of December, and EMCOR's debt to capitalization ratio has increased modestly from 10.4% at year-end 2021 to 10.9% at March 31, 2022, given the reduction in our shareholders' equity resulting from our share repurchase activity during the first quarter. As we stated before, our balance sheet in conjunction with the borrowing capacity available to us under our credit agreement will continue to enable us to invest in our business, return capital to shareholders and execute against our strategic objectives as we progress through 2022 and future periods. We remain committed to our capital allocation strategy as evidenced by both our share repurchase activity to date as well as today's announcement that our Board of Directors has increased the authorization under our share repurchase program. With my portion of this morning's slide presentation complete, I will now return the call to Tony. Tony? Yes, Sean, the only thing I would add to Tony's comment is we're presuming that revenue is going to continue to grow at the levels it did in the first quarter and presuming we're going to get some incremental improvement in margin contribution, which clearly we believe that or otherwise we would have changed guidance. It's going to be disproportionate, right? I mean I think the problem with the quarter that we're announcing today or that we announced today is that we didn't get the same level of pull-through from the revenue activity for all the reasons that were discussed prior to your question. We've done everything we can to make sure that for the things that I would define as self-inflicted are not going to recur in quarters 2, 3 or 4. If we get the external environment to stabilize at this point, we're comfortable with how it's going to shake out. Yes. I think Adam, once again, we don't control the timeline of our customers' projects. And when we entered into 2022, we definitely had different sequencing, especially in the data center space. So even with the delays that both Tony and I have mentioned during the call today, the way that the RPOs were going to burn through revenue was actually more late 2022 weighted than 2021. So when you look at our -- if you reflect back on 2021, our margin performance was actually stronger through the first 6 months than it was in the last 6 months of the year. And that was once again just because of the mix of work. That phenomenon is going to exist in 2022 as anticipated, except that it's the inverse. It's more back half of the year than first half of the year. So putting aside the supply chain discussions that we have had... Yes, the work is scheduled to happen later in the year. A couple of things that happened relative to the first quarter it certainly does not change the quantum of the year, but certainly did impact the first quarter. Refinery utilizations are high."

As we have previously announced, Mark and Kevin will close out two remarkable EMCOR careers on April 1st. I want to thank them for their hard work, dedication to EMCOR, and you've been great teammates. I know they both share our excitement about the future at EMCOR, as Jason will take the helm as our CFO. Andy will take over Kevin's Investor Relations responsibilities. I also want to recognize the promotion of Maxine Mauricio to Chief Administrative Officer, as she assumes some of the oversight duties previously held by Kevin. Thank you again to Kevin and Mark, congratulations to Jason and Maxine, and a continued warm welcome to Andy, who joined us this last fall. Now I'd like to turn you to Page 4 to 6 and that's where I'm going to start my comments. I'm going to focus most of my comments on our full year 2023 results, and Mark will go into more detail about our fourth quarter. We had a great fourth quarter at EMCOR. We outperformed our expectations, earning $4.47 per share on $3.44 billion in revenue, which represented 16.2% organic revenue growth. Our fourth quarter operating margin was exceptional at 8.4%. Fourth quarter rounded out an excellent 2023 by any measure. We did have an incredible 2023 with revenue of $12.6 billion, representing growth of 13.6% and organic revenue growth of 12.6%. Our earnings per share increased by approximately 65% and our operating income up $875.8 million, grew 55% over that of 2022 with record annual operating margin of 7%. Operating cash flow of $900 million represented a conversion in excess of 100% of operating income. We had a lot go right for us in EMCOR in 2023 and this incredible performance is a testament to our leadership at all levels of our company, including our segment and subsidiary leaders, who have delivered exceptional results for our customers, shareholders and teammates over an extended period of time. Over the last three years, we have more than doubled our earnings per share with a compound annual growth rate of 28% in a difficult and uncertain business environment. Our teams drive our results by a relentless focus on long term growth, productivity and innovation, balanced capital allocation, and we live our EMCOR values of mission first, people always, and they've been embraced throughout our company. We also have strong workforce training and development programs. We're fortunate to operate in large, growing market sectors like high tech manufacturing, network and communications, manufacturing and industrial. These sectors as well as our energy retrofit projects are benefiting from long term secular trends that require excellence in specialty trade contracting. We have challenges but we have met them and will continue to meet those challenges with resolve and with a strong focused execution at every turn. We finished the year with our RPOs at an all time high of $8.85 billion, which represents 2.5% sequential growth from September 30, 2023 and 18.6% growth over the year ago period. Now I'm going to probably share some highlights from our segments. We had excellent performance in each our mechanical and electrical construction and US Building Services segment. Mechanical construction had an especially stellar 2023. The operating results of our Industrial Services segment continue to improve at a measured pace. And despite unfavorable economic conditions, our UK Building Services segment is reporting solid operating income and operating margin. The continued strength of our electrical, mechanical construction segment is evidenced by 2023 revenue growth, up 14.4% and 18.2% respectively. With 2023 electrical construction operating margin of 8.3% and mechanical construction operating margin of 10.5%, the conversion from revenue to operating income by these segments has exceeded our expectations and really is a result of excellent execution, adaptability, smart project selection and favorable contract terms. In the construction segments, we selected key market sectors, estimated, negotiated in one meaningful projects, planned and executed such projects well and safely deploy our highly skilled labor with strong productivity. Our teams have increased productivity by deploying BIM, or building information modeling, and prefabrication at scale while sharing best practices on construction means and methods across our company. Said simply, we have learned from both our successes and failures. Then deploy those learnings across our company to drive excellent results for our customers and sheer financial returns for our shareholders. In our construction segments, we continue to win and complete some of the most sophisticated projects in markets such as high tech manufacturing, which includes semiconductors, the EV value chain, biotech, life sciences and pharmaceuticals. The network and in communications sector, which encompasses our data center work, and the manufacturing sector, which has been driven by reshoring domestic capacity expansion and also includes the renewable energy projects we're working on, and we have continued to see growth in our healthcare sector. As a reminder, our mechanical product offering is brought across applications such as HVAC, processed by plumbing, fire protection and life safety. We are operating in key geographies where such projects are in process, and our life safety group has the capability to move across the country. We are positioned well with the right resources in the right market sectors and geographies to continue to win complex projects that allow us to perform well for our customers. Our electrical and mechanical construction teams have deep expertise in data center market, which allows us to serve our customers with the right solution, delivered under the most demanding schedules with excellent outcome for our customers. As I have mentioned on earlier calls, our segment and subsidiary management teams are leading in an exceptional way and allocating resources in a thoughtful and pragmatic way. We continue to strive to optimize our project mix to produce great financial results. Our US Building Services segment continues its record of steady and impressive performance, and it has a strong mix of work across the service lines. This segment's revenues grew 13.3% in 2023 with an operating margin of 5.9%. Demand persists in our mechanical services division with excellent execution across retrofit projects, building controls and maintenance and repairs. We are working across a variety of end markets and our customers remain focused on energy efficiency and indoor air quality upgrades. The mechanical services business drove the robust performance of this segment in 2023 due in part to a strong repair service season this past summer as heat and humidity blanketed most parts of the country. The site [based] services division continues to deliver, entering into multiyear facility maintenance contracts to leverage our self perform operating model for skilled tradespeople and operating engineers. While opportunities for growth remain in this area, these facility services contracts take some time to ramp up. And the scope for these contracts can reduce, expand or be terminated over time and upon rebid. We have seen some contract degradations as the real estate facility providers are especially aggressive on price and scope on some of these contracts as they are struggling in their commercial real estate businesses. However, we will remain disciplined and not take any low price, low opportunity contracts. Our Industrial Services segment improved in 2023 and had sustained performance improvement over the last two years. Operating income improved by nearly 80% in the year, albeit from a low base. We had a more turn around seasons in 2023 and we had strong results from our niche services like heater repair. We are experiencing greater levels of capital spending within our shop services division in the form of increased new build heat exchanger orders and have benefited during the year from certain renewable fuel projects. We are just starting to see the resumption of demand for utility scale solar projects currently impacted by supply chain and permitting issues. Our Industrial Services and electrical team has us positioned well in the solar market and that position should continue to improve. Our UK segment performed in a manner consistent with the available market opportunities in 2023. The competition on some contracts is fierce as the UK economy is not strong. And similar to the US facility services market, we see the real estate companies bidding on contracts a bit aggressively due to weakness in the UK commercial real estate market. However, we have a normal base of facility services contracts, we'll build on that base and serve our customers well. And though we experienced a reduction in annual revenues in this segment, we are executing well as shown by the 5.9% operating margin for the year. Our balance sheet remains strong. It supports our organic growth and it provides us with the capital needed to expand our prefabrication capabilities, an investment in BIM, automation and robotics. We also have the firepower to continue to make strategic acquisitions, and I'm going to discuss that in more detail later. With that, Mark, I'm going to turn it over to you.\nMark Pompa: Great. Tony, thank you for those kind words you said earlier. And good morning, to everyone participating on our call today. For those accessing this presentation via the webcast, we are now on Slide 7. Over the next several slides, I will provide a detailed discussion of our fourth quarter 2023 results as well as a summary of our full year performance, some of which Tony just outlined during his opening commentary. As a reminder, all financial information discussed during this morning's call is included in our consolidated financial statements within both our earnings release announcement and Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier today. With that, let's begin our review of EMCOR's fourth quarter. Consolidated revenues of $3.44 billion increased $489.4 million or 16.6% from the fourth quarter of 2022. Each of our domestic reportable segments experienced revenue growth during the fourth quarter, which was the case for all four quarters of 2023. Revenues attributable to businesses acquired during the quarter were just under $11 million. So substantially all of our quarter-over-quarter revenue growth was due to organic activities. Our fourth quarter's consolidated revenues established a new all time quarterly revenue record for the company and eclipses our previous record set during the third quarter of 2023. The specifics to each of our reportable segment's fourth quarter revenue performance is as follows. United States electrical construction segment revenues of $763.4 million increased $49.8 million or 7% from quarter four of 2022. This segment continues to experience revenue growth across the majority of the market sectors that we serve, with the most significant fourth quarter revenue increases being generated within the manufacturing and industrial and high tech manufacturing market sectors. Revenues of our United States mechanical construction segment of $1.47 billion increased $339.3 million or approximately 30% from the year ago period. This segment experienced revenue growth across all market sectors in which we operate with the most significant growth occurring within the high tech manufacturing market sector. In addition, notable increases were seen within the manufacturing and industrial, network and communications, healthcare and water and wastewater market sectors. As communicated throughout the year, driven by customer projects supporting the design and manufacturing of semiconductors as well as production and development of electric vehicles and/or related battery technologies. This segment is experiencing strong demand for both fire and life safety as well as traditional mechanical services. This is in conjunction with continued data center development as well as the domestic reshoring of critical supply chain by certain of our customers, are the contributing factors to this segment's significant organic growth. Both our electrical and mechanical construction segments established new all time quarterly revenue records with their fourth quarter performance. Revenues of EMCOR's combined domestic construction segments totaled $2.24 billion for the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of $389.1 million or just over 21%. United States Building Services quarterly revenues of $802 million increased $88.6 million or 12.4%. Excluding incremental acquisition contribution, this segment's revenues grew 10.9% organically given increases across each of its operating divisions with the most significant growth being generated by mechanical services. Within mechanical services, we are benefiting from strong demand for HVAC projects and retrofits as well as building automation and control services, while customer initiatives to improve energy efficiency and/or indoor air quality are certainly contributing to this demand, our opportunities remain broad based and are further enhanced by mandated refrigerant phaseouts. In addition, our service volume continues to grow given an increase in our customer base as well as our geographic footprint. EMCOR's Industrial Services segment revenues of $292.5 million increased $16.2 million or 5.9% quarter-over-quarter. This marks this segment's fourth consecutive quarter of top line growth. In addition, to more normal maintenance demand, we experienced the resumption in capital spending by our customers in the form of new build heat exchanger orders and participation in several renewable fuel projects. United Kingdom Building Services segment revenues of $108.8 million represents a reduction of $4.5 million or 4% from last year's fourth quarter. As referenced throughout 2023, this segment's revenues have declined due to the nonrenewal of certain facilities maintenance contracts, which were still active in 2022 as well as the reduction in project work from certain of its segment's customers who slowed their capital spending programs in response to macroeconomic headwinds within the United Kingdom. Please turn to Slide 8. Reported operating income for the quarter was $289.2 million or 8.4% of revenues and favorably compares to $177.2 million of operating income or 6% of revenues a year ago. Consistent with my revenue commentary, our fourth quarter operating income and operating margin both established new all time quarterly records for EMCOR. This was achieved through increased operating income in each of our reportable segments, as well as expansion in operating margin in all but one of our segments. Specific fourth quarter operating performance by segment is as follows. Our US electrical construction segment earned operating income of $76.3 million, an increase of $18.2 million or 31.3% from the comparable 2022 period. The reported operating margin of 10% represents an improvement from 8.1% in last year's quarter. Increased gross profit and gross profit margin within the institutional commercial and high tech manufacturing market sectors were the primary drivers of this improved performance. As a reminder, the results of this segment during the fourth quarter of 2022 were negatively impacted by certain discrete project write-downs, which totaled $10 million and reduced this segment's operating margin by 140 basis points in the 2022 4th quarter. Operating income of our United States mechanical construction services segment of $186.1 million represents a substantial increase of $81.3 million from last year's quarter and operating margin of 12.6% represents an all time high for this segment. Greater gross profit dollars and gross profit margin in the majority of market sectors in which we operate, driven by a favorable revenue mix, successful project closeouts and better execution were the factors behind this segment's improved performance. Operating income for US Building Services was $42.1 million or 5.2% of revenues, which represents a 10.8% increase. The improved year-over-year performance was primarily due to the segment's mechanical services division, given the volume growth referenced during my revenue commentary, coupled with favorable execution on both our HVAC project and repair service activities. Our US Industrial Services segment operating income of $12.6 million or 4.3% of revenues represents an increase of just over $11 million from the corresponding 2022 period, led in the quarter by improved pricing within a shop services division, we are continuing to see operating margins of this segment move in an upward direction. UK Building Services is reporting operating income of $5.5 million or 5% of revenues, which compares favorably to that of the prior year period. The decrease in the segment's revenues was more than offset by increased operating margin as the segment continues to execute well across its portfolio of facilities, maintenance contracts and add-on project work. We are now on Slide 9. Additional financial items of significance for the quarter not addressed on the previous slides are as follows. Quarter four gross profit of $617.7 million represents an all time quarterly record for the company, and is higher than the comparable 2022 period by approximately $163 million or merely 36%. Gross margin of 18% has improved 260 basis points period-over-period. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $328.5 million represent 9.6% of revenues and reflect an increase of approximately $51 million from quarter four of 2022. SG&A for the current year's quarter includes $2.7 million of incremental expenses from businesses acquired, inclusive of intangible asset amortization, resulting in an organic increase of just over $48 million, which was largely driven by personnel costs. In addition to annual cost of living adjustments and greater employee benefit costs, our strong organic revenue growth has necessitated increased headcount across many of our businesses. Further, the operating income outperformance across the majority of our reportable segments during the fourth quarter and full year 2023 periods resulted in incremental incentive compensation expense. Diluted earnings per common share in the fourth quarter of 2023 is $4.47 compared to $2.63 per diluted share in the prior year. This fourth quarter EPS performance, like many of our financial metrics this quarter, eclipses EMCOR's prior all time quarterly diluted earnings per share record, which was previously established during the third quarter of 2023. Please turn to Slide 10. With the quarterly commentary complete, I will now supplement Tony's comprehensive introductory remarks at EMCOR's annual performance. Consolidated revenues of $12.6 billion represent an increase of $1.5 billion or 13.6% when compared to 2022. Our full year results include $107.1 million of incremental revenues attributable to businesses acquired pertaining to the time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in 2022. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, annual revenues increased to strong 12.6%, with all of our reportable segments other than our United Kingdom Building Services segment generating strong revenue growth during the full year period. Operating income of [$875.8] million or 7% of revenues represents the 55% increase from calendar year 2022, along with a 190 basis point improvement in operating margin. Each of our domestic reportable segments, as Tony commented, achieved double digit increases in full year operating income along with meaningful improvements in operating margin. Full year diluted earnings per share was $13.31 and compares to $8.10 in the corresponding 2022 period. Adjusting 2023 to exclude a third quarter impairment charge related to certain long lived assets within our United States mechanical construction segment results in an adjusted non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $13.34 for the year. This represents a 65% improvement over 2022's reported diluted EPS. Not surprising, with our strong performance throughout the last 12 months, full year 2023 represents a record year for EMCOR, surpassing the company's previous all time performance achieved in 2022. We are now on Slide 11. The strength of EMCOR's balance sheet continues to differentiate us from our competition and provides our customers with confidence as we bid on large scale and demanding projects. Given our balance sheet, coupled with the borrowing capacity available to us under our recently amended and extended revolving credit facility, we remain well positioned to fund organic growth, pursue strategic M&A opportunities and return capital to shareholders. Our commitment to shareholder return is evidenced in part by today's announcement that our Board of Directors has approved an increase in our quarterly dividend of almost 40%. The notable fluctuations in our balance sheet when compared to December of 2022 are as follows. Cash on hand is $790 million and represents an increase of just over $333 million. Our exceptional operating cash flow performance of $900 million, which Tony commented on earlier, was partially offset by cash used for financing activities of just over $412 million, given the repayment of all amounts previously outstanding under our term loan and the return of $160 million to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends, as well as cash used in investing activities of $161 million for acquisitions and capital expenditures. Resulting primarily from the increase in cash just referenced, our working capital balance has increased by just over $220 million from December of last year. Goodwill has increased by $37.4 million as a result of the eight acquisitions completed by us in calendar 2023, while net identifiable intangible assets have decreased by $7.9 million as the additional intangible assets recognized in connection with these acquisitions was more than offset by $67.1 million of the amortization expense in 2023. Total debt, exclusive of operating lease liabilities has decreased by $241.9 million, almost entirely as a result of the aforementioned repayments made on our previously outstanding term loan. After considering outstanding letters of credit, there remains $1.2 billion of capacity available to us under our renewed $1.3 billion revolving credit facility, the maturity of which now has been extended to December of 2028. Our stockholders' equity balance has increased by almost $500 million as our net income for the year exceeded our share repurchases and dividend payments made throughout 2023. EMCOR's debt-to-capitalization ratio has reduced to 0.2% from 11.1% at year end to 2022 given the full repayment of our term loan as well as the increase in stockholders' equity, both of what I had just referenced. With my portion of this morning's prepared comments complete, I will now give the call thankfully back to Tony.\nTony Guzzi: Thanks, Mark. And I'm going to start on Page 12. We really could think of this, the way we talk about earnings is, we just talked about everything that happened in the past, and this next section is all about the future. And if you go to Page 12, we've talked about this chart probably about three quarters ago, we started talking about it. And I look at this as a resource allocation chart. It not only informs how we allocate resources to drive organic growth but this chart also informs our capital allocation decisions, which we'll talk about later. So if you think about this chart and moving left to right, and it will be some intermixing. The first part is the electrification EV value chain, it's a trend. And there's been a lot in the news lately about what's happening, is it stalling and all that. In our world, it's not right now, because of where we played. For us, it's mainly been about fire and life safety and utility scale charging stations, and now solar is starting to come back up on the radar. But the way I think about this, this is a major transformation, whether EVs and the electrification is 10% of vehicles, whether it's 15% of vehicles, whether it's is 30%. And clearly, the policy got a little ahead of the technology here, but that's okay. At the end of the day, all these facilities will be built. Some of them, the battery infrastructure is going to have to be built again, no matter what penetration it has. It's a lot more than it is today. And the utility scale charging stations that we participated in, these are at major hubs of transportation. And some of this is well underway, because it makes sense, especially for delivery vehicles and other things that have lighter weights. The solar is just starting to reengage in our part of the world and we do that mainly in electrical. We do that some in the electrical segment, some in the sub-utility scale in building services, and we'll talk about that later. But then at scale, we do it in industrial services through our electrical business there. We have great capability there. And it's also supported by the IRA and government incentives. And we are privileged to be able to either do that with union labor where applicable or we have the necessary prevailing wage experience and apprenticeship programs in the nonunion world to be able to do that. And you'll hear that theme across some of these trends. Then you get to the high tech manufacturing, look, mainly on electrification, EV value chain, pretty good market. What we're building we're going to continue to build. All big markets go through periods of up and down but the long term trend, I think, is intact. And again, whether it's 7%, 15% or 30%, there's a lot of facilities, a lot of utility scale charging that needs to happen. And if we just get a share of the solar market going forward, we'll see that in our Industrial Services segment. You go to high tech manufacturing, life sciences and you really got to look at this box and draw a little loop down to reshoring and near shoring. We learned in COVID that supply chains weren't as resilient as they should be. I don't think we learned that, we probably knew that. But we needed to have a lesson like that. So we're seeing our customers move their supply chains back onshore. This was happening even before COVID, because the wage differential versus the transportation and the uncertainty of transportation was not what it was, and automation allow you to make up for a lot of that wage differential. But you're really seeing it, the semiconductor manufacturing, which we're such a big part of, and we've expanded where we can do that. We only could do that in a couple of markets before. Now we can do that and double that number. So when we were two before, now we're 4 to 6. And that is, for us, weighted towards mechanical. But in electrical, we still do that work there in fire and life safety. So it represented all trades but weighted more towards mechanical, and you see that in our RPOs. And you go to pharma, biotech, life sciences, again, there's two things happening there. There's reshoring and we're in a lot of the right markets to make that happen, whether it's the Carolinas, parts of California, Indiana or New Jersey. But there's also an explosion of new drugs, specifically around weight loss. And new lines are being added, new capacity, and we're part of that. And you're also seeing in this high tech manufacturing life safety, nearshoring, is these major tech companies building hubs outside of Silicon Valley, whether it be in Research Triangle Park, Texas or Arizona. Again, places we're well positioned to take advantage of helping our customers. And again, you go to the government incentives, it's focused on getting skilled trade labor on the job that's trained the right way. We do that either through our union relationships or through skilled apprenticeship programs. And you have to understand how to work in a PLA, a prevailing wage world, we're expert at that. And our subsidiary CEOs, our segment leadership and our corporate leadership knows how to put the right parameters around that to make sure that we comply with what we told our customers were, so they qualify for the incentives that they want to receive. Then you move to the right, and again, part of that high tech manufacturing is driven by AI and data center buildout. Go to data centers, we're really good. And we've been really good at this for a long period of time. We started this back in the early 2000s. There was a little bubble up in 2010, '11. We kept that capability. And that leadership we have in our electrical and mechanical segments and some of our subsidiary leaders, they are world class specialty contractors and data centers as is our fire life and safety offering. So what's driving demand here? Driving demand is us, right? We want more and more service. We -- big companies like EMCOR is putting more and more things in the cloud, but also the proliferation of AI, and that needs more systems. These went from 5, 10, 15-megawatt facilities to 50, 80, 100 megawatt facility. So just put that in perspective, if you look at an office building or even a hospital complex, you look at a large hospital complex, that maybe is 5 to 10 megawatts. So think about what that one data center is using today to drive the things we need to be more productive or to outsource or get things into the cloud. Increased power requirements, then you're going to go back to the remodel of some of the data centers that were built to uplift the power in there and also have different kinds of server racks. So we not only participate on the front end, electrically and mechanically in fire and life safety, we also participate in, we call it the day two work, to allow it to receive the racking and then also finally in the retrofit and remodel. We've done a lot of work around these three top trends over the past year and half, two years to understand the long term trends. We feel pretty good about where we're positioned. Going down to healthcare, EMCOR has always been world class hospital builders. It's hard to go into a major city that we're in and not know that we weren't part of that healthcare skyline. Whether it's the Texas Medical Center in Houston, whether it's Massachusetts General and a whole hospital complex past Fenway in Boston, whether it's in San Diego, whether it's in Chicago, we're part of that healthcare skyline. And what we learned in COVID, those facilities need to be redone in many cases, also need to be made more flexible. And when you think about those healthcare facilities, they are rich, system complex environments. They don't look other than some of the high purity things, which an operating room is, a lot different than these high tech manufacturing and life science plants. There's a lot of commonality between that hospital build and high tech manufacturing. And that allows me to talk about what we do -- I talked about it and started, this was a resource allocation game at EMCOR and figuring out where the best opportunities for us to perform, perform well, keep our workers safe and productive and get superior results for our shareholders. And so a lot of the capabilities we've built across these different boxes, we can use in the different boxes. And that is the wonderful thing about our skilled trades, that's the wonderful thing about our supervision. And the engineering that we have at EMCOR, which is more design assist, value engineering people that designed to build, right? We figure out how to make it more buildable and that's what BIM and prefabrication have allowed us to do. And last but not least, you get the energy efficiency and sustainability. I don't think any of us sit here to say and say, oh, yes, I know energy prices are going down in the long term. That can't be true because you have an energy transformation going on, coupled with this great demand coming out of things like high tech facilities, data centers, the electrification, they use a lot of energy. So energy efficiency is also for owners and energy security, people are concerned about reducing their emissions, because it's not only in a lot of ways the right thing to do, it's the most cost effective thing to do over the long term. And nobody does that better than our EMCOR mechanical services businesses, in Building Services, also partly in our mechanical construction business. Yes, the lighting is good and all that, that's a given. But the complex things we can do around HVAC design and what we can do with building control systems, we do that world class. We are one of the leading applied building controls companies in the country, and we can deliver superior results for mechanical solutions for our customers. And we've expanded our ability to do that with some recent acquisitions to talk about water and waste reduction, talk about the building envelope as part of someone's else drive to get facilities rationalization and energy efficiency. Sometimes you'll see these things coupled with an alternative energy solution or a cogen solution, where they'll add solar, they'll add a cogen solution where you're taking steam and converting it into a cooling or you're converting it into power. We have folks in the field, we have great engineers they know how to do that, that work within the built space to drive great energy efficiency and superior results for our customers and reduce their energy needs. So I could stop there. We could stop talking about the future, but we're going to go now shift to Page 13 and talk about RPOs and how that page, Page 12, manifests itself into RPOs. I mean ultimately, great trends, but you don't know how to capitalize and turn it into projects, really doesn't mean a whole lot. So if you look on Page 13, you can see the impact of those major trends in our RPOs. Total company RPOs at the end of 2023 were over $8.8 billion, up almost $1.4 billion or almost 19% over the December 2022 total of $7.5 billion. Additionally, fourth quarter project bookings were strong with RPOs increasing $212 million from September 30, 2023. Domestic construction services RPOs stand at $7.3 billion, a record, up $1.3 billion from December 2022, in line with strong project demand across most of the market sectors in which we operate, and then we've seen that throughout the year. Building Services, which are anchored by energy efficiency projects and retrofit projects ends 2023 with a healthy project pipeline and also exemplified by almost $1.3 billion of RPOs. RPOs by market sectors are balanced end market segmentation, bridging back to the previous page of organic growth trends in the marketplace. Looking into the actual activity, high tech manufacturing, which includes semiconductor, pharma, biotech, life sciences, R&D and the electric vehicle value chain stands at $1.5 billion, up $686 million or 89% from year end 2022. Network and communications, which includes hyperscale data center work, stands at almost $1.6 billion, up $578 million or 59% from December 31, 2022. Healthcare project demand continues to be strong as we have over $1 billion in healthcare RPOs, which is primarily made up of new hospital construction or expansion projects. We also currently have RPOs of nearly $650 million in water and wastewater projects, which for us are predominantly located in Florida's Miami Dade County and also the West Coast of Florida from targeted projects from Tampa to Naples. Reshoring and nearshoring trends continue for our manufacturing and industrial customers reflected in $808 million in project RPOs. During the year, we also saw increases in transportation and short duration projects. Partially offsetting these RPOs were decreases in commercial, that's primarily driven by warehouse and hospitality projects. However, with respect to warehouses, we are seeing an uptick in activity for cold storage warehouses and upgrades in those cold storage warehouses for our fire and life safety services and projects as customers introduce more automation and change warehouse configuration. As the calendar moves into 2024, we continue to see strong multiyear growth characteristics in many of the market sectors we serve. Our scale and operational excellence sets us apart from others in the marketplace and make our operating companies some of the most capable partners for our customers. As the diversity in our RPOs demonstrates, we have the flexibility and capability to move across these sectors to address trends in the markets as they arise. As we progress through 2024, the pace and compositions of RPOs may change, based on the way our customers contract with us and become more familiar and part of their site build up. Once we are on a customer site frequently or sometimes subsequent portions of the project at the site are awarded in scopes of work that are smaller than the initial award. And second, supply chain issues and lead times are now being factored into the initial planning, thus avoiding the previous delay that led to some of the buildup in RPOs, especially in Building Services. With respect to capital allocation, which I'm going to show to you on Slide 14, our Board has approved an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.18 per share to $0.25 per share. We have a good acquisition pipeline and tend to use some of our firepower to execute deals. We recently signed definitive agreements to purchase a company in Texas and one in the Greater Atlanta area, both of which add capabilities to our mechanical construction segment. We also bought a company or signed an agreement for a company, which will be a bolt-on for our mechanical services division. We expect to send around $140 million in aggregate upfront purchase price in connection with these acquisitions. We expect to close these acquisitions as we move further into 2024. And we'll take the opportunity to expand our capabilities and increase our geographic reach to better serve our customers when we can purchase companies with the right skills and culture. We like our pipeline of deals, but as I always said, deals happen when they happen. Now let's turn to Page 15 and 16. Our exceptional performance in 2023 resulted in three meaningful guidance increases in 2023, as our operating margin strengthened throughout the year, primarily because we performed well and efficiently on difficult and complex projects, some of these projects had favorable contract terms. And what that really means is we don't get into protracted disputes with our customers. We work to finish the job together. And we had some outstanding disputes that we successfully resolved in 2023. As we set guidance for 2024, it is important to remember what I mentioned earlier at the start of this call. We're coming off a three year CAGR of nearly 28% and we had 65% growth in earnings per share this past year. We do expect to continue to grow earnings for our shareholders this year. For 2024, we will set guidance at $13.5 billion to $14 billion in revenues and $14 to $15 in diluted earnings per share. Our guidance assumes strong operating margin performance. Our guidance assumes strong operating margin performance. As previously discussed, we started the year with excellent RPOs in our electrical and mechanical construction segments, and a good base of RPOs in our mechanical services division within our US Building Services segment. However, we have nearly $300 million in revenue headwinds in the US and UK Building Services segment combined. They are coming from the result of loss of facility services contract that we lost on rebid despite strong customer scores on our service delivery. Despite this, we still expect low to mid single digit revenue growth in US Building Services. As reflected in our RPOs and as discussed previously, we continue to work and win work in important and strategic market sectors. We are executing our work with efficiency and precision as shown by our operating margins. We are utilizing BIM prefabrication in our labor and supply management capabilities with an eye towards delivering superior results for our customers and shareholders. However, as I stated in previous calls, it is important to remember that operating margins can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on mix, execution and timing of projects. We evaluate our operating margin performance in terms of ranges over quarters. And our performance in 2023 yielded operating margins for most of our segments, which were at or above the high end of our historical ranges, especially in our mechanical construction segment. We've shown great resilience in dealing with supply chain issues and continue to develop a strong bench performance through project managers to senior leadership. Further, we are attracting notable talent from skilled labor to senior project and operations management. Our outlook for 2024 is positive and for our ability to achieve the upper end of our guidance range, macroeconomic factors and other factors will come into play potentially. We remain concerned with the financial risk to some customers around continued elevated interest rates and also the macro uncertainties posed by the [Europe], the conflict and unrest in the Middle East and their impact on global energy markets and supply chains, as well as the dysfunction occurring in the US Government, which may lead to a government shutdown or the inability key pieces of legislation. We also realized that our customers adjust the scope and timing of long term projects, consistent with their immediate, intermediate and long term capacity needs. Despite these challenges, we believe that we will be able to navigate these uncertainties as we have as our team has shown great resiliency in the past. We remain cognizant of these external factors and the potential impact on our execution and performance. We're going to continue to be balanced capital allocators. Specifically, as discussed previously, there remain opportunities within our acquisition pipeline and we just increased our dividend -- quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share. We will continue to pursue opportunities to grow profitably, both organically and through acquisitions and our share repurchase program remains in place. As I've said before, with the uncertainty in the financial markets, we believe that our strong balance sheet helps us win work on large sophisticated projects as customers see our financial strength as just another reason to choose EMCOR. As always, I want to thank the entire EMCORE team for their dedication and hard work. We appreciate all you do every day for our customers. With that, I'll turn it over to you, Alan, to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson.\nBrent Thielman: Tony, I heard you say twice, guidance assumes strong margin performance. Have heard you mentioned for quarters now favorable contract terms is it really sort of one factor here for the really strong margins, but I don't imagine that's changing with the new work you're taking into the business. But are those better terms broad based, is it confined to a few of the really hot areas and markets within the business? I just wanted to hear you maybe talk about that.\nTony Guzzi: Well, the better terms are mainly focused around liquidity in the project, right, cash flow, keep the project moving. And that wouldn't be an issue with us but we negotiate hard for those, because the better the cash flow on the project is typically the projects moving well. Secondarily, the better terms around, okay, if we're going to expand scope with the method for which we're going to expand scope, so we don't get into the change order discussions that are extended and really affect productivity. Some of it's around general conditions, the realization that we want people to have the right general conditions to be able to execute the project well. And finally, I think the better contractual terms around how things convert, whether they go from a fee based contract, GMP to a fixed price and what would be the mechanism to do that? You put all that together, yes, I think the larger the project right now, the more are those terms are favorable both for the owner and for us, because it's a clear eye view of how we're going to work together.\nBrent Thielman: And then comparing your RPOs to last year, the RPOs to be executed within a lot, the RPO is kind of beyond one years down compared to that same number last year. And I guess, Tony, the question is, is the response there, what you said in the opening commentary that you may be on these customer sites already and so you can essentially sort of turn the work faster, or is there more to it than that?\nTony Guzzi: No, that's basically it, coupled with the pace and timing of some of this large work, I mean times money, especially in the data center space. And as a result, you have to be a big sophisticated contractor that has the financial resources to mobilize on the site, being able to assemble a trained workforce with the right training on a job that might have been in planning, we get it, we may have a month and half to mobilize, within four months we're at full production and within nine months, some of these big data center jobs what we do on the -- the guts of it are done. And then if you go to the other side of that, if you're already at a significant semiconductor site or a EV site or even a health care facility, or any manufacturing site, there's a lot of work that has to get done initially to set the utility infrastructure and mobilize and get everybody to say, okay, we're going to be here. But then as they build the other parts of the site, add tooling, other things, you may get that in an award that will build to something almost the same size in chunks that are 15% to 20% of what you ultimately overdo on that scope.\nBrent Thielman: And then I thought it was [Technical Difficulty] employee heacount saw a bigger increase last year than we've seen since the onset of the pandemic for the company. I guess, Tony, do you feel like you have the right amount of kind of human capital to address the opportunities you see out there or is it an impediment to you by any means? Just curious\u2026\nTony Guzzi: It hasn't been an impediment yet, Brent. We always say that we're always -- with an eye towards that, we've always had good success building it. The impediment actually we\u2019ll find the skilled tradespeople. It's how quickly we can develop foreman, how quickly we develop project managers to move from being someone that was helping on the job or was an assistant foreman to move up to run big work, likewise with project managers. We've also had pretty good success subtracting how we are winning, people like [indiscernible]. And we've also had pretty good success attracting skilled foreman and project managers from other parts of the country when we're building out some of these sites from other companies and also from other industries.\nBrent Thielman: Just last one, Mark. The free cash conversion noticeably strong this year just compared to the last five years, taking away 2020 COVID. But can we think this conversion rate can continue off the guidance you've given here?\nMark Pompa: Unfortunately, not, Brent. I think as Tony mentioned, with regards to some of our contract negotiations for some of our larger, more sophisticated work, we've been successful in making sure that we're staying ahead of the curve with regards to being provided the necessary working capital to complete those jobs based on advanced billings and payments. We cannot continue the cycle of collecting more cash than income earned. I don't think any company can. So I suspect 2024 is going to look more normal. So I think an appropriate benchmark would be 2022 or 2021 [Technical Difficulty] plus or minus, yes. And a lot of that, once again, not to sound like a broken record is highly determined based on progression of work. But at the end of the day, we much rather be in the position we're currently in than on the other side of the curve with regards to trying to chase collections once a project is complete.\nTony Guzzi: We've always looked at cash flow. If you're earning at net income, it means the business is in pretty good shape, right? And if we're in the construction businesses, Jason, what do you think, 75%?\nJason Nalbandian: 75% to 80%.\nTony Guzzi: Op income, that means our project portfolio is usually pretty good and that we don't have a lot of jobs that are eating cash, because they're in some form of dispute or they're delayed or anything. So when you're overperforming like we did this year versus operating, like Mark said, it's because specifically go to the mobilization we had on some of these big sites. We negotiate really hard upfront to make sure that we're not have a big cash drain as we mobilize on these sites, and sometimes that takes a long time to negotiate that. And also sometime we\u2019ll start on that, the one form of contract structure. And then over time, that contract structure will change from a fee based or T&M plus to more of a fixed price flow, because now we know what it costs to put labor on the site. We know the composition of the workforce, we're going to work force for the next three or four, or five years, hopefully. And then we know the owner and the GCs and the engineering firms we're going to work with how they get change orders down, how they get add moved. And so we have great folks on the ground that know this art. It's not a science, it's an art, and they do it really well. And they've a lot of experienced people help them quarterback that. And it's really the power of our corporate segment and subsidiary teams working together to bring that home on a site and to bring the cash flow home.\nJason Nalbandian: Tony, not to belabor the point. But when we look at kind of a normalized historical cash flow, right, over the last couple of years and we adjust for some of the impacts we saw with COVID, whether it was deferred FICA payments, I think a reasonable kind of historical average is somewhere between 70% and 80% of operating at a consolidated basis.\nTony Guzzi: Which gets you at net income or a little bit above. Does that make sense, Brent?\nBrent Thielman: That makes sense. Appreciate all the help.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer of Thompson Davis.\nAdam Thalhimer: I guess I wanted to start on RPOs. So commercial is obviously down year-over-year, which is not [Technical Difficulty]. so my question would be, do you think these other segments can continue to offset commercial weakness?\nTony Guzzi: Well, I think, Adam, with guidance out of $13.5 billion to $14 billion know that not all our revenues and RPOs but we feel pretty strongly that these other trends will continue through the year. As far as RPOs go, there could be fits and starts in the RPOs in some of these segments as work gets let. But we feel really good about Page 12 and the underlying drivers of our business and we think that we will continue to win. And the good news for us is we're balanced across market sectors. So as I talked about on Page 12, the skilled trade because these are complex projects and then when we share knowledge so well across our company on how to build and means and methods that our supervision can deploy that skilled trades on any number of industries once they get going. And that's been the strength of EMCORE over a long period of time and we expect it to continue to be so. So the short answer is -- I give you a shocking thing here, Adam. I think over the last seven, eight years, maybe a couple of mixed use buildings but as far as commercial skyscrapers where we were the core person doing the core building shell and everything else who was with that, not talking tenant fit out on commercial, I think we've built two, Mark, right, in 9 years now. We have one underway right now that's really a delayed project in 2017, and it's going fine. But that's not been the heart of EMCOR's business for a while. We still are big in the tenant fit out place, which where we operate, how we always like to say, we at EMCOR operate and earn in the Class A office space for tenant fit out and retrofits and everything and we occupy Class B and C space because of the nature of what we do. So where we operate we're fine, because that's still buoyant, a lot of movement, we\u2019re reconfiguring and figuring workspaces, new buildings. And then if you go to the other side of that, on the B&C space, quite frankly, it's not a bad time to be looking for space.\nAdam Thalhimer: Tony, fire and life safety, do you think it makes sense to break that out as a segment for us?\nTony Guzzi: No, I don't think\u2026\nAdam Thalhimer: I mean, clearly, you're seeing good trends. And I'm just -- I'm curious on forward trends there.\nTony Guzzi: It's such an integral part of mechanical and how mechanical jobs thought about, and it's such a heart of our shops and everything. It would be hard to break out because it's ingrained in some of the companies and how they operate. That being said, it's an important part of our business. And it has a real success factor with our customers to deliver results on very complicated facilities across the country. Now that has some unique characteristics that make it on a trade delivery standpoint, it has a national union, right? Most trade businesses don't have a national union. Like the rest of the mechanical business, it's gravitated more towards prefab. Like the rest of the mechanical business, you have to have excellence in craft in the field and multidiscipline, they can do multisize pipe and really engineering. So it also has more of a design assist element as the rest of the mechanical business has gravitated towards. So that's why it's so integral to that mechanical business and it really wouldn't make sense to have it look different than the rest of the mechanical business.\nAdam Thalhimer: And then just last one on data centers. One big tech company said, US data center capacity, I think they said will double in the next five years. So I'm just curious if your funnel kind of matches that comment?\nTony Guzzi: We've done a lot of work around it. We think it grows high single digits to mid teens for a while. So yes.\nOperator: The next question comes from Alex Dwyer of KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAlex Dwyer: Can I just start off with -- can you talk about the semiconductor and the CHIPS Act opportunity set. So like we're seeing -- there's more grant funding coming to market in the past couple of weeks and next coming weeks, but there's also beem some major fab project delays. I'm just wondering how we should think about the opportunity set over the next 12 months in light of these two diverging signals next 12 months?\nTony Guzzi: Next 12 months? Good. I mean it's the next 12 months, we have most of it already in RPOs and we know what the work we'll be doing on some of these critical sites. When you think about the delays, actually, that's not bad for us in some cases. We're building the infrastructure around that, they have to staff them. It allows the sites to become much more after the initial build, they start to winnow down to the contractors that are the winners on that site that have done great work for them. On the sites that we are, we emphatically are those contractors.\nAlex Dwyer: And then how would you compare and contrast like the semiconductor build out versus the data center build out in terms of like the duration of the cycle and based on what you're hearing from your customers on discussions on plans? I'm just trying to wonder like, is one a five year cycle, is one a 10 year cycle? Just any thoughts on duration of the two cycles?\nTony Guzzi: I don't really have -- we\u2019re contractors, we tend to look at things in three to five year cycles. And as we look at things over the next three to five years, we feel pretty good about that. Again, we can deploy our resources to the best opportunities. Secondarily, I give you a real world case. If someone comes in and the semiconductor market is going to be strong in a market we have our share of work or maybe we're not even playing in the semiconductor market in that market. The rest of the work that happened around, because it usually becomes a buoyant infrastructure that's part of that, whether it\u2019d be warehousing, whether it\u2019d be health care, the area tends to grow. We may do all those jobs and not do the semiconductor work. For us, it's a matter of resource allocation. How better serve the jobs and what the best opportunities are. Data center, I said, again, both and we look really strong for the next three to five years. I would say the data center business is a much more stable business and how they're going to staff it. Because they don't -- think about a data center, they have to get the technology right and a lot of them know how to do that and they're thinking of redesign. The data center human resource end of it is all on the construction side. The actual operating of the data center requires very few people. So once they get them up and running, it's much easier for them to think about capacity planning. Contrast that with the semiconductor world, you have -- some of them have established work forces in some of these markets. They have a much easier time thinking about expansion and growing. For someone that comes in knew it the first time, they may hire one and half workers to two workers for everyone that's going to stick with them on the production side. The construction side, there's a workforce that knows how to do that work after the first one. The construction folks aren't the issue. We would say that a -- I don't want to say slow down, a more thoughtfully planned next three or four phases on that. Once you get up and running leads to a more orderly construction site, we know how to work together and it goes on. We're all for them taking their time and getting them staffed correctly and becoming successful versus just build, build, build. It\u2019s better for us and our planning, it's better for them also. So bullish on both, data center does not have the human resource issue after the fact that semiconductors does.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tony Guzzi for any closing remarks.\nTony Guzzi: Thank you all. We look forward to hearing and working with you all in 2024. And with that, we now put a wrap on 2023.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Pompa",
            "content": "Great. Tony, thank you for those kind words you said earlier. And good morning, to everyone participating on our call today. For those accessing this presentation via the webcast, we are now on Slide 7. Over the next several slides, I will provide a detailed discussion of our fourth quarter 2023 results as well as a summary of our full year performance, some of which Tony just outlined during his opening commentary. As a reminder, all financial information discussed during this morning's call is included in our consolidated financial statements within both our earnings release announcement and Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier today. With that, let's begin our review of EMCOR's fourth quarter. Consolidated revenues of $3.44 billion increased $489.4 million or 16.6% from the fourth quarter of 2022. Each of our domestic reportable segments experienced revenue growth during the fourth quarter, which was the case for all four quarters of 2023. Revenues attributable to businesses acquired during the quarter were just under $11 million. So substantially all of our quarter-over-quarter revenue growth was due to organic activities. Our fourth quarter's consolidated revenues established a new all time quarterly revenue record for the company and eclipses our previous record set during the third quarter of 2023. The specifics to each of our reportable segment's fourth quarter revenue performance is as follows. United States electrical construction segment revenues of $763.4 million increased $49.8 million or 7% from quarter four of 2022. This segment continues to experience revenue growth across the majority of the market sectors that we serve, with the most significant fourth quarter revenue increases being generated within the manufacturing and industrial and high tech manufacturing market sectors. Revenues of our United States mechanical construction segment of $1.47 billion increased $339.3 million or approximately 30% from the year ago period. This segment experienced revenue growth across all market sectors in which we operate with the most significant growth occurring within the high tech manufacturing market sector. In addition, notable increases were seen within the manufacturing and industrial, network and communications, healthcare and water and wastewater market sectors. As communicated throughout the year, driven by customer projects supporting the design and manufacturing of semiconductors as well as production and development of electric vehicles and/or related battery technologies. This segment is experiencing strong demand for both fire and life safety as well as traditional mechanical services. This is in conjunction with continued data center development as well as the domestic reshoring of critical supply chain by certain of our customers, are the contributing factors to this segment's significant organic growth. Both our electrical and mechanical construction segments established new all time quarterly revenue records with their fourth quarter performance. Revenues of EMCOR's combined domestic construction segments totaled $2.24 billion for the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of $389.1 million or just over 21%. United States Building Services quarterly revenues of $802 million increased $88.6 million or 12.4%. Excluding incremental acquisition contribution, this segment's revenues grew 10.9% organically given increases across each of its operating divisions with the most significant growth being generated by mechanical services. Within mechanical services, we are benefiting from strong demand for HVAC projects and retrofits as well as building automation and control services, while customer initiatives to improve energy efficiency and/or indoor air quality are certainly contributing to this demand, our opportunities remain broad based and are further enhanced by mandated refrigerant phaseouts. In addition, our service volume continues to grow given an increase in our customer base as well as our geographic footprint. EMCOR's Industrial Services segment revenues of $292.5 million increased $16.2 million or 5.9% quarter-over-quarter. This marks this segment's fourth consecutive quarter of top line growth. In addition, to more normal maintenance demand, we experienced the resumption in capital spending by our customers in the form of new build heat exchanger orders and participation in several renewable fuel projects. United Kingdom Building Services segment revenues of $108.8 million represents a reduction of $4.5 million or 4% from last year's fourth quarter. As referenced throughout 2023, this segment's revenues have declined due to the nonrenewal of certain facilities maintenance contracts, which were still active in 2022 as well as the reduction in project work from certain of its segment's customers who slowed their capital spending programs in response to macroeconomic headwinds within the United Kingdom. Please turn to Slide 8. Reported operating income for the quarter was $289.2 million or 8.4% of revenues and favorably compares to $177.2 million of operating income or 6% of revenues a year ago. Consistent with my revenue commentary, our fourth quarter operating income and operating margin both established new all time quarterly records for EMCOR. This was achieved through increased operating income in each of our reportable segments, as well as expansion in operating margin in all but one of our segments. Specific fourth quarter operating performance by segment is as follows. Our US electrical construction segment earned operating income of $76.3 million, an increase of $18.2 million or 31.3% from the comparable 2022 period. The reported operating margin of 10% represents an improvement from 8.1% in last year's quarter. Increased gross profit and gross profit margin within the institutional commercial and high tech manufacturing market sectors were the primary drivers of this improved performance. As a reminder, the results of this segment during the fourth quarter of 2022 were negatively impacted by certain discrete project write-downs, which totaled $10 million and reduced this segment's operating margin by 140 basis points in the 2022 4th quarter. Operating income of our United States mechanical construction services segment of $186.1 million represents a substantial increase of $81.3 million from last year's quarter and operating margin of 12.6% represents an all time high for this segment. Greater gross profit dollars and gross profit margin in the majority of market sectors in which we operate, driven by a favorable revenue mix, successful project closeouts and better execution were the factors behind this segment's improved performance. Operating income for US Building Services was $42.1 million or 5.2% of revenues, which represents a 10.8% increase. The improved year-over-year performance was primarily due to the segment's mechanical services division, given the volume growth referenced during my revenue commentary, coupled with favorable execution on both our HVAC project and repair service activities. Our US Industrial Services segment operating income of $12.6 million or 4.3% of revenues represents an increase of just over $11 million from the corresponding 2022 period, led in the quarter by improved pricing within a shop services division, we are continuing to see operating margins of this segment move in an upward direction. UK Building Services is reporting operating income of $5.5 million or 5% of revenues, which compares favorably to that of the prior year period. The decrease in the segment's revenues was more than offset by increased operating margin as the segment continues to execute well across its portfolio of facilities, maintenance contracts and add-on project work. We are now on Slide 9. Additional financial items of significance for the quarter not addressed on the previous slides are as follows. Quarter four gross profit of $617.7 million represents an all time quarterly record for the company, and is higher than the comparable 2022 period by approximately $163 million or merely 36%. Gross margin of 18% has improved 260 basis points period-over-period. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $328.5 million represent 9.6% of revenues and reflect an increase of approximately $51 million from quarter four of 2022. SG&A for the current year's quarter includes $2.7 million of incremental expenses from businesses acquired, inclusive of intangible asset amortization, resulting in an organic increase of just over $48 million, which was largely driven by personnel costs. In addition to annual cost of living adjustments and greater employee benefit costs, our strong organic revenue growth has necessitated increased headcount across many of our businesses. Further, the operating income outperformance across the majority of our reportable segments during the fourth quarter and full year 2023 periods resulted in incremental incentive compensation expense. Diluted earnings per common share in the fourth quarter of 2023 is $4.47 compared to $2.63 per diluted share in the prior year. This fourth quarter EPS performance, like many of our financial metrics this quarter, eclipses EMCOR's prior all time quarterly diluted earnings per share record, which was previously established during the third quarter of 2023. Please turn to Slide 10. With the quarterly commentary complete, I will now supplement Tony's comprehensive introductory remarks at EMCOR's annual performance. Consolidated revenues of $12.6 billion represent an increase of $1.5 billion or 13.6% when compared to 2022. Our full year results include $107.1 million of incremental revenues attributable to businesses acquired pertaining to the time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in 2022. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, annual revenues increased to strong 12.6%, with all of our reportable segments other than our United Kingdom Building Services segment generating strong revenue growth during the full year period. Operating income of [$875.8] million or 7% of revenues represents the 55% increase from calendar year 2022, along with a 190 basis point improvement in operating margin. Each of our domestic reportable segments, as Tony commented, achieved double digit increases in full year operating income along with meaningful improvements in operating margin. Full year diluted earnings per share was $13.31 and compares to $8.10 in the corresponding 2022 period. Adjusting 2023 to exclude a third quarter impairment charge related to certain long lived assets within our United States mechanical construction segment results in an adjusted non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $13.34 for the year. This represents a 65% improvement over 2022's reported diluted EPS. Not surprising, with our strong performance throughout the last 12 months, full year 2023 represents a record year for EMCOR, surpassing the company's previous all time performance achieved in 2022. We are now on Slide 11. The strength of EMCOR's balance sheet continues to differentiate us from our competition and provides our customers with confidence as we bid on large scale and demanding projects. Given our balance sheet, coupled with the borrowing capacity available to us under our recently amended and extended revolving credit facility, we remain well positioned to fund organic growth, pursue strategic M&A opportunities and return capital to shareholders. Our commitment to shareholder return is evidenced in part by today's announcement that our Board of Directors has approved an increase in our quarterly dividend of almost 40%. The notable fluctuations in our balance sheet when compared to December of 2022 are as follows. Cash on hand is $790 million and represents an increase of just over $333 million. Our exceptional operating cash flow performance of $900 million, which Tony commented on earlier, was partially offset by cash used for financing activities of just over $412 million, given the repayment of all amounts previously outstanding under our term loan and the return of $160 million to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends, as well as cash used in investing activities of $161 million for acquisitions and capital expenditures. Resulting primarily from the increase in cash just referenced, our working capital balance has increased by just over $220 million from December of last year. Goodwill has increased by $37.4 million as a result of the eight acquisitions completed by us in calendar 2023, while net identifiable intangible assets have decreased by $7.9 million as the additional intangible assets recognized in connection with these acquisitions was more than offset by $67.1 million of the amortization expense in 2023. Total debt, exclusive of operating lease liabilities has decreased by $241.9 million, almost entirely as a result of the aforementioned repayments made on our previously outstanding term loan. After considering outstanding letters of credit, there remains $1.2 billion of capacity available to us under our renewed $1.3 billion revolving credit facility, the maturity of which now has been extended to December of 2028. Our stockholders' equity balance has increased by almost $500 million as our net income for the year exceeded our share repurchases and dividend payments made throughout 2023. EMCOR's debt-to-capitalization ratio has reduced to 0.2% from 11.1% at year end to 2022 given the full repayment of our term loan as well as the increase in stockholders' equity, both of what I had just referenced. With my portion of this morning's prepared comments complete, I will now give the call thankfully back to Tony. Unfortunately, not, Brent. I think as Tony mentioned, with regards to some of our contract negotiations for some of our larger, more sophisticated work, we've been successful in making sure that we're staying ahead of the curve with regards to being provided the necessary working capital to complete those jobs based on advanced billings and payments. We cannot continue the cycle of collecting more cash than income earned. I don't think any company can. So I suspect 2024 is going to look more normal. So I think an appropriate benchmark would be 2022 or 2021 [Technical Difficulty] plus or minus, yes. And a lot of that, once again, not to sound like a broken record is highly determined based on progression of work. But at the end of the day, we much rather be in the position we're currently in than on the other side of the curve with regards to trying to chase collections once a project is complete."

Before we begin, though, I would like to recognize two of our executives, Mark Pompa and Kevin Matz. As we have previously announced, Mark and Kevin will close out two remarkable EMCOR careers on April 1st. I want to thank them for their hard work, dedication to EMCOR, and you've been great teammates. I know they both share our excitement about the future at EMCOR, as Jason will take the helm as our CFO. Andy will take over Kevin's Investor Relations responsibilities. I also want to recognize the promotion of Maxine Mauricio to Chief Administrative Officer, as she assumes some of the oversight duties previously held by Kevin. Thank you again to Kevin and Mark, congratulations to Jason and Maxine, and a continued warm welcome to Andy, who joined us this last fall. Now I'd like to turn you to Page 4 to 6 and that's where I'm going to start my comments. I'm going to focus most of my comments on our full year 2023 results, and Mark will go into more detail about our fourth quarter. We had a great fourth quarter at EMCOR. We outperformed our expectations, earning $4.47 per share on $3.44 billion in revenue, which represented 16.2% organic revenue growth. Our fourth quarter operating margin was exceptional at 8.4%. Fourth quarter rounded out an excellent 2023 by any measure. We did have an incredible 2023 with revenue of $12.6 billion, representing growth of 13.6% and organic revenue growth of 12.6%. Our earnings per share increased by approximately 65% and our operating income up $875.8 million, grew 55% over that of 2022 with record annual operating margin of 7%. Operating cash flow of $900 million represented a conversion in excess of 100% of operating income. We had a lot go right for us in EMCOR in 2023 and this incredible performance is a testament to our leadership at all levels of our company, including our segment and subsidiary leaders, who have delivered exceptional results for our customers, shareholders and teammates over an extended period of time. Over the last three years, we have more than doubled our earnings per share with a compound annual growth rate of 28% in a difficult and uncertain business environment. Our teams drive our results by a relentless focus on long term growth, productivity and innovation, balanced capital allocation, and we live our EMCOR values of mission first, people always, and they've been embraced throughout our company. We also have strong workforce training and development programs. We're fortunate to operate in large, growing market sectors like high tech manufacturing, network and communications, manufacturing and industrial. These sectors as well as our energy retrofit projects are benefiting from long term secular trends that require excellence in specialty trade contracting. We have challenges but we have met them and will continue to meet those challenges with resolve and with a strong focused execution at every turn. We finished the year with our RPOs at an all time high of $8.85 billion, which represents 2.5% sequential growth from September 30, 2023 and 18.6% growth over the year ago period. Now I'm going to probably share some highlights from our segments. We had excellent performance in each our mechanical and electrical construction and US Building Services segment. Mechanical construction had an especially stellar 2023. The operating results of our Industrial Services segment continue to improve at a measured pace. And despite unfavorable economic conditions, our UK Building Services segment is reporting solid operating income and operating margin. The continued strength of our electrical, mechanical construction segment is evidenced by 2023 revenue growth, up 14.4% and 18.2% respectively. With 2023 electrical construction operating margin of 8.3% and mechanical construction operating margin of 10.5%, the conversion from revenue to operating income by these segments has exceeded our expectations and really is a result of excellent execution, adaptability, smart project selection and favorable contract terms. In the construction segments, we selected key market sectors, estimated, negotiated in one meaningful projects, planned and executed such projects well and safely deploy our highly skilled labor with strong productivity. Our teams have increased productivity by deploying BIM, or building information modeling, and prefabrication at scale while sharing best practices on construction means and methods across our company. Said simply, we have learned from both our successes and failures. Then deploy those learnings across our company to drive excellent results for our customers and sheer financial returns for our shareholders. In our construction segments, we continue to win and complete some of the most sophisticated projects in markets such as high tech manufacturing, which includes semiconductors, the EV value chain, biotech, life sciences and pharmaceuticals. The network and in communications sector, which encompasses our data center work, and the manufacturing sector, which has been driven by reshoring domestic capacity expansion and also includes the renewable energy projects we're working on, and we have continued to see growth in our healthcare sector. As a reminder, our mechanical product offering is brought across applications such as HVAC, processed by plumbing, fire protection and life safety. We are operating in key geographies where such projects are in process, and our life safety group has the capability to move across the country. We are positioned well with the right resources in the right market sectors and geographies to continue to win complex projects that allow us to perform well for our customers. Our electrical and mechanical construction teams have deep expertise in data center market, which allows us to serve our customers with the right solution, delivered under the most demanding schedules with excellent outcome for our customers. As I have mentioned on earlier calls, our segment and subsidiary management teams are leading in an exceptional way and allocating resources in a thoughtful and pragmatic way. We continue to strive to optimize our project mix to produce great financial results. Our US Building Services segment continues its record of steady and impressive performance, and it has a strong mix of work across the service lines. This segment's revenues grew 13.3% in 2023 with an operating margin of 5.9%. Demand persists in our mechanical services division with excellent execution across retrofit projects, building controls and maintenance and repairs. We are working across a variety of end markets and our customers remain focused on energy efficiency and indoor air quality upgrades. The mechanical services business drove the robust performance of this segment in 2023 due in part to a strong repair service season this past summer as heat and humidity blanketed most parts of the country. The site [based] services division continues to deliver, entering into multiyear facility maintenance contracts to leverage our self perform operating model for skilled tradespeople and operating engineers. While opportunities for growth remain in this area, these facility services contracts take some time to ramp up. And the scope for these contracts can reduce, expand or be terminated over time and upon rebid. We have seen some contract degradations as the real estate facility providers are especially aggressive on price and scope on some of these contracts as they are struggling in their commercial real estate businesses. However, we will remain disciplined and not take any low price, low opportunity contracts. Our Industrial Services segment improved in 2023 and had sustained performance improvement over the last two years. Operating income improved by nearly 80% in the year, albeit from a low base. We had a more turn around seasons in 2023 and we had strong results from our niche services like heater repair. We are experiencing greater levels of capital spending within our shop services division in the form of increased new build heat exchanger orders and have benefited during the year from certain renewable fuel projects. We are just starting to see the resumption of demand for utility scale solar projects currently impacted by supply chain and permitting issues. Our Industrial Services and electrical team has us positioned well in the solar market and that position should continue to improve. Our UK segment performed in a manner consistent with the available market opportunities in 2023. The competition on some contracts is fierce as the UK economy is not strong. And similar to the US facility services market, we see the real estate companies bidding on contracts a bit aggressively due to weakness in the UK commercial real estate market. However, we have a normal base of facility services contracts, we'll build on that base and serve our customers well. And though we experienced a reduction in annual revenues in this segment, we are executing well as shown by the 5.9% operating margin for the year. Our balance sheet remains strong. It supports our organic growth and it provides us with the capital needed to expand our prefabrication capabilities, an investment in BIM, automation and robotics. We also have the firepower to continue to make strategic acquisitions, and I'm going to discuss that in more detail later. With that, Mark, I'm going to turn it over to you. Thanks, Mark. And I'm going to start on Page 12. We really could think of this, the way we talk about earnings is, we just talked about everything that happened in the past, and this next section is all about the future. And if you go to Page 12, we've talked about this chart probably about three quarters ago, we started talking about it. And I look at this as a resource allocation chart. It not only informs how we allocate resources to drive organic growth but this chart also informs our capital allocation decisions, which we'll talk about later. So if you think about this chart and moving left to right, and it will be some intermixing. The first part is the electrification EV value chain, it's a trend. And there's been a lot in the news lately about what's happening, is it stalling and all that. In our world, it's not right now, because of where we played. For us, it's mainly been about fire and life safety and utility scale charging stations, and now solar is starting to come back up on the radar. But the way I think about this, this is a major transformation, whether EVs and the electrification is 10% of vehicles, whether it's 15% of vehicles, whether it's is 30%. And clearly, the policy got a little ahead of the technology here, but that's okay. At the end of the day, all these facilities will be built. Some of them, the battery infrastructure is going to have to be built again, no matter what penetration it has. It's a lot more than it is today. And the utility scale charging stations that we participated in, these are at major hubs of transportation. And some of this is well underway, because it makes sense, especially for delivery vehicles and other things that have lighter weights. The solar is just starting to reengage in our part of the world and we do that mainly in electrical. We do that some in the electrical segment, some in the sub-utility scale in building services, and we'll talk about that later. But then at scale, we do it in industrial services through our electrical business there. We have great capability there. And it's also supported by the IRA and government incentives. And we are privileged to be able to either do that with union labor where applicable or we have the necessary prevailing wage experience and apprenticeship programs in the nonunion world to be able to do that. And you'll hear that theme across some of these trends. Then you get to the high tech manufacturing, look, mainly on electrification, EV value chain, pretty good market. What we're building we're going to continue to build. All big markets go through periods of up and down but the long term trend, I think, is intact. And again, whether it's 7%, 15% or 30%, there's a lot of facilities, a lot of utility scale charging that needs to happen. And if we just get a share of the solar market going forward, we'll see that in our Industrial Services segment. You go to high tech manufacturing, life sciences and you really got to look at this box and draw a little loop down to reshoring and near shoring. We learned in COVID that supply chains weren't as resilient as they should be. I don't think we learned that, we probably knew that. But we needed to have a lesson like that. So we're seeing our customers move their supply chains back onshore. This was happening even before COVID, because the wage differential versus the transportation and the uncertainty of transportation was not what it was, and automation allow you to make up for a lot of that wage differential. But you're really seeing it, the semiconductor manufacturing, which we're such a big part of, and we've expanded where we can do that. We only could do that in a couple of markets before. Now we can do that and double that number. So when we were two before, now we're 4 to 6. And that is, for us, weighted towards mechanical. But in electrical, we still do that work there in fire and life safety. So it represented all trades but weighted more towards mechanical, and you see that in our RPOs. And you go to pharma, biotech, life sciences, again, there's two things happening there. There's reshoring and we're in a lot of the right markets to make that happen, whether it's the Carolinas, parts of California, Indiana or New Jersey. But there's also an explosion of new drugs, specifically around weight loss. And new lines are being added, new capacity, and we're part of that. And you're also seeing in this high tech manufacturing life safety, nearshoring, is these major tech companies building hubs outside of Silicon Valley, whether it be in Research Triangle Park, Texas or Arizona. Again, places we're well positioned to take advantage of helping our customers. And again, you go to the government incentives, it's focused on getting skilled trade labor on the job that's trained the right way. We do that either through our union relationships or through skilled apprenticeship programs. And you have to understand how to work in a PLA, a prevailing wage world, we're expert at that. And our subsidiary CEOs, our segment leadership and our corporate leadership knows how to put the right parameters around that to make sure that we comply with what we told our customers were, so they qualify for the incentives that they want to receive. Then you move to the right, and again, part of that high tech manufacturing is driven by AI and data center buildout. Go to data centers, we're really good. And we've been really good at this for a long period of time. We started this back in the early 2000s. There was a little bubble up in 2010, '11. We kept that capability. And that leadership we have in our electrical and mechanical segments and some of our subsidiary leaders, they are world class specialty contractors and data centers as is our fire life and safety offering. So what's driving demand here? Driving demand is us, right? We want more and more service. We -- big companies like EMCOR is putting more and more things in the cloud, but also the proliferation of AI, and that needs more systems. These went from 5, 10, 15-megawatt facilities to 50, 80, 100 megawatt facility. So just put that in perspective, if you look at an office building or even a hospital complex, you look at a large hospital complex, that maybe is 5 to 10 megawatts. So think about what that one data center is using today to drive the things we need to be more productive or to outsource or get things into the cloud. Increased power requirements, then you're going to go back to the remodel of some of the data centers that were built to uplift the power in there and also have different kinds of server racks. So we not only participate on the front end, electrically and mechanically in fire and life safety, we also participate in, we call it the day two work, to allow it to receive the racking and then also finally in the retrofit and remodel. We've done a lot of work around these three top trends over the past year and half, two years to understand the long term trends. We feel pretty good about where we're positioned. Going down to healthcare, EMCOR has always been world class hospital builders. It's hard to go into a major city that we're in and not know that we weren't part of that healthcare skyline. Whether it's the Texas Medical Center in Houston, whether it's Massachusetts General and a whole hospital complex past Fenway in Boston, whether it's in San Diego, whether it's in Chicago, we're part of that healthcare skyline. And what we learned in COVID, those facilities need to be redone in many cases, also need to be made more flexible. And when you think about those healthcare facilities, they are rich, system complex environments. They don't look other than some of the high purity things, which an operating room is, a lot different than these high tech manufacturing and life science plants. There's a lot of commonality between that hospital build and high tech manufacturing. And that allows me to talk about what we do -- I talked about it and started, this was a resource allocation game at EMCOR and figuring out where the best opportunities for us to perform, perform well, keep our workers safe and productive and get superior results for our shareholders. And so a lot of the capabilities we've built across these different boxes, we can use in the different boxes. And that is the wonderful thing about our skilled trades, that's the wonderful thing about our supervision. And the engineering that we have at EMCOR, which is more design assist, value engineering people that designed to build, right? We figure out how to make it more buildable and that's what BIM and prefabrication have allowed us to do. And last but not least, you get the energy efficiency and sustainability. I don't think any of us sit here to say and say, oh, yes, I know energy prices are going down in the long term. That can't be true because you have an energy transformation going on, coupled with this great demand coming out of things like high tech facilities, data centers, the electrification, they use a lot of energy. So energy efficiency is also for owners and energy security, people are concerned about reducing their emissions, because it's not only in a lot of ways the right thing to do, it's the most cost effective thing to do over the long term. And nobody does that better than our EMCOR mechanical services businesses, in Building Services, also partly in our mechanical construction business. Yes, the lighting is good and all that, that's a given. But the complex things we can do around HVAC design and what we can do with building control systems, we do that world class. We are one of the leading applied building controls companies in the country, and we can deliver superior results for mechanical solutions for our customers. And we've expanded our ability to do that with some recent acquisitions to talk about water and waste reduction, talk about the building envelope as part of someone's else drive to get facilities rationalization and energy efficiency. Sometimes you'll see these things coupled with an alternative energy solution or a cogen solution, where they'll add solar, they'll add a cogen solution where you're taking steam and converting it into a cooling or you're converting it into power. We have folks in the field, we have great engineers they know how to do that, that work within the built space to drive great energy efficiency and superior results for our customers and reduce their energy needs. So I could stop there. We could stop talking about the future, but we're going to go now shift to Page 13 and talk about RPOs and how that page, Page 12, manifests itself into RPOs. I mean ultimately, great trends, but you don't know how to capitalize and turn it into projects, really doesn't mean a whole lot. So if you look on Page 13, you can see the impact of those major trends in our RPOs. Total company RPOs at the end of 2023 were over $8.8 billion, up almost $1.4 billion or almost 19% over the December 2022 total of $7.5 billion. Additionally, fourth quarter project bookings were strong with RPOs increasing $212 million from September 30, 2023. Domestic construction services RPOs stand at $7.3 billion, a record, up $1.3 billion from December 2022, in line with strong project demand across most of the market sectors in which we operate, and then we've seen that throughout the year. Building Services, which are anchored by energy efficiency projects and retrofit projects ends 2023 with a healthy project pipeline and also exemplified by almost $1.3 billion of RPOs. RPOs by market sectors are balanced end market segmentation, bridging back to the previous page of organic growth trends in the marketplace. Looking into the actual activity, high tech manufacturing, which includes semiconductor, pharma, biotech, life sciences, R&D and the electric vehicle value chain stands at $1.5 billion, up $686 million or 89% from year end 2022. Network and communications, which includes hyperscale data center work, stands at almost $1.6 billion, up $578 million or 59% from December 31, 2022. Healthcare project demand continues to be strong as we have over $1 billion in healthcare RPOs, which is primarily made up of new hospital construction or expansion projects. We also currently have RPOs of nearly $650 million in water and wastewater projects, which for us are predominantly located in Florida's Miami Dade County and also the West Coast of Florida from targeted projects from Tampa to Naples. Reshoring and nearshoring trends continue for our manufacturing and industrial customers reflected in $808 million in project RPOs. During the year, we also saw increases in transportation and short duration projects. Partially offsetting these RPOs were decreases in commercial, that's primarily driven by warehouse and hospitality projects. However, with respect to warehouses, we are seeing an uptick in activity for cold storage warehouses and upgrades in those cold storage warehouses for our fire and life safety services and projects as customers introduce more automation and change warehouse configuration. As the calendar moves into 2024, we continue to see strong multiyear growth characteristics in many of the market sectors we serve. Our scale and operational excellence sets us apart from others in the marketplace and make our operating companies some of the most capable partners for our customers. As the diversity in our RPOs demonstrates, we have the flexibility and capability to move across these sectors to address trends in the markets as they arise. As we progress through 2024, the pace and compositions of RPOs may change, based on the way our customers contract with us and become more familiar and part of their site build up. Once we are on a customer site frequently or sometimes subsequent portions of the project at the site are awarded in scopes of work that are smaller than the initial award. And second, supply chain issues and lead times are now being factored into the initial planning, thus avoiding the previous delay that led to some of the buildup in RPOs, especially in Building Services. With respect to capital allocation, which I'm going to show to you on Slide 14, our Board has approved an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.18 per share to $0.25 per share. We have a good acquisition pipeline and tend to use some of our firepower to execute deals. We recently signed definitive agreements to purchase a company in Texas and one in the Greater Atlanta area, both of which add capabilities to our mechanical construction segment. We also bought a company or signed an agreement for a company, which will be a bolt-on for our mechanical services division. We expect to send around $140 million in aggregate upfront purchase price in connection with these acquisitions. We expect to close these acquisitions as we move further into 2024. And we'll take the opportunity to expand our capabilities and increase our geographic reach to better serve our customers when we can purchase companies with the right skills and culture. We like our pipeline of deals, but as I always said, deals happen when they happen. Now let's turn to Page 15 and 16. Our exceptional performance in 2023 resulted in three meaningful guidance increases in 2023, as our operating margin strengthened throughout the year, primarily because we performed well and efficiently on difficult and complex projects, some of these projects had favorable contract terms. And what that really means is we don't get into protracted disputes with our customers. We work to finish the job together. And we had some outstanding disputes that we successfully resolved in 2023. As we set guidance for 2024, it is important to remember what I mentioned earlier at the start of this call. We're coming off a three year CAGR of nearly 28% and we had 65% growth in earnings per share this past year. We do expect to continue to grow earnings for our shareholders this year. For 2024, we will set guidance at $13.5 billion to $14 billion in revenues and $14 to $15 in diluted earnings per share. Our guidance assumes strong operating margin performance. Our guidance assumes strong operating margin performance. As previously discussed, we started the year with excellent RPOs in our electrical and mechanical construction segments, and a good base of RPOs in our mechanical services division within our US Building Services segment. However, we have nearly $300 million in revenue headwinds in the US and UK Building Services segment combined. They are coming from the result of loss of facility services contract that we lost on rebid despite strong customer scores on our service delivery. Despite this, we still expect low to mid single digit revenue growth in US Building Services. As reflected in our RPOs and as discussed previously, we continue to work and win work in important and strategic market sectors. We are executing our work with efficiency and precision as shown by our operating margins. We are utilizing BIM prefabrication in our labor and supply management capabilities with an eye towards delivering superior results for our customers and shareholders. However, as I stated in previous calls, it is important to remember that operating margins can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on mix, execution and timing of projects. We evaluate our operating margin performance in terms of ranges over quarters. And our performance in 2023 yielded operating margins for most of our segments, which were at or above the high end of our historical ranges, especially in our mechanical construction segment. We've shown great resilience in dealing with supply chain issues and continue to develop a strong bench performance through project managers to senior leadership. Further, we are attracting notable talent from skilled labor to senior project and operations management. Our outlook for 2024 is positive and for our ability to achieve the upper end of our guidance range, macroeconomic factors and other factors will come into play potentially. We remain concerned with the financial risk to some customers around continued elevated interest rates and also the macro uncertainties posed by the [Europe], the conflict and unrest in the Middle East and their impact on global energy markets and supply chains, as well as the dysfunction occurring in the US Government, which may lead to a government shutdown or the inability key pieces of legislation. We also realized that our customers adjust the scope and timing of long term projects, consistent with their immediate, intermediate and long term capacity needs. Despite these challenges, we believe that we will be able to navigate these uncertainties as we have as our team has shown great resiliency in the past. We remain cognizant of these external factors and the potential impact on our execution and performance. We're going to continue to be balanced capital allocators. Specifically, as discussed previously, there remain opportunities within our acquisition pipeline and we just increased our dividend -- quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share. We will continue to pursue opportunities to grow profitably, both organically and through acquisitions and our share repurchase program remains in place. As I've said before, with the uncertainty in the financial markets, we believe that our strong balance sheet helps us win work on large sophisticated projects as customers see our financial strength as just another reason to choose EMCOR. As always, I want to thank the entire EMCORE team for their dedication and hard work. We appreciate all you do every day for our customers. With that, I'll turn it over to you, Alan, to open the line for questions. Well, the better terms are mainly focused around liquidity in the project, right, cash flow, keep the project moving. And that wouldn't be an issue with us but we negotiate hard for those, because the better the cash flow on the project is typically the projects moving well. Secondarily, the better terms around, okay, if we're going to expand scope with the method for which we're going to expand scope, so we don't get into the change order discussions that are extended and really affect productivity. Some of it's around general conditions, the realization that we want people to have the right general conditions to be able to execute the project well. And finally, I think the better contractual terms around how things convert, whether they go from a fee based contract, GMP to a fixed price and what would be the mechanism to do that? You put all that together, yes, I think the larger the project right now, the more are those terms are favorable both for the owner and for us, because it's a clear eye view of how we're going to work together. No, that's basically it, coupled with the pace and timing of some of this large work, I mean times money, especially in the data center space. And as a result, you have to be a big sophisticated contractor that has the financial resources to mobilize on the site, being able to assemble a trained workforce with the right training on a job that might have been in planning, we get it, we may have a month and half to mobilize, within four months we're at full production and within nine months, some of these big data center jobs what we do on the -- the guts of it are done. And then if you go to the other side of that, if you're already at a significant semiconductor site or a EV site or even a health care facility, or any manufacturing site, there's a lot of work that has to get done initially to set the utility infrastructure and mobilize and get everybody to say, okay, we're going to be here. But then as they build the other parts of the site, add tooling, other things, you may get that in an award that will build to something almost the same size in chunks that are 15% to 20% of what you ultimately overdo on that scope. It hasn't been an impediment yet, Brent. We always say that we're always -- with an eye towards that, we've always had good success building it. The impediment actually we'll find the skilled tradespeople. It's how quickly we can develop foreman, how quickly we develop project managers to move from being someone that was helping on the job or was an assistant foreman to move up to run big work, likewise with project managers. We've also had pretty good success subtracting how we are winning, people like [indiscernible]. And we've also had pretty good success attracting skilled foreman and project managers from other parts of the country when we're building out some of these sites from other companies and also from other industries. We've always looked at cash flow. If you're earning at net income, it means the business is in pretty good shape, right? And if we're in the construction businesses, Jason, what do you think, 75%? Op income, that means our project portfolio is usually pretty good and that we don't have a lot of jobs that are eating cash, because they're in some form of dispute or they're delayed or anything. So when you're overperforming like we did this year versus operating, like Mark said, it's because specifically go to the mobilization we had on some of these big sites. We negotiate really hard upfront to make sure that we're not have a big cash drain as we mobilize on these sites, and sometimes that takes a long time to negotiate that. And also sometime we'll start on that, the one form of contract structure. And then over time, that contract structure will change from a fee based or T&M plus to more of a fixed price flow, because now we know what it costs to put labor on the site. We know the composition of the workforce, we're going to work force for the next three or four, or five years, hopefully. And then we know the owner and the GCs and the engineering firms we're going to work with how they get change orders down, how they get add moved. And so we have great folks on the ground that know this art. It's not a science, it's an art, and they do it really well. And they've a lot of experienced people help them quarterback that. And it's really the power of our corporate segment and subsidiary teams working together to bring that home on a site and to bring the cash flow home. Which gets you at net income or a little bit above. Does that make sense, Brent? Well, I think, Adam, with guidance out of $13.5 billion to $14 billion know that not all our revenues and RPOs but we feel pretty strongly that these other trends will continue through the year. As far as RPOs go, there could be fits and starts in the RPOs in some of these segments as work gets let. But we feel really good about Page 12 and the underlying drivers of our business and we think that we will continue to win. And the good news for us is we're balanced across market sectors. So as I talked about on Page 12, the skilled trade because these are complex projects and then when we share knowledge so well across our company on how to build and means and methods that our supervision can deploy that skilled trades on any number of industries once they get going. And that's been the strength of EMCORE over a long period of time and we expect it to continue to be so. So the short answer is -- I give you a shocking thing here, Adam. I think over the last seven, eight years, maybe a couple of mixed use buildings but as far as commercial skyscrapers where we were the core person doing the core building shell and everything else who was with that, not talking tenant fit out on commercial, I think we've built two, Mark, right, in 9 years now. We have one underway right now that's really a delayed project in 2017, and it's going fine. But that's not been the heart of EMCOR's business for a while. We still are big in the tenant fit out place, which where we operate, how we always like to say, we at EMCOR operate and earn in the Class A office space for tenant fit out and retrofits and everything and we occupy Class B and C space because of the nature of what we do. So where we operate we're fine, because that's still buoyant, a lot of movement, we're reconfiguring and figuring workspaces, new buildings. And then if you go to the other side of that, on the B&C space, quite frankly, it's not a bad time to be looking for space. No, I don't think... It's such an integral part of mechanical and how mechanical jobs thought about, and it's such a heart of our shops and everything. It would be hard to break out because it's ingrained in some of the companies and how they operate. That being said, it's an important part of our business. And it has a real success factor with our customers to deliver results on very complicated facilities across the country. Now that has some unique characteristics that make it on a trade delivery standpoint, it has a national union, right? Most trade businesses don't have a national union. Like the rest of the mechanical business, it's gravitated more towards prefab. Like the rest of the mechanical business, you have to have excellence in craft in the field and multidiscipline, they can do multisize pipe and really engineering. So it also has more of a design assist element as the rest of the mechanical business has gravitated towards. So that's why it's so integral to that mechanical business and it really wouldn't make sense to have it look different than the rest of the mechanical business. We've done a lot of work around it. We think it grows high single digits to mid teens for a while. So yes. Next 12 months? Good. I mean it's the next 12 months, we have most of it already in RPOs and we know what the work we'll be doing on some of these critical sites. When you think about the delays, actually, that's not bad for us in some cases. We're building the infrastructure around that, they have to staff them. It allows the sites to become much more after the initial build, they start to winnow down to the contractors that are the winners on that site that have done great work for them. On the sites that we are, we emphatically are those contractors. I don't really have -- we're contractors, we tend to look at things in three to five year cycles. And as we look at things over the next three to five years, we feel pretty good about that. Again, we can deploy our resources to the best opportunities. Secondarily, I give you a real world case. If someone comes in and the semiconductor market is going to be strong in a market we have our share of work or maybe we're not even playing in the semiconductor market in that market. The rest of the work that happened around, because it usually becomes a buoyant infrastructure that's part of that, whether it'd be warehousing, whether it'd be health care, the area tends to grow. We may do all those jobs and not do the semiconductor work. For us, it's a matter of resource allocation. How better serve the jobs and what the best opportunities are. Data center, I said, again, both and we look really strong for the next three to five years. I would say the data center business is a much more stable business and how they're going to staff it. Because they don't -- think about a data center, they have to get the technology right and a lot of them know how to do that and they're thinking of redesign. The data center human resource end of it is all on the construction side. The actual operating of the data center requires very few people. So once they get them up and running, it's much easier for them to think about capacity planning. Contrast that with the semiconductor world, you have -- some of them have established work forces in some of these markets. They have a much easier time thinking about expansion and growing. For someone that comes in knew it the first time, they may hire one and half workers to two workers for everyone that's going to stick with them on the production side. The construction side, there's a workforce that knows how to do that work after the first one. The construction folks aren't the issue. We would say that a -- I don't want to say slow down, a more thoughtfully planned next three or four phases on that. Once you get up and running leads to a more orderly construction site, we know how to work together and it goes on. We're all for them taking their time and getting them staffed correctly and becoming successful versus just build, build, build. It's better for us and our planning, it's better for them also. So bullish on both, data center does not have the human resource issue after the fact that semiconductors does. Thank you all. We look forward to hearing and working with you all in 2024. And with that, we now put a wrap on 2023."

I'm going to start on Pages 4 through 6. In my remarks, I will focus on the third quarter primarily, and Mark will speak in more detail on our quarterly and year-to-date results. At the end of my remarks, I will discuss some of the key drivers of our performance.  Today, we are announcing a series of record quarterly achievements, revenues, gross profit, operating income, operating income margin, diluted EPS and remaining performance obligations or RPOs. Driving this performance is strong end market demand for our services, especially in semiconductors, data centers, manufacturing, health care and retrofit projects. This demand, coupled with excellent execution, has produced outstanding results, not only a quarterly basis but also for year-to-date 2023.  For the third quarter, we earned $3.61 in non-GAAP earnings per diluted share on $3.21 billion in revenues. We grew revenues 13.5% overall with 12.8% organic revenue growth.  We had an adjusted operating margin of 7.4%, which is exceptional by any measure. However, I would like to remind you that margins can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on the mix, execution and timing of projects, most of which worked in our favor this quarter. Our operating cash flow for the third quarter was strong at $261 million, which represents over 100% operating income conversion. On a year-to-date basis, we generated $476 million in operating cash flow, which represents a conversion of 81%.  Our RPOs are an all-time high of $8.6 billion, which represents -- excuse me, represents 4.2% sequential growth from June 30, 2023, and 21.6% growth over the year-ago period. This was exceptional performance by an extraordinary team.  On a segment basis, we had excellent performance in our Electrical and Mechanical Construction and U.S. Building Services segment. The operating results of our Industrial Services segment continue to improve at a modest pace. And despite difficult economic conditions, our U.K. Building Services segment is reporting operating income and operating margin which is greater than a year-ago period.  The continued strength of our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments is evidenced by quarterly revenue growth of 10.1% and 19.9%, respectively. With Mechanical Construction operating margin of 10.4% and Electrical Construction operating margin of 9.1%, the conversion from revenue to operating income by these segments has exceeded our expectation.  We had excellent execution and great project mix. Across the country, we continue to complete some of the most sophisticated projects in markets such as the high-tech manufacturing sector, which includes semiconductors, the EV value chain, biotech, life sciences and pharmaceuticals, the EV value chain and the network and communications sector, which encompasses our data center work; the manufacturing sector, which is driven by reshoring and domestic capacity expansion as well as the healthcare sector. Our industry-leading capabilities in BIM, prefabrication, project planning and labor sourcing and the management of that labor and the training of that labor enable us to perform for our customers while also achieving superior financial returns. Our mechanical product offering is broad across applications such as HVAC, process, piping, plumbing and fire protection and fire life safety. We are operating in the key geographies where such projects are in process, and our fire life safety group has the capability to move across the country.  Our customers look to us to perform complex installations in the markets I just referenced. Our Electrical Construction team has deep expertise in the data center market as well as our Mechanical Construction team, which allows us to serve our customers with the right solution delivered under the most demanding schedules with excellent outcomes for our customers.  As I have mentioned on earlier calls, our segment and subsidiary management teams are leading in an exceptional manner. And they're allocating resources in a thoughtful and pragmatic way while working towards outstanding outcomes for our customers and for you, our shareholders, and that's how they produce these outstanding financial results. Our U.S. Building Services segment continues to perform well and has a strong mix of work across its service lines. The segment's revenues grew 13.7% in the third quarter with an operating margin of 7%.  Demand persists for our mechanical services with excellent execution across retrofit projects, building controls and maintenance and repairs. We are working across a variety of end markets, including traditional and high-tech manufacturing. And our institutional and commercial customers remain focused on energy efficiency and IAQ upgrades. We did experience a strong repair service season because of the heat that blanketed most parts of the country over this past summer. The Mechanical Services business is driving the robust performance of the segment on a quarterly and year-to-date basis, and the overall trends for this business remain positive. The site-based services division continues to deliver entering into multiyear facility maintenance contracts to leverage our self-perform operating model for skilled trades people and operating engineers. As a result, there continues to remain areas of growth in this -- there continue -- remains opportunities for growth for this service line. However, these contracts take some time to ramp up. And scope for these contracts can expand, reduce or return [indiscernible] over time and upon rebid.  Our Industrial Services segment continues to improve at an expected pace. It is important to remember that the third quarter is typically a weak quarter for field services, contributing to the near breakeven operating income reported by this segment this quarter.  We anticipate executing a fall turnaround season that is comparable to the prior year, and demand for our new services is robust. We are experiencing increased levels of capital spending, which then drives demand in our shop services division in the form of greater new build heat exchange orders. We continue to wait for the resumption of demand for utility scale solar projects, which continues to be affected by supply chain issues. And we are well positioned to perform such projects when these issues subside.  Our U.K. business continues to perform in a manner consistent with the available market opportunities. Building on its normal base of facility services contracts, EMCOR U.K. continues to perform various project work for its customers. Much of that work is aimed at helping them develop and implement multiple multiyear energy reduction programs. Although we experienced a reduction in quarterly revenues within this segment, we are executing well as shown by the 8% operating margin during the quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong, supporting both our organic growth and the capital needed to invest in such growth, whether through expanding our prefabrication capabilities or investment in BIM, automation and robotics. We also have the firepower to make bolt-on acquisitions that help us expand our capabilities in support of our customers. Great quarter.  And Mark, I'll let you talk about the rest of it.\nMark Pompa: Great. Thank you, Tony, and good morning to everyone participating on the call today. We are now on Slide 7 for those of you who are accessing this presentation via the webcast. Over the next several slides, I will augment Tony's opening commentary on EMCOR's third quarter performance as well as provide a brief update on our year-to-date results through September 30. All financial information referenced this morning is derived from our consolidated financial statements included in both our earnings release announcement and Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier today. So let's revisit and expand our review of EMCOR's third quarter performance.  Consolidated revenues of $3.21 billion are up $381.2 million or 13.5% over quarter 3 2022. Each of our domestic reportable segments experienced revenue growth during the third quarter. Excluding $20.4 million of revenues attributable to businesses acquired pertaining to the time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in last year's quarter, revenues for the third quarter of 2023 increased 12.8% when compared to the third quarter of 2022.  Before reviewing the operating results of our individual reporting segments, I would like to reiterate what Tony highlighted earlier that our $3.21 billion of quarterly revenues represents a new all-time quarterly revenue record for the company and eclipses the previous record set during the second quarter. The specific to each of our reportable segment's third quarter revenue performance is as follows. United States Electrical Construction segment revenues of $697.4 million increased $64 million or 10.1% from quarter 3 2022. Excluding incremental acquisition revenues, this segment's revenues grew 8.1% organically quarter-over-quarter. Consistent with its second quarter performance, the segment continues to experience revenue growth across most of the market sectors that they serve. Such quarterly revenue growth was most prevalent within the network and communications, healthcare, manufacturing and industrial and hospitality and entertainment market sectors.  Revenues of our United States Mechanical Construction segment of $1.33 billion increased $221 million or a strong 19.9% from the year-ago period. This revenue growth continues to be driven by increased activity within the high-tech manufacturing, traditional manufacturing, network and communications and commercial market sectors. Consistent with its performance during the first 6 months of the year, this segment is experiencing growth in both fire and life safety as well as traditional mechanical services. Increased demand is stemming from customer projects supporting the design and manufacturing of semiconductors as well as the production and development of electric vehicles and/or related battery technologies. This, in conjunction with further data center development opportunities as well as the domestic reshoring of critical supply chain by certain of our customers are all contributing factors to the Mechanical Construction segment, establishing a new all-time quarterly record of revenue during the third quarter. Our combined United States construction revenues of $2.03 billion increased $285 million or 16.4%, crossing the $2 billion quarterly revenue threshold for the first time and establishing a combined all-time quarterly revenue record for construction services. United States Building Services revenues of $817.7 million increased $98.3 million or 13.7%, representing a new all-time quarterly revenue record for this segment. Excluding incremental acquisition revenues, the segment's revenues grew 12.6% organically. Revenue growth was experienced across each of the 3 divisions with the largest contribution coming from mechanical services. Specifically, we benefited from an increase in HVAC project and retrofit revenues due to increased availability of equipment and materials when compared to 2022, which faced greater supply chain delays. There also continues to be strong demand for certain of the segment's service offerings as our customers seek ways to improve the energy efficiency and/or indoor air quality of their facilities. Lastly, both the segment's commercial and government site-based services divisions experienced incremental project revenues in the third quarter of the current year as a result of new customer additions or scope and site expansion with existing customers. EMCOR's Industrial Services segment revenues of $252.2 million increased $4.9 million or 2% quarter-over-quarter. Although not as substantial as the revenue growth of our other domestic reporting segments, we are pleased by the trend of period-over-period growth that this segment has achieved the last few years despite the sustained headwinds within the oil and gas industry. Contributing to the growth in the current quarter was a resumption of capital spending by several of our customers in the form of increased new build heat exchanger orders as well as certain renewable fuel projects. United Kingdom Building Services segment revenues of $110.7 million represents a reduction of $7 million or 5.9% from last year's third quarter. The period-over-period revenue decline is a result of the nonrenewal of certain facilities maintenance contracts, which were still active in 2022 as well as the reduction in project activity as certain of this segment's customers have slowed their capital spending programs in light of the macroeconomic headwinds within the United Kingdom. Please turn to Slide 8. Reported operating income for the quarter was $235 million or 7.3% of revenues and favorably compares to $150.1 million of operating income or 5.3% of revenues a year ago. Consistent with my revenue commentary and Tony's opening remarks, the current quarter's consolidated operating income and operating margin each represent new all-time quarterly records for EMCOR.  Included within our reported operating income is a small impairment charge of $2.4 million related to certain long-lived assets within our United States Mechanical Construction segment. On an adjusted basis, if such impairment charge was excluded, third quarter 2023 non-GAAP operating income would be $237.3 million or 7.4% of revenues. Specific operating performance by segment is as follows. Our U.S. Electrical Construction segment earned operating income of $63.1 million, an increase of $27.6 million from the comparable 2022 period. The reported operating margin of 9.1% represents a significant increase from the 5.6% reported in last year's third quarter. Exceptional project execution, which Tony previously commented from each of our operating companies, coupled with a favorable revenue mix when compared to the 2022 period were the primary drivers of this performance. Such improved execution is demonstrated by a reduction of project write-downs as compared to last year's third quarter where certain discrete write-downs totaled $10.5 million and negatively impacted this segment's 2022 operating margin by 170 basis points.  Besides a reduction in write-downs, this segment's operating income and operating margin for the third quarter of 2023 benefited from the successful closeout of certain projects, which positively impacted its operating margin in the quarter by 60 basis points. Third quarter operating income of our U.S. Mechanical Construction segment of $138.5 million represents a $48 million increase from last year's quarter and operating margin of 10.4% represents 220 basis points of improvement from 2022's third quarter. Growth in both gross profit and gross profit margin due to a more favorable revenue mix, including a higher percentage of self-performed projects, were the most significant contributors to this overall improved performance. Additionally, in the Mechanical segment's operating income and operating margin for the quarter benefited from the successful closeout of certain projects, which resulted in 40 basis points of incremental operating margin. Operating income for U.S. Building Services is $57.2 million or 7% of revenues and compares to $46 million or 6.4% of revenues in 2022's third quarter. Similar to the growth in the segment's revenues, the increases in operating income and operating margin were driven by the segment's Mechanical Services division. Notably, we experienced favorable project execution of HVAC projects and retrofits as well as incremental building automation and controls activity. Our U.S. Industrial Services segment incurred an operating loss of approximately $200,000, which compares favorably to an operating loss of $1.4 million in last year's third quarter. As I have referenced in prior years and consistent with Tony's comment, quarter 3 is historically our Industrial segment's weakest quarter. However, we are encouraged by the trend of quarterly improvement within this segment, and we remain ready to assist our customers as they execute their maintenance and capital spending programs. U.K. Building Services operating income of $8.9 million or 8% of revenues represents an increase of $500,000 and a 90 basis point improvement in operating margin. The performance of this segment is impressive considering the reduction in quarterly revenues previously discussed and demonstrates the strength of its portfolio of facilities maintenance contracts.  We are now on Slide 9. Additional financial items of significance for the quarter not addressed on the previous slides are as follows. Quarter 3 gross profit of $545.5 million represents an all-time quarterly gross profit record for the company and is higher than the comparable 2022 quarter by $132.2 million or 32%. And gross margin of 17% has improved 240 basis points. Selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately $308.1 million represent 9.6% of revenues and reflect an increase of $45 million from quarter 3 2022. SG&A for the current year's quarter includes approximately $4.2 million of incremental expenses from businesses acquired inclusive of intangible asset amortization, resulting in an organic SG&A increase of $40.8 million. This quarter's organic growth in SG&A was due to incremental expense pertaining to incentive compensation programs across the majority of our reportable segments. This is due to higher operating results to date when compared to the prior year as well as our revised profitability projections for full year 2023, which have necessitated our third upward revision in our annual earnings guidance. Tony will speak to our revised guidance range in detail following the conclusion of my commentary. Besides incentive compensation, we have experienced quarter-over-quarter growth in our personnel costs due to our continued double-digit organic revenue growth, which has necessitated increased headcount to support our back office and contract administration functions coupled with annual cost of living increases for our existing workforce. We have also experienced an escalation in occupancy costs due to inflationary pressures in the real estate market. Diluted earnings per common share in the third quarter of 2023 is $3.57 as compared to $2.16 per diluted share for the prior year period. On an adjusted basis, excluding the impact of the previously mentioned long-lived asset impairment charge, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $3.61, which represents a $1.45 or 67.1% increase when compared to the $2.16 reported in last year's quarter. As Tony mentioned in his introductory remarks, our third quarter diluted EPS performance on either a GAAP or non-GAAP basis represents a new all-time record for EMCOR by a large margin.  Please turn to Slide 10. With the quarter commentary complete, I will touch on some highlights with respect to our results for the first 9 months of 2023. Revenues of $9.14 billion represent an increase of $1.02 billion or 12.5%, of which 11.3% was generated from organic activities.  Operating income of $586.6 million or 6.4% of revenues represents a 51.3% increase from the results for the first 9 months of 2022. We have experienced improved operating income and operating margin in each of our domestic reporting segments.  Our year-to-date diluted earnings per share was $8.85, which compares to $5.50 in the corresponding 2022 period. Adjusting the current year to include the previously referenced impairment loss results in a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $8.88. Comparing this adjusted number to last year's reported EPS represents an improvement of 61.5% year-over-year. With substantial growth in our year-to-date net income plus the reduction in weighted average shares outstanding due to our share repurchases, EMCOR has been able to generate significant EPS growth. We are now on Slide 11. EMCOR's balance sheet maintains its strength and liquidity. And we continue to be well positioned to fund organic growth, return capital to shareholders and pursue strategic M&A opportunities. Fluctuations of note when compared to December of 2022 are as follows. Cash on hand increased by just over $67 million. Our exceptional operating cash flow was partially offset by cash used for financing activities of $276.2 million, given a repayment of $142.8 million on our term loan and just over $105 million for the repurchase of our common stock as well as cash used for investing activities of $134 million as a result of capital expenditures and acquisitions to date. Resulting primarily from our organic growth during the period, our working capital balance has increased by nearly $128 million. The $34.2 million increase in goodwill is entirely a result of the 7 acquisitions completed by us thus far in 2023 while net identifiable intangible assets have increased by $6.8 million as the additional intangible assets recognized in connection with such acquisitions were partially offset by $49 million of amortization expense in the first 9 months of the year. Total debt, exclusive of operating lease liabilities, has decreased by $143.2 million, almost entirely as a result of the previously mentioned $142.8 million voluntary principal payment made on our term loan. Our stockholders' equity balance has increased by $305.7 million as our net income for the 9-month period exceeded our share repurchases and dividend payments to date in 2023. EMCOR's debt to capitalization ratio has reduced to 4.4% from 11.1% at year-end 2022, given the reduction in borrowings under our credit agreement as well as the increase in stockholders' equity just referenced. With my prepared commentary for the third quarter now completed, I would now like to return the call back to Tony. Tony?\nAnthony Guzzi: Thanks, Mark. And I'm going to be on -- thanks, Mark. I'm going to be on Page 12. And look, we put this page in the last time, and we really got a lot of great feedback from our investors. And I like this page because it really talks about what's driving our business from a macro level and a micro level because there's some micro drivers in here.  And these opportunities on this page is really what's driving our organic growth. It's been very strong. I mean, when you think about 12.8% organic growth in the quarter, you say what's driving that? It can't just be business as usual to do that.  So if you go on this page, we're going to go left to right across the top of the box and then start over again on the bottom and go left to right, and we'll draw interconnections where appropriate. Let's talk about electrification in the EV value chain. We, as a management team, have done a lot of work around energy transition and the thought process behind it. I think we -- I know I personally landed on, this is not just an energy transition. It's an energy expansion because if you really want to fund other than the bottom-right box the rest of these things, you need more energy.  And -- but we're going to have to do it not with just traditional sources. We're going to have to do it with traditional sources, renewable sources. There's going to be a lot of investment. There is a lot of investment. On the transition side, some of that investment has been held up by supply chain. That's not going to break easily, right, because things like transformers, inverters. You hear a lot about the panels, but the other ones are just supply chain issues where things have been pushed out 18 to 36 months for some products. But there's a lot of work going on around transition and to be prepared about that transition. Where we're going to play in that is supporting some of that transition. And then also on the electric vehicle and battery plant construction, there's a lot of discussion around this. So at the highest level, this trend right now is probably impacting our current results less than any of the other trends that you see on this page. But it is a trend that will impact our results. We're also going to be a user of some of these transition vehicles, right, whether they be hybrids or whether they be battery powered over time. So we're going to be in the construction, the supply chain of those plants that are going to support the EV plants and then also the battery plant construction. EMCOR has always been very careful of how we service the automotive sector, and we'll continue to be so. Right now, this is an electrical and fire life safety and fire protection opportunity for us, but it will expand beyond that. We do expect there to be more utility grade the way we think about it, massive number of charging stations at one location. We've done some of that and some of the big warehouses that have been built. But we haven't seen that proliferation yet, but we expect to -- for a lot of the last-mile delivery, a lot of these mass charging stations make a lot of sense. They're also supported by government incentive. So you sort of separate the noise of what's going on today, there's going to be a slower pickup. A lot of the things we do along this are for the infrastructure that's going to allow things that happen at a later date. And again, it's the box of all of these that's impacting our current results the least. You go in to say high-tech manufacturing, life sciences, and you got to sort of drag that bottom-middle box up into it because it's also a reshoring, nearshoring issue. We are very active in the semiconductor space, and we're in a lot of the right markets, both mainly mechanically but somewhat electrically in fire protection in the mechanical business as well as just straight mechanical work. And in some cases, we operate on the clean side, the high-purity piping and other places, we're doing both. We're doing the -- we call it the dirty side, but as far from dirty, it's the infrastructure to support that semiconductor plant. We're also doing some of the low-voltage offerings, and we have a pretty robust position in fire life safety and fire protection in those semiconductor plants. And then there's a whole ecosystem around those semiconductor plants that's built to support those semiconductor plants. And in that case, we're doing some of that work, but those are actually more significant maintenance opportunities for us versus semiconductor plants. On the pharma, biotech, life sciences, we are seeing it. We're seeing it in 2 ways. One is the reshoring, and we're seeing it also in the expansion of opportunity, right? These weight loss drugs are causing whole new plants to be built. And that's especially true in some of the hubs where we're most effective, whether that be New Jersey, Research Triangle Park or out into Southern California. And that links to nearshoring, especially for some of the plants that are being built to break the dependence on China and even India for pharmaceutical compounds. Government incentives continue to support that momentum, especially on the semiconductor side, but a lot of that was happening. What the government incentives will do is to elongate that cycle and bring more surety to that demand.  When you get to data centers and connectivity, this is something we're pretty good at, right, both mechanically, electrically and fire protection, life safety. We're good at it. And so the demand drivers are -- they've been ubiquitous, and then AI just adds another boost to it.  So go back to that first box, where we talked about electrification and energy transition. A data center uses a lot of power up to 50 to 100 megawatts. So to put that in perspective, 5,000 homes use less than 200 megawatts, and they use it intermittently. A data center is using 60 to 100 megawatts. So half of what 5,000 homes would do, it has to be continuous. It has to be clean. It has to be pure. And so if you think about that and then you think about where they're being built, we're in really good shape, both mechanically and electrically. I'd say we do data center construction as good as anybody in the country for those specialty trades and we're linked with the right customers.  And there, you're also thinking about how you make them better for the owner, how you get the schedule quicker and how you continue to drive all across the top here, prefabrication, BIM, to allow a solution to be ready to be built. And we're always thinking about the value add we can do with design assist to help them get to the best cost solution for their data center needs.  Great team here. We're active in about 5 or 6 markets. And we continue to look opportunities to support our customers, both from the GC and construction manager side but also the 5 major end owners that use these data centers.  You get to healthcare, this is a market we've seen rebound since COVID. It's always been a good market for us because all the things that make those top boxes complicated, complicated systems, lots of systems coming together is true in a hospital between the med gases, the electrical, the backup generation, the power quality monitoring, the building control systems.  Think about what goes into hospital. And that even goes beyond the hospitals we're trying to make more flexible, but also the outpatient facilities get more sophisticated every day. And it's in those hospitals and outpatient facilities. We also see an aftermarket opportunity that require the kind of services we offer, both with our mechanical services function, our aftermarket fire life safety business and also our site-based services.  To get to reshoring, nearshoring, I'd go from the bottom up, there automation is allowing industries even beyond what we talked about to be reshored. And they have to, right? We used -- we went from a world where multiple suppliers, multiple plants, it's one supplier, multiple plants. So we got into a really bad place in our supply chain, not us EMCOR, right? We buy other people's stuff of one plant supplying, and that might be in China and people aren't comfortable with that. And so COVID brought that to a head. People were thinking about it beforehand. We've been investing in being able to support those customers for 10 years now. So you're seeing a lot of capacity shifting across a range of industries from tire manufacturing to other automotive manufacturing, auto parts manufacturing to textiles even coming back through automation. So a host of industries are returning and they're doing it to do not only -- I would say, it's capacity hardening and expansion. And finally, one of my favorites because I've been around it for 25 years is energy efficiency and sustainability around that energy efficiency. And we are known for what we do in HVAC control system and lighting retrofits. When we bought ECM, they have that capability, too, but they also have water reduction capability. And it's something as simple as how you fix the faucets, how you use smart plumbing facilities -- plumbing fixtures. And that can have a big impact.  It's also helping our customers with their facilities footprint adjustment rationalization. It's making sure that folks can get the right utility rebates. It's adding in not on these massive utility scale solar or utility scale combined heat and power but local decentralized distributed generation.  These are typically things that are 1 megawatt or less that can help shave the load but also provide more energy security and energy reduction when combined together with an HVAC or lighting or control system retrofit. There's government incentives. There are utility incentives. Our folks are expert of that. And we've carved out a niche in that market of not only doing the work directly for the owners, but also supporting just about all the ESCOs as they bring their solutions to life.  And with that, I'm going to turn to Page 13 and sort of tie that into our RPOs on this page. Like we've said, this will show up by segment and market sector. We have great RPOs right now at $8.6 billion, right? That's a big level. It's up $1.5 billion from where we were in the year-ago period. And when they were $7.1 billion, we're pretty happy about that a year ago.  Additionally, the third quarter bookings were strong with RPOs increasing almost $350 million from June, which was 1 -- anyway, you look at that, that's about a 4% sequential increase. Each of our 5 segments saw RPO growth in third quarter from the year-ago period. Domestic construction services RPO, which includes fire protection life safety projects are up over $1.3 billion in line with strong project demand that we've seen all year. Building services, which are anchored by that energy efficiency box and other retrofit box we talked before. So our RPOs increased 16% over last year's third quarter.  RPOs by market sector tied back to the organic growth trends I talked on the previous page. If you zeroing on the actual activity, high-tech manufacturing, which includes those things, semiconductors, pharma, biotech, life sciences, R&D and the electric vehicle value chain, they're up $716 million or 113% from the year-ago period.  Network and communication, which includes our hyperscale data center work and our low voltage work stands at $1.4 billion. That's up 40% from third quarter of last year. We have over $1 billion in healthcare market sector RPOs as the hospital industry and the medical surgical patient industry continues to reshape post-pandemic. And they're also responding to demographic trends. We've discussed nearshoring and nearshoring and manufacturing. You see some of that in that high-tech manufacturing, but just traditional manufacturing, the way we think about it is up 30% year-over-year.  RPOs also grew in the water and wastewater. We've talked about that before in institutional, and that's up 29%. And that's really for us, focused on the water and wastewater side in Florida, where we have great capability in that growing state that struggles to keep up with demand with infrastructure. If you're offsetting this increase, we've had some reduction in commercial, but it's not what you think. It's warehouse projects. We're very active a year ago, especially with our fire protection and life safety but also our electrical. That's down. You'd expect that to be down right now. There's been a lot of build there. The cold storage is still pretty good as well as the transportation market sector that tends to be very episodic for us. And that will come back at some point, but it's not what's driving our results today. We're well positioned in the sectors with strong growth characteristics.  So to get ahead of you and your questions both for later in this call and also when you call us later to reiterate what we said on this call, we like our market mix, our contract mix and our margin mix and our RPOs. Now we've got to go execute. And hopefully, that all stays on track and scope doesn't expand and all that. I mean, all that sort of came together for us this quarter, but we do like our mix and backlog. If you go now, I'm going to be on Pages 14 to 16 to wrap this up. We've had exceptional performance this year. We had last year, too. And we're going to have another meaningful guidance increase. This results from favorable demand in strong end markets, coupled with excellent execution, strong project mix and timing and really a general absence of badness. We are raising our diluted EPS guidance based on our strong third quarter and year-to-date performance from a range of $10.75 to $11.25 to a range of $12.25 to $12.65 on a non-GAAP basis. We will also revise our revenue guidance. Approximately $12.5 billion. Now we had a range from $12 billion to $12.5 billion, we're going to be $12.5 billion now.  As reflected in our RPOs and as discussed previously, we continue to win work in important strategic market sectors. We are executing our work with efficiency, discipline and precision as shown by our record operating margin. We are utilizing technology in BIM, prefabrication. And we're doing a great job managing our labor and managing our supply chain. And we do all this with delivering -- an eye toward delivering great results for our customers first and as a result, we deliver for you, our shareholders.  As I stated earlier, it is important to remember that margins can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on the mix execution and timing of projects. We evaluate our margin performance, our operating margin performance in ranges, and we've talked about that over a period of time. And our performance in the current quarter has yielded margins, operating margins at or above the high end of our historical ranges.  Our team has shown great resilience in dealing with supply chain issues. They're still there. Lead times are terrible. And we continue to develop a strong bench from foreman to project managers to senior leadership. Further, we continue to attract notable talent from skilled labor through senior project and operations management.  However, there are always things you need to consider and be prudent. We do remain concerned with the financial risk to our customers around higher interest rates and macro uncertainties posed by the Ukraine war, the war between Hamas and Israel, turmoil in the oil and gas markets, which will only get worse from those things and the dysfunction occurring in the U.S. government, which may lead to a government shutdown or the inability to fund key pieces of legislation. Additionally, while we do not believe the UAW strike will significantly impact us or our current projects, it may slow the release of future work within the EV value chain. Despite these challenges, we believe that we will be able to navigate them as we have in the past. Our team has always shown great resiliency. However, we do need to remain cognizant of these external factors and the potential impact on our execution and performance. We're going to continue to be balanced capital allocators. There continues to be opportunity within our acquisition pipeline. And with uncertainty in the financial markets, we believe that our strong balance sheet helps us win work on large, sophisticated projects as customers see our financial strength as just another reason to choose EMCOR. As always, I want to thank our entire EMCOR team for their dedication and hard work. We appreciate all you do every day for our customers first at EMCOR. With that, Betsy, I'll take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question today comes from Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson.\nBrent Thielman: Tony, maybe just coming back to Slide 12, when you think about -- you talked to the customers that comprise the markets that are all embedded in that slide. What do you think is the sensitivity to this interest rate environment? Because at this point, it doesn't seem like there's much.\nAnthony Guzzi: I would agree with you. We haven't seen it in our bidding or our opportunities. I think if you're going to see it anywhere, right, you'll see it in places that have the most far-out opportunity and the most strain on balance sheets. There's probably better people than me to talk about where that will be. But really, I think we see pretty good demand across most of these. And I think that it'll important, Brent, I think part of what you're driving at is what you typically see as some of this work unfolds after the initial activity comes on a site is, in general, projects then get let in smaller amounts, right, because we're there.  And we're working with them to develop the add-on work and the next scope. So I think there's great demand in there yet. I think these are really good drivers, but nothing is literally up and to the right, right? There's always a little jags along the way. We haven't seen that recently, but history would say that, that will, in fact, happen. But the underlying drivers of this over a 5-year period should continue to be pretty strong.\nBrent Thielman: Yes. Okay. And the profitability of the business group is obviously a real standout, Tony. I hear you, the mix of business can have an impact in any given quarter on the margin. When you think about some of these kind of prevailing markets like data center or kind of large-scale manufacturing projects, healthcare, I mean, all of these require a certain level of technical capabilities that you guys have. Is that what you're referring to in terms of mix? And I guess why wouldn't that sustain going forward?\nAnthony Guzzi: Yes. I think it's mix, but also contractual terms. Mark's talked about that, and I've talked about this in the past. The same project could be done, some of them may change their contractual terms because they haven't developed the scope, they think they should. So we'll maybe getting a GMP environment instead of a fixed price environment because that's going to protect us the most or we may get in an environment where the design wasn't frozen. We haven't been able to get design assist. And as a result of that, profitability can be delayed, right, Mark, because we'll -- the way the change orders get booked.  So they can be a little chunky along the way. But clearly, where we do the best is when we know the work, we can do a fixed price contract, and we have more control of the schedule.\nMark Pompa: Yes. And Brent, the only thing I would add to Tony's comment with regards to mix is clearly scope of services. Tony has commented in past calls that the last couple of years, we've seen fairly sizable growth in our fire protection and life safety services. That work tends to have a better profitability profile than traditional mechanical services. Additionally, a lot of the work we're performing now, a lot of the equipment that we're installing is being procured by our customers. If more of the equipment scope comes back into our future work, the mark-up we get on equipment is certainly less than we get on our labor.  So that ultimately can impact margins when you're looking at them on a comparative period. It's still very good work. Certainly welcome the opportunity to perform all scope for our customers. But certainly, it changes the project profitability characteristics from a margin perspective.\nAnthony Guzzi: Yes, and building on that, right? We -- at the profitability levels we're at, we are much more focused on margin dollars right now than we are margin percentages and the growth they're in. And we don't control necessarily how people decide to let contracts and what that contract structure could be. The other thing along that, that I would add is, one of the changes that's happened in the market, and I don't see this changing, Brent. If you go back 10, 12 years on some of these jobs, what people would have tried to do is they would have tried to take these projects and break them up into small pieces as they can, which causes massive coordination issues on the job and that allows more contractors to bid. So there's a couple of things that have happened, right? With the rise of BIM even more ubiquitous and more complicated, coupled with the demand for prefabrication because it's the best way to get labor efficiency and reduce the need for craft labor on a job because they have plenty of work to do anyway, that it's much more difficult to do that. And so you're really looking for sophisticated contractors to be part of the team earlier, and you're working together to develop the best solution for the customer where before that we might have not got involved till 70%, 80%, 90%, a lot of times we're getting involved 40% to 60%, and we're not completing design. What we're doing is completing the design for constructability with design assist. And that makes a big difference about what kind of people we're working with and who they can work with.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. Very good. I guess my last question, I mean, your optimism here is duly noted, Tony. I guess any qualitative commentary you can offer for us on the outside looking in and how to think about the business into 2024? There's a lot of interesting drivers here. You expect the company to grow. I mean, anything that you can say about 2024 at this stage being a couple of months away here?\nAnthony Guzzi: Yes. I mean we never give 2024 guide. You know that, and you're not asking for that. Actually, you're asking what's the external environment and how that could shape the environment we compete in.  Look, I think energy markets remain really uncertain. And all of the energy -- when I [indiscernible] sort of the wrong word, all the anxiety that we felt at the start of the Ukraine war, if this horrible situation in Israel becomes even more expanded and more difficult through the rest of the Middle East, it's going to have a similar or worse effect than what that Ukraine issue did on energy markets.  And so that could be a real issue, right, not only for us, right, as it's consumer of energy, we buy a lot of gasoline and diesel, but in the place that could happen therein, but also sort of what it does to global supply chains and the uncertainty around shipping. I mean, all of the things that come with that, right?  I also think that the other thing that could sort of dampen -- again, I don't think it dampens, right? We're sitting here with $8.6 billion of RPOs off of a $7.1 billion a year ago print, which I think even then was up 30% from the previous year. So we have good momentum in RPOs.  So it is what people's conviction going to be around sort of capital investment if inflation its ugly head because of labor costs and other people have or other things. So there's some macro indicators out there.  Interest rates, in my mind, aren't going down. I think that's what our team believes here. We're going to run our balance sheet very prudent. But for those that are more extended, right, there's a lot of people with a lot of debt out there. And as those debts come to maturity, that could have an impact.  But again, go back to our boxes and you think of our customers that are driving this right now. Data center customers, whether they be in build for use, which is one part of the market or those big customers are doing it themselves, they have cash, and they continue to generate cash.  They're not dependent on financing. Semiconductors because of who they are and who they're funded by even without our government funding are fairly good with cash. There, it's going to be a matter of as they commission the first fabs on these sites, what have they learned as they go to the second one, there could be delays. There always is. That could be an issue, right? So those customers are more cash rich. The pharma company is the same. Healthcare looks pretty healthy right now. They have a need to be able to put hospitals in the market, right? They just don't build a hospital. Someone has to tell them there's a certificate of need for you to build that hospital in this market and especially in markets where the demographics are shifting to, we continue to see that.  And then there's old hospitals, right? We're doing work at Mass General right now, great hospital but outdated facilities that they're rebuilding, and we're thrilled to be part of that. And so I feel good about it. If you're going to see it anywhere, you might start to see it in some of the energy efficiency work we do for our commercial customers. But they're going to be caught between things, right? Because if they don't make their buildings more energy efficient, they become harder to lease.  So there's a lot going on there. I feel pretty good about where we're at. But I think, in general, there could be some -- you see it in the warehousing, you'll probably see in retail something we don't serve very much is where you'll really see it, and then you'll get it with people with strained balance sheet, some of these private equity-owned assets that have a lot of debt on them.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson, Davis.\nAdam Thalhimer: Welcome, Andy. Look forward to meeting you. Actually, Tony, can I just keep going on your PE comment? Are you seeing them show up less on M&A opportunities? Finally...\nAnthony Guzzi: No, not with the kind of deals we do. I think they look at the size we like to do $50 million to $200 million, I think they say, hey, there's a place we can put all equity. And the earth and heavens will come together, and we'll be able to finance this at a lower rate in the next 18 months. So we don't believe that. That's clearly what they believe.  So no, the answer is no. We really don't compete against them a lot. I mean, if someone really wants to go to PE, we're probably out in the first round anyway, we -- to get the great cultural fit and really understand the management team and it is a management team that's going to be there for the long term, sometimes that's not a great fit.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. All right. I'm going to try to do this, going to ask a 3-part question. On RPOs, one, is there a point where you feel like you're too full? Two, are you starting to book jobs further out? And three, do you think some of the RPO growth is market share gains?\nAnthony Guzzi: Yes. So I'll take the third one. I don't even think about market share, never have. Such a big market that 19 years, more 30 years, got 30 years, you guys ever look at market share? So you can take that one away. We don't think about it. We wouldn't know how to answer that question. Massive market, we're a small part of it.  Second one, are we too full? That becomes a question of what's the project, what's the size of the project, what's the timing of that project. So here's how I think about that.  Our governor has less to do with how we'll be able to fill skilled craft and technical labor. We'll find that. We've always found -- and we're a really great place to work. We've done a really good job staying ahead of the development of foreman and project managers. And then where we don't have them developed, being able to hire really good people from the outside. So if there's a slowdown in RPO, it's not because we don't think we can develop them. It's just the mix [indiscernible] right, these things come episodically. Rarely do you see a run like we've had over the last 2.5 years where RPOs just consistently grow, right? I mean, it tends to be more sought to in how RPOs grow. And the third part of the question, Mark, was?\nMark Pompa: Well, I think your question is further out. So 17% of our RPO balance is scheduled to be revenued beyond 12 months.\nAnthony Guzzi: That's pretty consistent.\nMark Pompa: Actually might be on the low side, to be quite honest.\nAnthony Guzzi: Data center work gets done quickly. These big jobs get done in 6 to 9 months sometimes.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. And then there was a comment in the queue about small project quick turn risk, that's the biggest potential headwind, higher interest rates? Are you seeing that yet? I couldn't...\nMark Pompa: I'm sorry, Adam. I think history has shown us that when we're in a rising rate of economy with inflationary pressures, the easiest thing for people to curtail spending is small project work. To date, we haven't seen it clearly in our performance, but it's certainly we're certainly monitoring very closely.\nAnthony Guzzi: Yes. I mean -- and there's a lot of things going on there right now that are different, right? That's where we've seen it in the past. What's different today is energy prices, and the paybacks are quicker. So how that all balances out over time, we'll see.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. Lastly on industrial. Tony, you made a comment, you said something was robust, but the turnarounds were flat in Q4. So I didn't understand that.\nAnthony Guzzi: Yes. So we have good -- I probably didn't say -- I might have said robust around our niche services. We continue to see demand for niche services like heater repair and things like that. We have good demand for our shop services, the best we've had since 2016, '17 in 6 years. So my view is robust, but robust is how I would describe the niche services.\nAdam Thalhimer: Niche services, got it. And then are there any -- for that segment, do you see any new secular drivers? I'm thinking kind of 1, 2, 3 years out.\nAnthony Guzzi: Well, I think one is where we're positioned, right? We're positioned on the Gulf Coast, where the refining capacity has the most advantages.  I think the second secular driver will be when we can get some renewable work back in the business on the electrical side. We've proven we had network really well, electrically. We're not putting panels in that, but we're actually connecting that field to the substation to the grid. So that would be one.  Another one would be upstream. We're positioned well in the Permian and Bakken specifically. And we expect both of them to have more robust opportunities here 1 to 3 years out.  And then there are some interesting opportunities around also how they're helping start to think about methane management for lack of a better word and what we can do to participate in that. And we are doing some things right now to do that as they start to think about how they bring more electrification into the well instead of using diesel generators.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tony Guzzi for any closing remarks.\nAnthony Guzzi: All right. Thank you all very much. I guess we all won't talk together until February. So be well, have a great holiday season, and everybody be safe. And I guess, Happy Halloween, not one of my favorite holidays, but Happy Halloween.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Anthony Guzzi",
            "content": "Thanks, Kevin, and good morning to everybody, and thank you for joining our call. I'm going to start on Pages 4 through 6. In my remarks, I will focus on the third quarter primarily, and Mark will speak in more detail on our quarterly and year-to-date results. At the end of my remarks, I will discuss some of the key drivers of our performance.  Today, we are announcing a series of record quarterly achievements, revenues, gross profit, operating income, operating income margin, diluted EPS and remaining performance obligations or RPOs. Driving this performance is strong end market demand for our services, especially in semiconductors, data centers, manufacturing, health care and retrofit projects. This demand, coupled with excellent execution, has produced outstanding results, not only a quarterly basis but also for year-to-date 2023.  For the third quarter, we earned $3.61 in non-GAAP earnings per diluted share on $3.21 billion in revenues. We grew revenues 13.5% overall with 12.8% organic revenue growth.  We had an adjusted operating margin of 7.4%, which is exceptional by any measure. However, I would like to remind you that margins can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on the mix, execution and timing of projects, most of which worked in our favor this quarter. Our operating cash flow for the third quarter was strong at $261 million, which represents over 100% operating income conversion. On a year-to-date basis, we generated $476 million in operating cash flow, which represents a conversion of 81%.  Our RPOs are an all-time high of $8.6 billion, which represents -- excuse me, represents 4.2% sequential growth from June 30, 2023, and 21.6% growth over the year-ago period. This was exceptional performance by an extraordinary team.  On a segment basis, we had excellent performance in our Electrical and Mechanical Construction and U.S. Building Services segment. The operating results of our Industrial Services segment continue to improve at a modest pace. And despite difficult economic conditions, our U.K. Building Services segment is reporting operating income and operating margin which is greater than a year-ago period.  The continued strength of our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments is evidenced by quarterly revenue growth of 10.1% and 19.9%, respectively. With Mechanical Construction operating margin of 10.4% and Electrical Construction operating margin of 9.1%, the conversion from revenue to operating income by these segments has exceeded our expectation.  We had excellent execution and great project mix. Across the country, we continue to complete some of the most sophisticated projects in markets such as the high-tech manufacturing sector, which includes semiconductors, the EV value chain, biotech, life sciences and pharmaceuticals, the EV value chain and the network and communications sector, which encompasses our data center work; the manufacturing sector, which is driven by reshoring and domestic capacity expansion as well as the healthcare sector. Our industry-leading capabilities in BIM, prefabrication, project planning and labor sourcing and the management of that labor and the training of that labor enable us to perform for our customers while also achieving superior financial returns. Our mechanical product offering is broad across applications such as HVAC, process, piping, plumbing and fire protection and fire life safety. We are operating in the key geographies where such projects are in process, and our fire life safety group has the capability to move across the country.  Our customers look to us to perform complex installations in the markets I just referenced. Our Electrical Construction team has deep expertise in the data center market as well as our Mechanical Construction team, which allows us to serve our customers with the right solution delivered under the most demanding schedules with excellent outcomes for our customers.  As I have mentioned on earlier calls, our segment and subsidiary management teams are leading in an exceptional manner. And they're allocating resources in a thoughtful and pragmatic way while working towards outstanding outcomes for our customers and for you, our shareholders, and that's how they produce these outstanding financial results. Our U.S. Building Services segment continues to perform well and has a strong mix of work across its service lines. The segment's revenues grew 13.7% in the third quarter with an operating margin of 7%.  Demand persists for our mechanical services with excellent execution across retrofit projects, building controls and maintenance and repairs. We are working across a variety of end markets, including traditional and high-tech manufacturing. And our institutional and commercial customers remain focused on energy efficiency and IAQ upgrades. We did experience a strong repair service season because of the heat that blanketed most parts of the country over this past summer. The Mechanical Services business is driving the robust performance of the segment on a quarterly and year-to-date basis, and the overall trends for this business remain positive. The site-based services division continues to deliver entering into multiyear facility maintenance contracts to leverage our self-perform operating model for skilled trades people and operating engineers. As a result, there continues to remain areas of growth in this -- there continue -- remains opportunities for growth for this service line. However, these contracts take some time to ramp up. And scope for these contracts can expand, reduce or return [indiscernible] over time and upon rebid.  Our Industrial Services segment continues to improve at an expected pace. It is important to remember that the third quarter is typically a weak quarter for field services, contributing to the near breakeven operating income reported by this segment this quarter.  We anticipate executing a fall turnaround season that is comparable to the prior year, and demand for our new services is robust. We are experiencing increased levels of capital spending, which then drives demand in our shop services division in the form of greater new build heat exchange orders. We continue to wait for the resumption of demand for utility scale solar projects, which continues to be affected by supply chain issues. And we are well positioned to perform such projects when these issues subside.  Our U.K. business continues to perform in a manner consistent with the available market opportunities. Building on its normal base of facility services contracts, EMCOR U.K. continues to perform various project work for its customers. Much of that work is aimed at helping them develop and implement multiple multiyear energy reduction programs. Although we experienced a reduction in quarterly revenues within this segment, we are executing well as shown by the 8% operating margin during the quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong, supporting both our organic growth and the capital needed to invest in such growth, whether through expanding our prefabrication capabilities or investment in BIM, automation and robotics. We also have the firepower to make bolt-on acquisitions that help us expand our capabilities in support of our customers. Great quarter.  And Mark, I'll let you talk about the rest of it. Thanks, Mark. And I'm going to be on -- thanks, Mark. I'm going to be on Page 12. And look, we put this page in the last time, and we really got a lot of great feedback from our investors. And I like this page because it really talks about what's driving our business from a macro level and a micro level because there's some micro drivers in here.  And these opportunities on this page is really what's driving our organic growth. It's been very strong. I mean, when you think about 12.8% organic growth in the quarter, you say what's driving that? It can't just be business as usual to do that.  So if you go on this page, we're going to go left to right across the top of the box and then start over again on the bottom and go left to right, and we'll draw interconnections where appropriate. Let's talk about electrification in the EV value chain. We, as a management team, have done a lot of work around energy transition and the thought process behind it. I think we -- I know I personally landed on, this is not just an energy transition. It's an energy expansion because if you really want to fund other than the bottom-right box the rest of these things, you need more energy.  And -- but we're going to have to do it not with just traditional sources. We're going to have to do it with traditional sources, renewable sources. There's going to be a lot of investment. There is a lot of investment. On the transition side, some of that investment has been held up by supply chain. That's not going to break easily, right, because things like transformers, inverters. You hear a lot about the panels, but the other ones are just supply chain issues where things have been pushed out 18 to 36 months for some products. But there's a lot of work going on around transition and to be prepared about that transition. Where we're going to play in that is supporting some of that transition. And then also on the electric vehicle and battery plant construction, there's a lot of discussion around this. So at the highest level, this trend right now is probably impacting our current results less than any of the other trends that you see on this page. But it is a trend that will impact our results. We're also going to be a user of some of these transition vehicles, right, whether they be hybrids or whether they be battery powered over time. So we're going to be in the construction, the supply chain of those plants that are going to support the EV plants and then also the battery plant construction. EMCOR has always been very careful of how we service the automotive sector, and we'll continue to be so. Right now, this is an electrical and fire life safety and fire protection opportunity for us, but it will expand beyond that. We do expect there to be more utility grade the way we think about it, massive number of charging stations at one location. We've done some of that and some of the big warehouses that have been built. But we haven't seen that proliferation yet, but we expect to -- for a lot of the last-mile delivery, a lot of these mass charging stations make a lot of sense. They're also supported by government incentive. So you sort of separate the noise of what's going on today, there's going to be a slower pickup. A lot of the things we do along this are for the infrastructure that's going to allow things that happen at a later date. And again, it's the box of all of these that's impacting our current results the least. You go in to say high-tech manufacturing, life sciences, and you got to sort of drag that bottom-middle box up into it because it's also a reshoring, nearshoring issue. We are very active in the semiconductor space, and we're in a lot of the right markets, both mainly mechanically but somewhat electrically in fire protection in the mechanical business as well as just straight mechanical work. And in some cases, we operate on the clean side, the high-purity piping and other places, we're doing both. We're doing the -- we call it the dirty side, but as far from dirty, it's the infrastructure to support that semiconductor plant. We're also doing some of the low-voltage offerings, and we have a pretty robust position in fire life safety and fire protection in those semiconductor plants. And then there's a whole ecosystem around those semiconductor plants that's built to support those semiconductor plants. And in that case, we're doing some of that work, but those are actually more significant maintenance opportunities for us versus semiconductor plants. On the pharma, biotech, life sciences, we are seeing it. We're seeing it in 2 ways. One is the reshoring, and we're seeing it also in the expansion of opportunity, right? These weight loss drugs are causing whole new plants to be built. And that's especially true in some of the hubs where we're most effective, whether that be New Jersey, Research Triangle Park or out into Southern California. And that links to nearshoring, especially for some of the plants that are being built to break the dependence on China and even India for pharmaceutical compounds. Government incentives continue to support that momentum, especially on the semiconductor side, but a lot of that was happening. What the government incentives will do is to elongate that cycle and bring more surety to that demand.  When you get to data centers and connectivity, this is something we're pretty good at, right, both mechanically, electrically and fire protection, life safety. We're good at it. And so the demand drivers are -- they've been ubiquitous, and then AI just adds another boost to it.  So go back to that first box, where we talked about electrification and energy transition. A data center uses a lot of power up to 50 to 100 megawatts. So to put that in perspective, 5,000 homes use less than 200 megawatts, and they use it intermittently. A data center is using 60 to 100 megawatts. So half of what 5,000 homes would do, it has to be continuous. It has to be clean. It has to be pure. And so if you think about that and then you think about where they're being built, we're in really good shape, both mechanically and electrically. I'd say we do data center construction as good as anybody in the country for those specialty trades and we're linked with the right customers.  And there, you're also thinking about how you make them better for the owner, how you get the schedule quicker and how you continue to drive all across the top here, prefabrication, BIM, to allow a solution to be ready to be built. And we're always thinking about the value add we can do with design assist to help them get to the best cost solution for their data center needs.  Great team here. We're active in about 5 or 6 markets. And we continue to look opportunities to support our customers, both from the GC and construction manager side but also the 5 major end owners that use these data centers.  You get to healthcare, this is a market we've seen rebound since COVID. It's always been a good market for us because all the things that make those top boxes complicated, complicated systems, lots of systems coming together is true in a hospital between the med gases, the electrical, the backup generation, the power quality monitoring, the building control systems.  Think about what goes into hospital. And that even goes beyond the hospitals we're trying to make more flexible, but also the outpatient facilities get more sophisticated every day. And it's in those hospitals and outpatient facilities. We also see an aftermarket opportunity that require the kind of services we offer, both with our mechanical services function, our aftermarket fire life safety business and also our site-based services.  To get to reshoring, nearshoring, I'd go from the bottom up, there automation is allowing industries even beyond what we talked about to be reshored. And they have to, right? We used -- we went from a world where multiple suppliers, multiple plants, it's one supplier, multiple plants. So we got into a really bad place in our supply chain, not us EMCOR, right? We buy other people's stuff of one plant supplying, and that might be in China and people aren't comfortable with that. And so COVID brought that to a head. People were thinking about it beforehand. We've been investing in being able to support those customers for 10 years now. So you're seeing a lot of capacity shifting across a range of industries from tire manufacturing to other automotive manufacturing, auto parts manufacturing to textiles even coming back through automation. So a host of industries are returning and they're doing it to do not only -- I would say, it's capacity hardening and expansion. And finally, one of my favorites because I've been around it for 25 years is energy efficiency and sustainability around that energy efficiency. And we are known for what we do in HVAC control system and lighting retrofits. When we bought ECM, they have that capability, too, but they also have water reduction capability. And it's something as simple as how you fix the faucets, how you use smart plumbing facilities -- plumbing fixtures. And that can have a big impact.  It's also helping our customers with their facilities footprint adjustment rationalization. It's making sure that folks can get the right utility rebates. It's adding in not on these massive utility scale solar or utility scale combined heat and power but local decentralized distributed generation.  These are typically things that are 1 megawatt or less that can help shave the load but also provide more energy security and energy reduction when combined together with an HVAC or lighting or control system retrofit. There's government incentives. There are utility incentives. Our folks are expert of that. And we've carved out a niche in that market of not only doing the work directly for the owners, but also supporting just about all the ESCOs as they bring their solutions to life.  And with that, I'm going to turn to Page 13 and sort of tie that into our RPOs on this page. Like we've said, this will show up by segment and market sector. We have great RPOs right now at $8.6 billion, right? That's a big level. It's up $1.5 billion from where we were in the year-ago period. And when they were $7.1 billion, we're pretty happy about that a year ago.  Additionally, the third quarter bookings were strong with RPOs increasing almost $350 million from June, which was 1 -- anyway, you look at that, that's about a 4% sequential increase. Each of our 5 segments saw RPO growth in third quarter from the year-ago period. Domestic construction services RPO, which includes fire protection life safety projects are up over $1.3 billion in line with strong project demand that we've seen all year. Building services, which are anchored by that energy efficiency box and other retrofit box we talked before. So our RPOs increased 16% over last year's third quarter.  RPOs by market sector tied back to the organic growth trends I talked on the previous page. If you zeroing on the actual activity, high-tech manufacturing, which includes those things, semiconductors, pharma, biotech, life sciences, R&D and the electric vehicle value chain, they're up $716 million or 113% from the year-ago period.  Network and communication, which includes our hyperscale data center work and our low voltage work stands at $1.4 billion. That's up 40% from third quarter of last year. We have over $1 billion in healthcare market sector RPOs as the hospital industry and the medical surgical patient industry continues to reshape post-pandemic. And they're also responding to demographic trends. We've discussed nearshoring and nearshoring and manufacturing. You see some of that in that high-tech manufacturing, but just traditional manufacturing, the way we think about it is up 30% year-over-year.  RPOs also grew in the water and wastewater. We've talked about that before in institutional, and that's up 29%. And that's really for us, focused on the water and wastewater side in Florida, where we have great capability in that growing state that struggles to keep up with demand with infrastructure. If you're offsetting this increase, we've had some reduction in commercial, but it's not what you think. It's warehouse projects. We're very active a year ago, especially with our fire protection and life safety but also our electrical. That's down. You'd expect that to be down right now. There's been a lot of build there. The cold storage is still pretty good as well as the transportation market sector that tends to be very episodic for us. And that will come back at some point, but it's not what's driving our results today. We're well positioned in the sectors with strong growth characteristics.  So to get ahead of you and your questions both for later in this call and also when you call us later to reiterate what we said on this call, we like our market mix, our contract mix and our margin mix and our RPOs. Now we've got to go execute. And hopefully, that all stays on track and scope doesn't expand and all that. I mean, all that sort of came together for us this quarter, but we do like our mix and backlog. If you go now, I'm going to be on Pages 14 to 16 to wrap this up. We've had exceptional performance this year. We had last year, too. And we're going to have another meaningful guidance increase. This results from favorable demand in strong end markets, coupled with excellent execution, strong project mix and timing and really a general absence of badness. We are raising our diluted EPS guidance based on our strong third quarter and year-to-date performance from a range of $10.75 to $11.25 to a range of $12.25 to $12.65 on a non-GAAP basis. We will also revise our revenue guidance. Approximately $12.5 billion. Now we had a range from $12 billion to $12.5 billion, we're going to be $12.5 billion now.  As reflected in our RPOs and as discussed previously, we continue to win work in important strategic market sectors. We are executing our work with efficiency, discipline and precision as shown by our record operating margin. We are utilizing technology in BIM, prefabrication. And we're doing a great job managing our labor and managing our supply chain. And we do all this with delivering -- an eye toward delivering great results for our customers first and as a result, we deliver for you, our shareholders.  As I stated earlier, it is important to remember that margins can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on the mix execution and timing of projects. We evaluate our margin performance, our operating margin performance in ranges, and we've talked about that over a period of time. And our performance in the current quarter has yielded margins, operating margins at or above the high end of our historical ranges.  Our team has shown great resilience in dealing with supply chain issues. They're still there. Lead times are terrible. And we continue to develop a strong bench from foreman to project managers to senior leadership. Further, we continue to attract notable talent from skilled labor through senior project and operations management.  However, there are always things you need to consider and be prudent. We do remain concerned with the financial risk to our customers around higher interest rates and macro uncertainties posed by the Ukraine war, the war between Hamas and Israel, turmoil in the oil and gas markets, which will only get worse from those things and the dysfunction occurring in the U.S. government, which may lead to a government shutdown or the inability to fund key pieces of legislation. Additionally, while we do not believe the UAW strike will significantly impact us or our current projects, it may slow the release of future work within the EV value chain. Despite these challenges, we believe that we will be able to navigate them as we have in the past. Our team has always shown great resiliency. However, we do need to remain cognizant of these external factors and the potential impact on our execution and performance. We're going to continue to be balanced capital allocators. There continues to be opportunity within our acquisition pipeline. And with uncertainty in the financial markets, we believe that our strong balance sheet helps us win work on large, sophisticated projects as customers see our financial strength as just another reason to choose EMCOR. As always, I want to thank our entire EMCOR team for their dedication and hard work. We appreciate all you do every day for our customers first at EMCOR. With that, Betsy, I'll take questions. I would agree with you. We haven't seen it in our bidding or our opportunities. I think if you're going to see it anywhere, right, you'll see it in places that have the most far-out opportunity and the most strain on balance sheets. There's probably better people than me to talk about where that will be. But really, I think we see pretty good demand across most of these. And I think that it'll important, Brent, I think part of what you're driving at is what you typically see as some of this work unfolds after the initial activity comes on a site is, in general, projects then get let in smaller amounts, right, because we're there.  And we're working with them to develop the add-on work and the next scope. So I think there's great demand in there yet. I think these are really good drivers, but nothing is literally up and to the right, right? There's always a little jags along the way. We haven't seen that recently, but history would say that, that will, in fact, happen. But the underlying drivers of this over a 5-year period should continue to be pretty strong. Yes. I think it's mix, but also contractual terms. Mark's talked about that, and I've talked about this in the past. The same project could be done, some of them may change their contractual terms because they haven't developed the scope, they think they should. So we'll maybe getting a GMP environment instead of a fixed price environment because that's going to protect us the most or we may get in an environment where the design wasn't frozen. We haven't been able to get design assist. And as a result of that, profitability can be delayed, right, Mark, because we'll -- the way the change orders get booked.  So they can be a little chunky along the way. But clearly, where we do the best is when we know the work, we can do a fixed price contract, and we have more control of the schedule. Yes, and building on that, right? We -- at the profitability levels we're at, we are much more focused on margin dollars right now than we are margin percentages and the growth they're in. And we don't control necessarily how people decide to let contracts and what that contract structure could be. The other thing along that, that I would add is, one of the changes that's happened in the market, and I don't see this changing, Brent. If you go back 10, 12 years on some of these jobs, what people would have tried to do is they would have tried to take these projects and break them up into small pieces as they can, which causes massive coordination issues on the job and that allows more contractors to bid. So there's a couple of things that have happened, right? With the rise of BIM even more ubiquitous and more complicated, coupled with the demand for prefabrication because it's the best way to get labor efficiency and reduce the need for craft labor on a job because they have plenty of work to do anyway, that it's much more difficult to do that. And so you're really looking for sophisticated contractors to be part of the team earlier, and you're working together to develop the best solution for the customer where before that we might have not got involved till 70%, 80%, 90%, a lot of times we're getting involved 40% to 60%, and we're not completing design. What we're doing is completing the design for constructability with design assist. And that makes a big difference about what kind of people we're working with and who they can work with. Yes. I mean we never give 2024 guide. You know that, and you're not asking for that. Actually, you're asking what's the external environment and how that could shape the environment we compete in.  Look, I think energy markets remain really uncertain. And all of the energy -- when I [indiscernible] sort of the wrong word, all the anxiety that we felt at the start of the Ukraine war, if this horrible situation in Israel becomes even more expanded and more difficult through the rest of the Middle East, it's going to have a similar or worse effect than what that Ukraine issue did on energy markets.  And so that could be a real issue, right, not only for us, right, as it's consumer of energy, we buy a lot of gasoline and diesel, but in the place that could happen therein, but also sort of what it does to global supply chains and the uncertainty around shipping. I mean, all of the things that come with that, right?  I also think that the other thing that could sort of dampen -- again, I don't think it dampens, right? We're sitting here with $8.6 billion of RPOs off of a $7.1 billion a year ago print, which I think even then was up 30% from the previous year. So we have good momentum in RPOs.  So it is what people's conviction going to be around sort of capital investment if inflation its ugly head because of labor costs and other people have or other things. So there's some macro indicators out there.  Interest rates, in my mind, aren't going down. I think that's what our team believes here. We're going to run our balance sheet very prudent. But for those that are more extended, right, there's a lot of people with a lot of debt out there. And as those debts come to maturity, that could have an impact.  But again, go back to our boxes and you think of our customers that are driving this right now. Data center customers, whether they be in build for use, which is one part of the market or those big customers are doing it themselves, they have cash, and they continue to generate cash.  They're not dependent on financing. Semiconductors because of who they are and who they're funded by even without our government funding are fairly good with cash. There, it's going to be a matter of as they commission the first fabs on these sites, what have they learned as they go to the second one, there could be delays. There always is. That could be an issue, right? So those customers are more cash rich. The pharma company is the same. Healthcare looks pretty healthy right now. They have a need to be able to put hospitals in the market, right? They just don't build a hospital. Someone has to tell them there's a certificate of need for you to build that hospital in this market and especially in markets where the demographics are shifting to, we continue to see that.  And then there's old hospitals, right? We're doing work at Mass General right now, great hospital but outdated facilities that they're rebuilding, and we're thrilled to be part of that. And so I feel good about it. If you're going to see it anywhere, you might start to see it in some of the energy efficiency work we do for our commercial customers. But they're going to be caught between things, right? Because if they don't make their buildings more energy efficient, they become harder to lease.  So there's a lot going on there. I feel pretty good about where we're at. But I think, in general, there could be some -- you see it in the warehousing, you'll probably see in retail something we don't serve very much is where you'll really see it, and then you'll get it with people with strained balance sheet, some of these private equity-owned assets that have a lot of debt on them. No, not with the kind of deals we do. I think they look at the size we like to do $50 million to $200 million, I think they say, hey, there's a place we can put all equity. And the earth and heavens will come together, and we'll be able to finance this at a lower rate in the next 18 months. So we don't believe that. That's clearly what they believe.  So no, the answer is no. We really don't compete against them a lot. I mean, if someone really wants to go to PE, we're probably out in the first round anyway, we -- to get the great cultural fit and really understand the management team and it is a management team that's going to be there for the long term, sometimes that's not a great fit. Yes. So I'll take the third one. I don't even think about market share, never have. Such a big market that 19 years, more 30 years, got 30 years, you guys ever look at market share? So you can take that one away. We don't think about it. We wouldn't know how to answer that question. Massive market, we're a small part of it.  Second one, are we too full? That becomes a question of what's the project, what's the size of the project, what's the timing of that project. So here's how I think about that.  Our governor has less to do with how we'll be able to fill skilled craft and technical labor. We'll find that. We've always found -- and we're a really great place to work. We've done a really good job staying ahead of the development of foreman and project managers. And then where we don't have them developed, being able to hire really good people from the outside. So if there's a slowdown in RPO, it's not because we don't think we can develop them. It's just the mix [indiscernible] right, these things come episodically. Rarely do you see a run like we've had over the last 2.5 years where RPOs just consistently grow, right? I mean, it tends to be more sought to in how RPOs grow. And the third part of the question, Mark, was? That's pretty consistent. Data center work gets done quickly. These big jobs get done in 6 to 9 months sometimes. Yes. I mean -- and there's a lot of things going on there right now that are different, right? That's where we've seen it in the past. What's different today is energy prices, and the paybacks are quicker. So how that all balances out over time, we'll see. Yes. So we have good -- I probably didn't say -- I might have said robust around our niche services. We continue to see demand for niche services like heater repair and things like that. We have good demand for our shop services, the best we've had since 2016, '17 in 6 years. So my view is robust, but robust is how I would describe the niche services. Well, I think one is where we're positioned, right? We're positioned on the Gulf Coast, where the refining capacity has the most advantages.  I think the second secular driver will be when we can get some renewable work back in the business on the electrical side. We've proven we had network really well, electrically. We're not putting panels in that, but we're actually connecting that field to the substation to the grid. So that would be one.  Another one would be upstream. We're positioned well in the Permian and Bakken specifically. And we expect both of them to have more robust opportunities here 1 to 3 years out.  And then there are some interesting opportunities around also how they're helping start to think about methane management for lack of a better word and what we can do to participate in that. And we are doing some things right now to do that as they start to think about how they bring more electrification into the well instead of using diesel generators. All right. Thank you all very much. I guess we all won't talk together until February. So be well, have a great holiday season, and everybody be safe. And I guess, Happy Halloween, not one of my favorite holidays, but Happy Halloween."

            "name": "Mark Pompa",
            "content": "Great. Thank you, Tony, and good morning to everyone participating on the call today. We are now on Slide 7 for those of you who are accessing this presentation via the webcast. Over the next several slides, I will augment Tony's opening commentary on EMCOR's third quarter performance as well as provide a brief update on our year-to-date results through September 30. All financial information referenced this morning is derived from our consolidated financial statements included in both our earnings release announcement and Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier today. So let's revisit and expand our review of EMCOR's third quarter performance.  Consolidated revenues of $3.21 billion are up $381.2 million or 13.5% over quarter 3 2022. Each of our domestic reportable segments experienced revenue growth during the third quarter. Excluding $20.4 million of revenues attributable to businesses acquired pertaining to the time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in last year's quarter, revenues for the third quarter of 2023 increased 12.8% when compared to the third quarter of 2022.  Before reviewing the operating results of our individual reporting segments, I would like to reiterate what Tony highlighted earlier that our $3.21 billion of quarterly revenues represents a new all-time quarterly revenue record for the company and eclipses the previous record set during the second quarter. The specific to each of our reportable segment's third quarter revenue performance is as follows. United States Electrical Construction segment revenues of $697.4 million increased $64 million or 10.1% from quarter 3 2022. Excluding incremental acquisition revenues, this segment's revenues grew 8.1% organically quarter-over-quarter. Consistent with its second quarter performance, the segment continues to experience revenue growth across most of the market sectors that they serve. Such quarterly revenue growth was most prevalent within the network and communications, healthcare, manufacturing and industrial and hospitality and entertainment market sectors.  Revenues of our United States Mechanical Construction segment of $1.33 billion increased $221 million or a strong 19.9% from the year-ago period. This revenue growth continues to be driven by increased activity within the high-tech manufacturing, traditional manufacturing, network and communications and commercial market sectors. Consistent with its performance during the first 6 months of the year, this segment is experiencing growth in both fire and life safety as well as traditional mechanical services. Increased demand is stemming from customer projects supporting the design and manufacturing of semiconductors as well as the production and development of electric vehicles and/or related battery technologies. This, in conjunction with further data center development opportunities as well as the domestic reshoring of critical supply chain by certain of our customers are all contributing factors to the Mechanical Construction segment, establishing a new all-time quarterly record of revenue during the third quarter. Our combined United States construction revenues of $2.03 billion increased $285 million or 16.4%, crossing the $2 billion quarterly revenue threshold for the first time and establishing a combined all-time quarterly revenue record for construction services. United States Building Services revenues of $817.7 million increased $98.3 million or 13.7%, representing a new all-time quarterly revenue record for this segment. Excluding incremental acquisition revenues, the segment's revenues grew 12.6% organically. Revenue growth was experienced across each of the 3 divisions with the largest contribution coming from mechanical services. Specifically, we benefited from an increase in HVAC project and retrofit revenues due to increased availability of equipment and materials when compared to 2022, which faced greater supply chain delays. There also continues to be strong demand for certain of the segment's service offerings as our customers seek ways to improve the energy efficiency and/or indoor air quality of their facilities. Lastly, both the segment's commercial and government site-based services divisions experienced incremental project revenues in the third quarter of the current year as a result of new customer additions or scope and site expansion with existing customers. EMCOR's Industrial Services segment revenues of $252.2 million increased $4.9 million or 2% quarter-over-quarter. Although not as substantial as the revenue growth of our other domestic reporting segments, we are pleased by the trend of period-over-period growth that this segment has achieved the last few years despite the sustained headwinds within the oil and gas industry. Contributing to the growth in the current quarter was a resumption of capital spending by several of our customers in the form of increased new build heat exchanger orders as well as certain renewable fuel projects. United Kingdom Building Services segment revenues of $110.7 million represents a reduction of $7 million or 5.9% from last year's third quarter. The period-over-period revenue decline is a result of the nonrenewal of certain facilities maintenance contracts, which were still active in 2022 as well as the reduction in project activity as certain of this segment's customers have slowed their capital spending programs in light of the macroeconomic headwinds within the United Kingdom. Please turn to Slide 8. Reported operating income for the quarter was $235 million or 7.3% of revenues and favorably compares to $150.1 million of operating income or 5.3% of revenues a year ago. Consistent with my revenue commentary and Tony's opening remarks, the current quarter's consolidated operating income and operating margin each represent new all-time quarterly records for EMCOR.  Included within our reported operating income is a small impairment charge of $2.4 million related to certain long-lived assets within our United States Mechanical Construction segment. On an adjusted basis, if such impairment charge was excluded, third quarter 2023 non-GAAP operating income would be $237.3 million or 7.4% of revenues. Specific operating performance by segment is as follows. Our U.S. Electrical Construction segment earned operating income of $63.1 million, an increase of $27.6 million from the comparable 2022 period. The reported operating margin of 9.1% represents a significant increase from the 5.6% reported in last year's third quarter. Exceptional project execution, which Tony previously commented from each of our operating companies, coupled with a favorable revenue mix when compared to the 2022 period were the primary drivers of this performance. Such improved execution is demonstrated by a reduction of project write-downs as compared to last year's third quarter where certain discrete write-downs totaled $10.5 million and negatively impacted this segment's 2022 operating margin by 170 basis points.  Besides a reduction in write-downs, this segment's operating income and operating margin for the third quarter of 2023 benefited from the successful closeout of certain projects, which positively impacted its operating margin in the quarter by 60 basis points. Third quarter operating income of our U.S. Mechanical Construction segment of $138.5 million represents a $48 million increase from last year's quarter and operating margin of 10.4% represents 220 basis points of improvement from 2022's third quarter. Growth in both gross profit and gross profit margin due to a more favorable revenue mix, including a higher percentage of self-performed projects, were the most significant contributors to this overall improved performance. Additionally, in the Mechanical segment's operating income and operating margin for the quarter benefited from the successful closeout of certain projects, which resulted in 40 basis points of incremental operating margin. Operating income for U.S. Building Services is $57.2 million or 7% of revenues and compares to $46 million or 6.4% of revenues in 2022's third quarter. Similar to the growth in the segment's revenues, the increases in operating income and operating margin were driven by the segment's Mechanical Services division. Notably, we experienced favorable project execution of HVAC projects and retrofits as well as incremental building automation and controls activity. Our U.S. Industrial Services segment incurred an operating loss of approximately $200,000, which compares favorably to an operating loss of $1.4 million in last year's third quarter. As I have referenced in prior years and consistent with Tony's comment, quarter 3 is historically our Industrial segment's weakest quarter. However, we are encouraged by the trend of quarterly improvement within this segment, and we remain ready to assist our customers as they execute their maintenance and capital spending programs. U.K. Building Services operating income of $8.9 million or 8% of revenues represents an increase of $500,000 and a 90 basis point improvement in operating margin. The performance of this segment is impressive considering the reduction in quarterly revenues previously discussed and demonstrates the strength of its portfolio of facilities maintenance contracts.  We are now on Slide 9. Additional financial items of significance for the quarter not addressed on the previous slides are as follows. Quarter 3 gross profit of $545.5 million represents an all-time quarterly gross profit record for the company and is higher than the comparable 2022 quarter by $132.2 million or 32%. And gross margin of 17% has improved 240 basis points. Selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately $308.1 million represent 9.6% of revenues and reflect an increase of $45 million from quarter 3 2022. SG&A for the current year's quarter includes approximately $4.2 million of incremental expenses from businesses acquired inclusive of intangible asset amortization, resulting in an organic SG&A increase of $40.8 million. This quarter's organic growth in SG&A was due to incremental expense pertaining to incentive compensation programs across the majority of our reportable segments. This is due to higher operating results to date when compared to the prior year as well as our revised profitability projections for full year 2023, which have necessitated our third upward revision in our annual earnings guidance. Tony will speak to our revised guidance range in detail following the conclusion of my commentary. Besides incentive compensation, we have experienced quarter-over-quarter growth in our personnel costs due to our continued double-digit organic revenue growth, which has necessitated increased headcount to support our back office and contract administration functions coupled with annual cost of living increases for our existing workforce. We have also experienced an escalation in occupancy costs due to inflationary pressures in the real estate market. Diluted earnings per common share in the third quarter of 2023 is $3.57 as compared to $2.16 per diluted share for the prior year period. On an adjusted basis, excluding the impact of the previously mentioned long-lived asset impairment charge, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $3.61, which represents a $1.45 or 67.1% increase when compared to the $2.16 reported in last year's quarter. As Tony mentioned in his introductory remarks, our third quarter diluted EPS performance on either a GAAP or non-GAAP basis represents a new all-time record for EMCOR by a large margin.  Please turn to Slide 10. With the quarter commentary complete, I will touch on some highlights with respect to our results for the first 9 months of 2023. Revenues of $9.14 billion represent an increase of $1.02 billion or 12.5%, of which 11.3% was generated from organic activities.  Operating income of $586.6 million or 6.4% of revenues represents a 51.3% increase from the results for the first 9 months of 2022. We have experienced improved operating income and operating margin in each of our domestic reporting segments.  Our year-to-date diluted earnings per share was $8.85, which compares to $5.50 in the corresponding 2022 period. Adjusting the current year to include the previously referenced impairment loss results in a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $8.88. Comparing this adjusted number to last year's reported EPS represents an improvement of 61.5% year-over-year. With substantial growth in our year-to-date net income plus the reduction in weighted average shares outstanding due to our share repurchases, EMCOR has been able to generate significant EPS growth. We are now on Slide 11. EMCOR's balance sheet maintains its strength and liquidity. And we continue to be well positioned to fund organic growth, return capital to shareholders and pursue strategic M&A opportunities. Fluctuations of note when compared to December of 2022 are as follows. Cash on hand increased by just over $67 million. Our exceptional operating cash flow was partially offset by cash used for financing activities of $276.2 million, given a repayment of $142.8 million on our term loan and just over $105 million for the repurchase of our common stock as well as cash used for investing activities of $134 million as a result of capital expenditures and acquisitions to date. Resulting primarily from our organic growth during the period, our working capital balance has increased by nearly $128 million. The $34.2 million increase in goodwill is entirely a result of the 7 acquisitions completed by us thus far in 2023 while net identifiable intangible assets have increased by $6.8 million as the additional intangible assets recognized in connection with such acquisitions were partially offset by $49 million of amortization expense in the first 9 months of the year. Total debt, exclusive of operating lease liabilities, has decreased by $143.2 million, almost entirely as a result of the previously mentioned $142.8 million voluntary principal payment made on our term loan. Our stockholders' equity balance has increased by $305.7 million as our net income for the 9-month period exceeded our share repurchases and dividend payments to date in 2023. EMCOR's debt to capitalization ratio has reduced to 4.4% from 11.1% at year-end 2022, given the reduction in borrowings under our credit agreement as well as the increase in stockholders' equity just referenced. With my prepared commentary for the third quarter now completed, I would now like to return the call back to Tony. Tony? Yes. And Brent, the only thing I would add to Tony's comment with regards to mix is clearly scope of services. Tony has commented in past calls that the last couple of years, we've seen fairly sizable growth in our fire protection and life safety services. That work tends to have a better profitability profile than traditional mechanical services. Additionally, a lot of the work we're performing now, a lot of the equipment that we're installing is being procured by our customers. If more of the equipment scope comes back into our future work, the mark-up we get on equipment is certainly less than we get on our labor.  So that ultimately can impact margins when you're looking at them on a comparative period. It's still very good work. Certainly welcome the opportunity to perform all scope for our customers. But certainly, it changes the project profitability characteristics from a margin perspective. Well, I think your question is further out. So 17% of our RPO balance is scheduled to be revenued beyond 12 months. Actually might be on the low side, to be quite honest. I'm sorry, Adam. I think history has shown us that when we're in a rising rate of economy with inflationary pressures, the easiest thing for people to curtail spending is small project work. To date, we haven't seen it clearly in our performance, but it's certainly we're certainly monitoring very closely."

I will be speaking to the second quarter results in my opening commentary. Mark is going to cover both the second quarter and year-to-date results. I will be speaking to pages four through six in my opening comments. We had an extraordinarily strong second quarter, by any measure, at EMCOR. We had revenues of $3.05 billion, which represents 12.5% revenue growth and 11% organic revenue growth. We earned $196.7 million in operating income, and our operating income margin was a strong 6.5%. Diluted earnings per share totaled $2.95. This performance represents an all-time quarterly record for revenues, operating income, operating income margin and diluted earnings per share. We generated strong operating cash flow of $300 million in the quarter and grew our remaining performance obligations or RPO sequentially from Q1 by $413 million or 5.2%, and from the year ago period by $1.8 billion or just over 28%. Our business is performing well across nearly all segments and end markets. Our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments continue to perform well as evidenced by the strong revenue growth of 20.2% and 12.9%, respectively. With Mechanical Construction operating income margin of 10% and Electrical Construction operating income margin of 7.5%, the conversion to operating income by these segments, especially Mechanical, are towards the high end of our expectations. Across the country, we are executing well on some of the most sophisticated projects and markets, such as high-tech manufacturing, which includes semiconductors, the electric vehicle, or EV value chain, biotech, life sciences and pharmaceuticals. The network and communications sector, which encompasses our data center work and the health care sector, are also performing well. We have industry-leading capabilities in BIM or Building Information Modeling, prefabrication, project planning, labor sourcing, management and training. We offer a breadth of mechanical capabilities from HVAC, process piping, plumbing, and we're also a fire -- leading fire protection and life safety contractor, and our customers look to us to perform complex installation in the markets I just referenced. Our segment and subsidiary management teams are leading in an exceptional manner and allocating resources in a thoughtful and pragmatic way, while working towards outstanding outcomes for our customers. We continue to strive to optimize our project mix to produce great financial results. Our US Building Services segment continues to perform well, and it has a strong mix of work across its service lines. Revenue of this segment grew 12.9% in the quarter, with an operating income margin of 6%. Demand continues to be strong and persists for our mechanical services, with excellent execution across retrofit projects, building controls and maintenance and repairs. We are working across a variety of end markets, including traditional commercial markets, but also high-tech manufacturing, institutional and health care customers who remain focused on energy efficiency in indoor air quality, or IAQ upgrades. We expect to have a strong repair service season because of the heat that has blanket most parts of the country as well as extended lead times for applied equipment. This segment continues to enter into facility maintenance contracts, and there are strong demand for our site-based and rob technician services. We're also excited about our pending acquisition of ECM. ECM is a bolt-on acquisition that adds capability. ECM will enhance our energy efficiency service offerings and will allow us to offer such services in a more programmatic way to owners looking for multisite and multiyear programs. Welcome to EMCOR, the ECM folks soon. Our Industrial Services segment continues to improve at a modest pace. We executed a more normal spring turnaround season, and demand for our niche services is robust. Within our shop services, we are beginning to see increased levels of capital spending in the form of greater new build heat exchanger orders. We continue to wait for the resumption of demand for utility scale solar and are well positioned when the supply chain issues subside. Our UK business performed in a manner consistent with the available market opportunities. While we saw a reduction in quarterly revenues, the team remains focused on profitability, as evidenced by the consistent year-over-year second quarter operating income margin. Building on its normal base of facility services contract, EMCOR UK. continues to perform various project work for its customers, much of which is aimed at helping develop and implement multiyear energy reduction programs. Overall, EMCOR continues to have a strong balance sheet that supports our organic growth and the capital investment needed for that growth. We also have the firepower to add bolt-on acquisitions, like ECM, we hope to close soon, that help us expand our capabilities in support of our customers. With that, Mark, I'm going to turn it over to you.\nMark Pompa: Thank you, Tony, and good morning to everyone participating on the call today. For those accessing this presentation via the webcast, we are now on slide seee. Over the next several slides, I will supplement Tony's opening commentary on EMCOR's second quarter performance as well as provide a brief snapshot of our year-to-date results through June 30. All financial information referenced this morning is derived from our consolidated financial statements, included in both our earnings release announcement and Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this morning. So let's revisit and expand our review of EMCOR's second quarter performance. Consolidated revenues of $3.05 billion are up $338.2 million, or 12.5%, over quarter tw2022. Our second quarter results include $40.6 million of revenues attributable to businesses acquired, pertaining to the time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in last year's second quarter. Acquisition revenues positively impacted our United States Electrical Construction segment within the quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, second quarter consolidated revenues increased approximately $297.6 million or 11% quarter-over-quarter. Before reviewing the operating results of our individual reporting segments, I would like to reiterate what Tony highlighted earlier, that our $3.05 billion of quarterly revenues represents a new all-time quarterly revenue record for the company. The specifics to each of our reportable segment's second quarter revenue performance is as follows. United States Electrical Construction segment revenues of $678.2 million increased $114 million or 20.2% from 2022's comparable quarter. Excluding incremental acquisition revenues, the segment's revenues grew a strong 13% organically period-over-period. Increased project activity within the majority of the market sectors served by this segment led to the quarterly revenue improvement. Such growth was most prevalent within the network and communications, manufacturing and industrial, health care and hospitality market sectors. Revenue of this segment were also positively impacted by slightly improved supply chain environment with regards to equipment procurement. Revenues of our United States Mechanical Construction segment of $1.19 billion increased $136.5 billion or 12.9% from the year ago period. Revenue growth during the quarter was largely driven from increased activity within the high-tech manufacturing, network and communications and commercial market sectors. Consistent with this segment's first quarter performance, we are experiencing growth in both fire protection as well as traditional mechanical construction services. This increased demand is stemming from customer projects supporting the design and manufacturer of semiconductors as well as electric vehicles and/or related battery technologies. There additionally continues to be greater demand from our data center customers. With these results, both our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments established new second quarter revenue records. Additionally, our combined U.S. construction revenues as well as that of our U.S. Mechanical Construction segment surpassed the previous all-time quarterly revenue records. United States Building Services segment revenues of $775 million increased $88.5 million or 12.9%, representing an all-time quarterly record for this segment. Revenue growth was experienced across each of the divisions, with the majority being generated from mechanical services. Contributing to this performance was increased HVAC project and retrofit revenues due to slightly improved equipment availability that facilitated greater project execution when compared to 2022. In addition, as commented during prior quarters, this segment continues to experience strong demand for certain of its service offerings as our customers seek ways to improve the energy efficiency and/or indoor air quality of their facilities. EMCOR's Industrial Services segment revenues of $292.3 million increased $7.7 million or 2.7% as we continue to experience a resumption in demand for our field services and are starting to see increased levels of capital spending within this segment's shop services. United Kingdom Building Services segment revenues of $106 million represents a reduction of $8.5 million or 7.4% from last year's second quarter. In addition to a minor degradation in the exchange rate between the British pound and the United States dollar, the period-over-period revenue decline as a result of the loss of certain facilities maintenance contracts due to nonrenewal. Further contributing to this decrease in revenues is a reduction in project activity, as certain of the segment's customers are re-evaluating their capital spending programs in light of the macroeconomic headwinds within the UK. Please turn to slide eight. Reported operating income for the quarter was $196.7 million or 6.5% of revenues and favorably compares to $137.6 million of operating income, or 5.1% of revenues a year ago. Consistent with my revenue commentary and Tony's opening remarks, the current quarter's consolidated operating income and operating margin each represent new all-time quarterly records for EMCORE. Specific operating performance by segment is as follows: our US. Electrical Construction segment earned operating income of $50.7 million, an increase of $15.6 million from the comparable 2022 period. Reported operating margin of 7.5% represents an improvement from the 6.2%. And last year's second quarter, consistent with the segment's first quarter performance, we experienced better project execution as well as a more favorable revenue mix year-over-year. Such execution, coupled with a steady improvement within the supply chain and our ability to adapt to the current operating environment, resulted in a reduced level of discrete project write-downs quarter-over-quarter. Second quarter operating income of our US Mechanical Construction segment of $119.8 million represents a $43.2 million increase from last year's quarter and operating margin of 10% represents a substantial improvement from an already strong 7.2% in the second quarter of 2022. Growth in both gross profit and gross profit margin, due to a more favorable revenue mix, including a higher percentage of self-perform projects, were the most significant contributors to this improved operating performance. In addition, the segment benefited from a lack of significant project write-downs when compared to last year, as well as the favorable closeout of several projects during the current year quarter. Operating income for US Building Services was $46.1 million or 6% of revenues and compares to $38.5 million or 5.6% of revenues in 2022 second quarter. Improved operating performance within the segment's Mechanical Services division, as a result of both favorable project execution as well as the impact of contract price adjustments in response to inflation, were the primary drivers of the period-over-period increases. Our US Industrial Services segment's operating income was $7.9 million, or 2.7% of revenues, represents a slight increase in terms of both dollars and margin from the comparable prior year period. We are seeing incremental demand across the segment's scope of services, which has led to a better mix of revenues and resulted in higher gross profit and gross profit margin. Resulting from the reduction in revenues previously referenced, UK Building Services operating income of $5.9 million represents a modest decrease from Q2 of 2022. However, operating margin of 5.6% remains consistent with that of the prior year, reflecting greater gross profit contribution from this segment's current portfolio of work. We are now on slide 9. Additional financial items of significance for the quarter not addressed in the previous slides are as follows. Quarter two gross profit of $490.1 million is higher than the comparable 2022 quarter by $107.1 million or 28%, and gross margin of 16.1% has improved 200 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately $293.4 million represent 9.6% of revenues and reflect an increase of $48 million from quarter two 2022 SG&A for the current year's quarter includes approximately $5.1 million of incremental expenses from businesses acquired, inclusive of intangible asset amortization, resulting in an organic SG&A increase of $42.9 million. EMCORE's continued double-digit revenue growth has necessitated investments in human capital in the form of additional personnel and training to support our back-office and contract administration functions. This, coupled with annual cost of living increases for our existing workforce, has resulted in a quarter-over-quarter increase in salaries and benefits. Also impacting our second quarter overhead was incremental expense pertaining to incentive compensation programs across the majority of our reportable segments. This is due to our higher operating results to date as well as our revised profitability projections for full year 2023, which have necessitated our second upward revision in our annual earnings guidance. Tony will speak to our guidance range in detail later in this morning's presentation. Diluted earnings per common share was $2.95 as compared to $1.99 in the year ago quarter. Our second quarter performance establishes a new quarterly earnings per share record due to the combination of our strong net income our share repurchase activity, which has reduced our actual and weighted average shares outstanding. Please turn to slide 10. With the quarter commentary complete, I will touch on some highlights with respect to EMCOR's results for the first six months of 2023. Revenues of $5.94 billion represent an increase of $636.1 million or 12%, of which 10.6% was generated organically. Operating income of $351.6 million or 5.9% of revenues represents a 48% increase from the results of the first six months of 2022, as we have experienced improved operating income and operating margin in each of our domestic reporting segments. Our year-to-date diluted earnings per share was $5.28, which represents an approximate 57% increase over the $3.36 reported in 2022 as corresponding x-month period. With substantial growth in our net income, coupled with an almost 8% reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding due to our share repurchases throughout 2022 and 2023, we have been able to drive significant EPS growth on a year-to-date basis. My last comment on our results for the first half of 2023, and Tony commented specifically on the quarter, is that our operating cash flow of $214.9 million on a year-to-date basis represents a significant improvement over the cash used in operations of $18.9 million in 2022 six-month period. Despite our significant organic revenue growth and the resulting demands on working capital investment, our subsidiary management teams have done an excellent job of generating cash flow conversion, something we have been doing consistently over a long period of time. We are now on slide 11. EMCOR's balance sheet remains strong and liquid, and we continue to be in a position to invest in our business, return capital to shareholders and pursue strategic M&A investments. Fluctuations when compared to December of 2022 are as follows: Cash on hand was just over $503 million, which represents an increase of $46.6 million. Our exceptional operating cash flow was partially offset by cash used for financing activities of $126.4 million, inclusive of just over $105 million for the repurchase of our common stock. In addition, we've utilized $48.4 million for investing activities in the form of capital expenditures and acquisitions. Resulting primarily from our organic growth during the period, our working capital balance has increased by nearly $152 million. The $8.3 million increase in goodwill is entirely a result of the five acquisitions completed by us thus far in 2023, while net identified intangible assets have decreased by $19.5 million as the additional intangible assets recognized in connection with such acquisitions were more than offset by $32 million of amortization expense in the first half of the year. Total debt has remained substantially consistent our stockholders' equity balance has increased by $143.8 million as our net income for the period exceeded our share repurchases and dividend payments. As a result of our consistent debt balance, coupled with the increase in stockholders' equity, EMCOR's debt to capitalization ratio has reduced to 10.4% from 11.1% at year-end 2022. EMCOR was anticipating a strong 2023 after a record 2022, and our performance to date as well as revised expectations for full year 2023 are validating such expectations. With my portion of this morning's slide presentation complete, I will now return the call back to Tony.\nAnthony Guzzi: Thanks, Mark, and I'm going to be on page 12. And what I wanted to do before we jump into the remaining performance obligation's absolute levels, is I wanted to take a step back and talk about what's been driving our exceptional organic growth and our RPO growth over the last two years, and what's been driving profitable organic growth for us. And if you look at this page, I want to take a step back also and say, if you look at these trends we're talking about on Page 12, they're front and center in the news every day. They're not only front and center from customers making investments, they're also the focus of government policy, in some cases, to strengthen those sectors for the long term. Secondarily, each one of these sectors require highly skilled labor, very skilled supervision, project managers and engineers that are really at the top of the industry. And the government incentives, where they're aiding in certain cases, want that kind of workforce on those jobs because it's more productive, it's safer and it's trained. And again, going back to the great supervision point. So let's talk about each of these in turn, and there's a little bit connectivity between a couple of them, and I'll talk about that. The first one is electrification and the EV, or electric vehicle value chain. In a lot of ways, that's a whole new industry, right, that's being built in plants, suppliers -- second- and third-tier suppliers, and we're certainly seeing that work in battery plants, which is the raw material. And we're certainly seeing that work really burgeoning across the country, especially in the mid-central part of the country in Midwest and also the Southeast and a little bit in the Southwest. We are participating on a lot of these efforts, and there's more to come. And I will say that the pace and timing of actual delivery has been a little slower, but we continue to see the work and book the work, and we're very bullish on the sector. And it's across all of our trades. It's electrical work, mechanical work and fire life safety. And this is an area where our fire life safety products are in great demand because we can provide a comprehensive solution of not only the wet side, the sprinkler, but also the fire alarm to give these folks that are starting these facilities the assurance that we can deliver these complex systems. We're also participating in EV charging stations, but we're doing it at scale. So what we're doing is we're bringing in lots of megawatts to supply an EV charging station for a fleet or also our big centralized hub. We will -- I'm sure, across EMCOR, we're participating in the local installations, but we're not really participating in any significant way in national rollouts of individual passenger car rollouts. Again, we will do some of that work, but the stuff that we like to do is megawatt-driven, high-scale charging stations. We also believe the electrification also leads to an energy transition. But I think, at EMCOR, we believe more and more every day, it's an energy expansion. So think about all of the things on this page, they all require a lot of energy. And it's going to be a mix of all kinds of energy and all kind of solutions to make that energy cleaner. And this part of the trends that are driving our growth in RPOs, I think we're in the first couple of innings of. And I think the government incentives that have been put out through the various acts and you've heard us talk about those, will allow that momentum to continue. It wasn't the advent of what was happening, but it certainly will provide bolstering to those trends continuing. The next part is actually work that we're actively involved in today. And we see that -- and we're still on the front end as these new sites get built out. Let me give you an example, semiconductor manufacturing. What you read in the paper, a lot of the semiconductor build was happening or planned and it's going to be bolstered by the CHIPS Act. We're participating in a number of ways. We're participating mechanically, and we participate in some markets on the high-purity piping and others. We do quote in a form -- semi, the dirty side, which is far from dirty, but it's more of the HVAC and process cooling. We do both. And it depends on the capability of our subsidiary in that market and what the best mix of work that we can bring to bear in that market. We're participating electrically, especially on the low-voltage communication side, and we're participating with fire life safety across multiple plants across the country. When you go to the pharma biotech life sciences R&D, let me take the first two, pharma and biotech. That's actually coupled with what I'm going to talk about later on reshoring nearshoring. So we're seeing reshoring of the pharma industry to bring resilience to the supply chain, but we're also seeing as new drugs get built, like Ozempic, right, where people need to build capacity to build it up. And it's in areas where we are well positioned to do the work, and it's across all of our trades, but especially mechanically in fire life safety. The pharma area of RTP, Research Triangle Park, big pharma area, Southern New Jersey, Northeastern Pennsylvania, Indiana and Southern California are all big pharma areas. And it's areas where we'll have done the work over time. We have the trust of the customers, and we're well positioned to deliver that work for the long term. As you go to the life sciences R&D, that's much more expansive. R&D facilities are happening in commercial conversions. They're happening in just about every major medical center that we work in, and they're happening also as part of more incubator startup-type companies, where we're helping build out the facilities, and in life sciences is the same thing there. Again, go to the semiconductor part, we believe that the CHIPS Act will continue to cement those sites as long-term build, and it's a national security issue. So we think that has long-term build. And when you understand the semiconductor market, once you're on a site and if you're doing good work, you get add-on work on that site to build the next fab, expand the fab, do the process cooling work. The next one, if you go to the right -- upper right, is data centers and connectivity. Through various calls, a lot of questions have been asked, do we see the data center build slowing down? We said no. And we said, WELL, maybe that's because we're a late cycle.\" The reality is you got to figure the big data center owners and -- especially the -- both the REITs and the five big ones to build it. They understood that they were going to need more capacity. And so they secured the land, the facilities and it kept building because of really, what's driving it now is not only the increased need for storage and more cloud computing, which companies like EMCOR, or big companies like us are doing more every day, but also AI. AI is accelerating more build-out and it's more robust build up. So when we started building data centers 20 years ago, we thought a 5- to 10-megawatt data center was a big data center, which, by the way, 10, 15 megawatts is what a big assembly plant actually uses in the automotive, maybe 20. So think about what you see there. Now -- then we move to 40, then we moved to 50 to 75. The data centers, hyperscale that we're building now are somewhere between 75 and 125 megawatts of power. Put into perspective, right, you need 5,000 -- you need 1,500 acres and 600,000 panels to generate 200 megawatts. That gives you an idea where you need an LM 8,000 from GE. You need half of the production of one of those gas turbines to support one data center. So just think of the scale of these data centers, and go back to the first block of why we think it's more of an energy expansion and also an energy transition at the same time. And that is a long-term trend. We're also going back and remodeling and adding more power to data centers that we built a mere 5 to 7 years ago, and that has just started. So we see a strong data center market. We're contractors, so 2 to 3 years is an outlook for us. But we see a strong data center market for the foreseeable future. Going to the bottom left in health care, we've always been bullish on health care. A health care system is as complex as any of the three things above, right, a major hospital. Every system comes to bear in an operating room, a patient room, an ICU bed, or a very sophisticated outpatient clinic. And what the pandemic taught people, we, certainly, participate in helping people make their hospitals more flexible is that's got to be permanent. And so you're seeing more robust patient power build than we've seen in 5, 8 years. And it's also coupled with more sophisticated outpatient facilities. We really didn't participate previously a lot in outpatient facilities, but with the sophistication level that's come now, we are. And the outpatient -- we've always maintained hospitals, especially the central chiller plants, and they also look for more energy resilience in those places. So you're seeing things like combined heat and power and other things, but it's also a great maintenance opportunity for us on the sophisticated outpatient facilities. Reshoring and nearshoring, I'd like to say we were really seeing this trend in the Southeast and Southwest with all the things we talked about above. But really, we were headed towards building that capability in the Southeast because we believed in reshoring and nearshoring for quite some time. And the supply chains, I would say, got scarily consolidated into one facility. And for those of us that maybe grew up a little bit manufactured, we knew we should always have two sources of supply at a minimum of two plants. We got into a world where we're bringing all our supply out of one plant, our customers and our suppliers. And the pandemic and also the tensions with China and the cost in China proved that this wasn't a feasible strategy. So nearshoring or reshoring were happening before the pandemic. It's accelerating. And if you throw the geopolitical concerns on top of it, it's a good long-term trend for us. But it's a capacity not only expands the capacity is shifting, it's about resilience and it's about automation. And we're seeing that across just about any industry we work in. And finally, one of my favorite things is energy efficiency and sustainability. I personally have been around that almost going on 30 years now. It's amazing how far we've come in HVAC equipment and controls upgrades, but also our ability to implement those solutions that the manufacturers bring. If you think about efficiency, it's 50% better today than it was a mere 10 to 15 years ago. And we're doing that things with variable speed drives. We're doing that with control systems. We're doing that with sensors, and that sort of stuff we've been doing for a while. But now customers are also looking for water and waste reduction. Manufacturing plants are more into how they're managing their compressed air system, all their waste gases and also facilities rationalization and footprint rationalization that's accelerating as people do this reshoring, near shoring and supply chain resilience. They're also looking for energy resilience through alternative energy solutions. It could be anything from a combined heat and power off of a gas generator that then drives their chillers, to all the way through a solar on site of a megawatt or less, to backup generation that they may only use a few days a year, but they have to be able to have it because they don't trust the grid necessarily on a go-forward basis. That has had not only -- it's had utility incentives three years. It's had state incentives, and now there's going to be more federal government incentives on top of that. So as you go to page 13, you start to see that's really what's underlying these long-term trends, these trends that are big things is what's driving a lot of ways our RPO growth. And if you look at our RPO growth, I'm going to talk about some high-level things, and we can talk about strong demand across all these major themes. Our RPO is on page 13. At the end of the second quarter, we're almost $8.3 billion. That's up a little over $1.8 billion, like I talked about, 28% over the 2022 second quarter for a total of $6.5 billion last year. We had good bookings in the second quarter. We're up $827 million from the year-end period '22 and we're up $413 million from the end of the first quarter. So I'm going to give you some big trends out of those RPOs. Domestic construction RPO is up 33% versus the year ago period. Building Services RPO is up 14.5% versus the year ago period. Network & Communications, which includes our hyperscale data center work, stands at $1.2 billion, up 52% versus the year ago period. High-tech manufacturing sector, which includes semiconductors, pharma, biotech, life sciences, R&D in the electric vehicle value chain, are up 160% versus the year ago period, and they now total $1.2 billion. Health care RPO, as I talked about those trends there at the hospitals and outpatient facilities, up 50% versus the year ago period. Manufacturing and industrial, which points right towards reshoring, near shoring, capacity transition, flexibility expansion, they're up 35% versus the year ago period. So you see those trends manifesting themselves into our RPOs. Our bid log continues to remain strong, and we continue to see opportunities across these market sectors and other sectors. Other sector activity includes institutionals up 13%, short-duration projects, which includes a lot of the HVC retrofit, project work is up 7%. Reality is that's hit and stasis, right? We're getting used to the lead times. We're getting used to those extended lead times. That should be more of a book-and-ship business in the future as we deliver the projects that we booked 6 to 12 months ago. Partially offsetting that is a decrease in transportation and water and wastewater RPOs. They tend to be more episodic in their award, and we have a very good position in water and wastewater in some of the markets that matter most. And you've seen those big awards come in and out of our RPOs there. We do remain balanced in our market participation. We're winning new work in most active on the nonresidential sectors. And why are we doing that? One is the market is good, but we also have a very good position and we have excellent subsidiary and field leadership and segment leadership. We have the technical expertise. We have meticulous execution and our ability to work with our customers to achieve unique solutions along the entire design install, retrofit, repair, maintain, service continuum is strengthened every day. Now I'm going to turn to page 14 and 15, which is what most of you really care about. We're going to raise our diluted EPS guidance from a range of $9.25 to $10 to a range of $10.75 to $11.25. Our revenue guidance will remain unchanged at $12 billion to $12.5 billion. As are reflected in our RPOs, we are winning work in important and strategic market sectors. We are executing such work with efficiency and precision, and that's really shown by our record operating income margin. We believe that we will gain SG&A leverage as the year progresses, and we are utilizing our BIM prefabrication, labor management and supply management capabilities with an eye delivering -- to delivering superior results for our customers and growth and results for our shareholders. The supply chain remains challenging for any engineered or applied products or complex assemblies, but we have learned to mitigate these disruptions. As the year progresses, we expect some headwinds as our more traditional commercial customers will struggle with higher interest rates, in some cases, reduce building occupancy and potential liquidity issues. We always know that attracting skilled trade labor and developing trained frontline leadership is both a challenge and an opportunity, and we've always met it. And we believe that we will continue to be, through our subsidiaries, an employer of choice. We also believe that we are well positioned to navigate these headwinds, and we'll also have our eye on any disruption in the energy markets, and that will cause us to remain vigilant in our pricing and estimating. We're going to continue to be balanced capital allocators. There remains opportunity within our acquisition pipeline, and we believe that we will continue to add capability, geography and customers that will propel growth through our acquisition program, much like our recent announcement of the signing of ECM that we announced a few weeks ago. With the uncertainty in the financial markets, we believe our strong balance sheet -- we know, we not just believe that. We know that our strong balance sheet help us win work on large, sophisticated projects as a customer see our financial strength as another reason to choose EMCOR. I would be remiss if I didn't thank our entire EMCOR team for their dedication and hard work and discipline. We all appreciate all you do every day. And with that, I'll take questions. Megan, I'll turn it over to you, our operator.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson, Davis. Please go ahead.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey, good morning. Congrats on a good quarter and thanks for all the commentary on slide 12, Tony. I guess the biggest question is, how does that all wrap up into your thoughts on the prospect for continued sequential backlog growth?\nAnthony Guzzi: Yes. I mean, look, I've said it a thousand times. It's -- we're in a very good level of RPOs. We have opportunities in front of us. Projects, large awards come in. And because you booked it two weeks after the end of the quarter, it doesn't mean you've lost momentum in your business. Also, as you're out of site, and that site builds out like a new semiconductor site or some of these EV sites, sometimes the initial award is big. And then you get follow-on work that over a period of 18 months, which is a project less of a lot of these is every bit is big. But they -- because I know you, they tend to let it out in stages. So what I know is we have good momentum in the business. We're playing to broad themes that are driving our business and driving our sector and the economy. We have something that's very valuable, which is highly skilled technical labor that can execute the most difficult jobs and service the most -- drive service in the toughest situations. So I guess, in the 19 years I've done this, I've never thought about what sequential RPO or backlog growth looks like. I certainly have joined that we've had a book-to-bill of over 1 for I think 8 or 10 quarters in a row. I don't see maybe that's slowing down, but the flip side is if it was 0.98, I don't think that means much of anything, to be honest with you.\nAdam Thalhimer: Great. And then I hate to ask for guidance within the guidance, but can you give us any help on how you guys see the back half playing out between Q3 and Q4?\nAnthony Guzzi: We have. You know what? This is all project timing-related. When a turnaround starts and ends, we've never provided quarterly guidance, and I don't think we're going to start now. Are we Mark?\nMark Pompa: No, we're not.\nAdam Thalhimer: And then lastly, fire protection. Can you give us a sense for how accretive that is to mechanical margins?\nAnthony Guzzi: Well, it operates at better margins than the base business. Some of that has to do with the material component of those jobs. It has a higher labor component, but it's helping. It's providing a nice cap on it. But you know, it's a tough job, so we've got to execute.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay, I'll turn it over. Might hop back in. Thanks so much.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]\nAnthony Guzzi: Hey, Adam. Hop back in if you want.\nOperator: Sure. Go ahead.\nAnthony Guzzi: All right.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. Sorry I did want to ask about the shop business. When was the last time the shop business was strong? I can't even remember.\nAnthony Guzzi: 2018, '17, '18.\nAdam Thalhimer: And how meaningful could that be to that segment?\nAnthony Guzzi: It's not nonmeaningful.\nAdam Thalhimer: And also on my list, I had solar. When you thought that might gain traction?\nAnthony Guzzi: There's probably people better qualified than me to talk about that because of where we are in the chain to deliver those projects. There's a lot of things on the drawing board. There's a lot of land bought. There's a lot of contracts. Purchase power agreement is out there. We had a full book of business. I expected to do 10%, 12% revenue of that segment. But the reality is, there's not a lot happening there right now. Now the smaller ones are happening. So when we're on a hospital site or a campus site where we're doing the car ports, actually, one of our suppliers is doing that as part of our overall energy program for some of our bigger customers. We can get them there. When you're talking utility scale solar, and again, I think there's probably people that are better qualified to me to talk about that. We're just not seeing the activity we expected to see this year.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. All right. Thanks guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nSean Eastman: Hi, Team. Many compliments. Really fantastic update here. So I wanted to talk a little bit more about the margins, which is really the big upside toggle and the outlook for the year. Obviously, we had a really strong start on margins in the first quarter, but you guys kind of held back from flowing through that really strong start to the year. And then here we are in 2Q, kind of blowing out margin expectation, and you guys are releasing more of that kind of elevated margin and a juicier guidance update. So I just wanted to get a sense for what changed in your view? And what's kind of come through stronger to give you more confidence to just guide margins up from here versus last quarter?\nAnthony Guzzi: Yes. So I'll take a high-level view, and then I'll turn it over to Mark. I think there's three things that we have more confidence in. One is the mix of our work going forward, and we have pretty good visibility on what we're nearing completion in and what's starting up, at least we think we do at this point in the year. The second point is the mix of trades. We have a very good mix of trades. We have strong fire life safety demand. Our electrical business is back on track with a great mix of work. In our core mechanical business, mechanical services businesses are all performing well. Coupled with, we see a pretty normal fall turnaround season. So I think that -- at a high level, that mix of things, and I'll let Mark get into more of the specifics.\nMark Pompa: Yes, Sean. I think clearly, and not to rehash history, but quarter 1, from a seasonality perspective, tends to be one of our weakest quarters in the year, despite the fact that our Industrial Services segment is executing in the earlier periods of the spring turnaround season. I think when you look back to where we were exiting last year and certainly, where we were a year ago at this time, and Tony and I both have commented on this multiple times during the call, the revenue mix was good. It certainly wasn't bad, but we certainly had some projects in the mix that were marginal contributors or they were in loss positions. So I think the term of absence of badness that we've used many times in the past is certainly, relevant or germane to the 2023 periods. And that work other than one project is all cleaned up at this point. So that's a good thing from an activity perspective. The other thing, and we talked about supply chain many times, and we're certainly not saying that it's great, but it's certainly more normalized as we sit here in late July of 2023 than it certainly was at the midpoint of last year. So we're seeing flow of equipment from the OEMs, and that's giving us the ability to make sure we're utilizing our labor in the most efficient manner possible, which is driving better margins. And then specifically, I know I mentioned this in my prepared commentary, in the mechanical -- US Mechanical Construction segment, we did have some favorable project closeout. So back to the earlier caller's point, we only control the start and stop the projects based on our customer's project time line. To the extent that we execute in the fixed price environment or arena, on a better basis, then we obviously capture that improvement. And ultimately, we recognize it where it's appropriate. We certainly had that phenomenon in the second quarter. And as we look at the book of business, as we progress to the rest of 2023, we don't see any particular problematic areas other than the fact that we have thousands of active projects out there with, certainly, a very, very large deployed workforce that we need to make sure is executing at an exceptional level as we've demonstrated over a long period of time. So kind of a long-winded answer. Ultimately, the book of business is very, very strong. We're happy with the labor complement we have on the jobs. And the operating environment is still not optimal with regards to things that are outside of our control, but we've certainly seen some stabilization, which is giving us a little bit more positive momentum as we look at the outlook for the business.\nAnthony Guzzi: Right. Bottom line is, we called revenue about right at the beginning of the year, but our margins are 100 basis points higher than -- 125 basis points higher than we thought they were going to be.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And do you think that we're setting tough margin comps here in 2023? Or do you feel like in light of the mix of work in the pipeline, the complexity of projects driving RPOs and the bid pipeline, that there's some differentiation in the marketplace that perhaps we haven't seen before? And we could view this performance we're seeing here as sustainable?\nAnthony Guzzi: Sean, I've said a long time, I go back to the way Adam asked about backlog or RPO, I think about margins the same way. One quarter doesn't make a trend. We look over four or fivequarters to see a trend. Margins could go up or down. It could be nothing more than starting up jobs, mix of jobs, mix of contracts. And I said this, I think, last year, after we got out of the first quarter where we had some of the tougher work that was taken pre-pandemic, and we didn't start up the -- especially the data center work we expected to in the Electrical segment. And I said last year, we look at underlying productivity. We look at the things we're doing to drive productive. You got to remember, as a contractor, we don't get to keep the productivity in a sense that a manufacturing plant does. But what we do get to keep is the ideas, and the idea is that we're driving that productivity. So quarter-to-quarter, they could fluctuate some. We definitely think, as we're guiding to, we believe we're going to have strong margin performance for the rest of the year. We, obviously, are at all-time level and RPOs. We like the mix of working at RPOs. But hey, we got to go out and execute. We got to have customers that hang in there with us, and we will.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Got it. And then just kind of going back to your end market drivers commentary, Tony. I mean we look at the RPO disclosure as kind of a leading indicator of demand. And I wondered if you would say that perhaps there's greater visibility in the model, then we can even really observe in the RPO disclosure, just in light of there being more programmatic and larger multiyear programs.Just kind of more complex infrastructure challenges driving the business that would suggest perhaps you have more of a multiyear type of visibility that isn't fully captured in what we see in RPO? What would you say there?\nAnthony Guzzi: Yes. What I think I said while I was going through that page, page 12, I said, as a contractor, we don't try to bring big sweeping conclusions on 5-year outlooks. But I think what I said is, I didn't know exactly how things would layer in, but that these six things that we were driving our RPOs right now, that we had a pretty good feeling that they were going to continue to drive our business for the next 2 to 3 years. How that manifests itself is I think exact words I used something like that, how manifests itself quarter-to-quarter. I don't know. But I do know that we're well positioned in some really critical, as you would say, infrastructure type -- not the big I infrastructure, but the small I infrastructure-type sectors that we feel really good about. But guess what, Sean, we're going to go out and execute every day. And we get graded every day by our customers. We get graded every day. And look, the site might be great for 5 years, but in any one of these sites, they could take a 6-month pause. And we have nothing that we -- there's nothing we could do about that. And you saw that last year in the data center business, right? Our electrical business has a wonderful position in the data center market. And just about every key geographic market that matters. We have a wonderful position, but we also have competition every day. But coupled with that, we don't necessarily control when things are going to start. So last year, we thought we were going to start a bunch of work in the first quarter. And what we told everybody, look, it didn't start. That has all kinds of implications, maybe for a little underabsorption of our supervision. Why didn't it start? Well, it mainly didn't start because the switchgear was eight weeks late. The smart panels were six weeks late. The generators were 5 weeks late. So they are owner procured materials. So instead of starting those jobs, February 1, we started most of those jobs May 1. And we ate the supervision in the meantime because we certainly weren't going to lose our key supervision that we plan on working for us for the next 10 years. So the trend is great, right? And so I've given questions the last first quarter is just the end of the data center build. And we said, no.\" And here we are with $1.2 billion in network and communications, RPOs. So the RPO is dual story, but in a lot of ways, it's not a quarter-to-quarter story.\nSean Eastman: Yes. I think it's notable for you to be talking 2 to 3 years. If you just look at the long-term history of the business for you to be out kind of seeing robust trends out over multiple years, I think, in itself is notable.\nAnthony Guzzi: Yes. Well, I think it's -- you can't run from success that you've had where you've entrenched yourself into really good positions. But again, our customers can make a decision not to build in a certain way. I think we'll perform. I don't think that's going to be an issue, but they can delay things by a year. They can delay things by six months. We see none of that today, but we can be talking very different in the first quarter of next year. It doesn't mean it's not a long good term trend. It just means, hey, they took a pause.\nSean Eastman: Got it. I really appreciate all the insights. I'm going to go see what Brian Lane has to say now.\nAnthony Guzzi: All right. Thank you.\nSean Eastman: Bye, guys.\nAnthony Guzzi: Bye-bye.\nAnthony Guzzi: Okay. I think that's it. Thank you all and have a safe rest of summer. Pay attention to the heat and drink a lot of water. Be well. Bye.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Anthony Guzzi",
            "content": "Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, and thanks for joining our call. I will be speaking to the second quarter results in my opening commentary. Mark is going to cover both the second quarter and year-to-date results. I will be speaking to pages four through six in my opening comments. We had an extraordinarily strong second quarter, by any measure, at EMCOR. We had revenues of $3.05 billion, which represents 12.5% revenue growth and 11% organic revenue growth. We earned $196.7 million in operating income, and our operating income margin was a strong 6.5%. Diluted earnings per share totaled $2.95. This performance represents an all-time quarterly record for revenues, operating income, operating income margin and diluted earnings per share. We generated strong operating cash flow of $300 million in the quarter and grew our remaining performance obligations or RPO sequentially from Q1 by $413 million or 5.2%, and from the year ago period by $1.8 billion or just over 28%. Our business is performing well across nearly all segments and end markets. Our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments continue to perform well as evidenced by the strong revenue growth of 20.2% and 12.9%, respectively. With Mechanical Construction operating income margin of 10% and Electrical Construction operating income margin of 7.5%, the conversion to operating income by these segments, especially Mechanical, are towards the high end of our expectations. Across the country, we are executing well on some of the most sophisticated projects and markets, such as high-tech manufacturing, which includes semiconductors, the electric vehicle, or EV value chain, biotech, life sciences and pharmaceuticals. The network and communications sector, which encompasses our data center work and the health care sector, are also performing well. We have industry-leading capabilities in BIM or Building Information Modeling, prefabrication, project planning, labor sourcing, management and training. We offer a breadth of mechanical capabilities from HVAC, process piping, plumbing, and we're also a fire -- leading fire protection and life safety contractor, and our customers look to us to perform complex installation in the markets I just referenced. Our segment and subsidiary management teams are leading in an exceptional manner and allocating resources in a thoughtful and pragmatic way, while working towards outstanding outcomes for our customers. We continue to strive to optimize our project mix to produce great financial results. Our US Building Services segment continues to perform well, and it has a strong mix of work across its service lines. Revenue of this segment grew 12.9% in the quarter, with an operating income margin of 6%. Demand continues to be strong and persists for our mechanical services, with excellent execution across retrofit projects, building controls and maintenance and repairs. We are working across a variety of end markets, including traditional commercial markets, but also high-tech manufacturing, institutional and health care customers who remain focused on energy efficiency in indoor air quality, or IAQ upgrades. We expect to have a strong repair service season because of the heat that has blanket most parts of the country as well as extended lead times for applied equipment. This segment continues to enter into facility maintenance contracts, and there are strong demand for our site-based and rob technician services. We're also excited about our pending acquisition of ECM. ECM is a bolt-on acquisition that adds capability. ECM will enhance our energy efficiency service offerings and will allow us to offer such services in a more programmatic way to owners looking for multisite and multiyear programs. Welcome to EMCOR, the ECM folks soon. Our Industrial Services segment continues to improve at a modest pace. We executed a more normal spring turnaround season, and demand for our niche services is robust. Within our shop services, we are beginning to see increased levels of capital spending in the form of greater new build heat exchanger orders. We continue to wait for the resumption of demand for utility scale solar and are well positioned when the supply chain issues subside. Our UK business performed in a manner consistent with the available market opportunities. While we saw a reduction in quarterly revenues, the team remains focused on profitability, as evidenced by the consistent year-over-year second quarter operating income margin. Building on its normal base of facility services contract, EMCOR UK. continues to perform various project work for its customers, much of which is aimed at helping develop and implement multiyear energy reduction programs. Overall, EMCOR continues to have a strong balance sheet that supports our organic growth and the capital investment needed for that growth. We also have the firepower to add bolt-on acquisitions, like ECM, we hope to close soon, that help us expand our capabilities in support of our customers. With that, Mark, I'm going to turn it over to you. Thanks, Mark, and I'm going to be on page 12. And what I wanted to do before we jump into the remaining performance obligation's absolute levels, is I wanted to take a step back and talk about what's been driving our exceptional organic growth and our RPO growth over the last two years, and what's been driving profitable organic growth for us. And if you look at this page, I want to take a step back also and say, if you look at these trends we're talking about on Page 12, they're front and center in the news every day. They're not only front and center from customers making investments, they're also the focus of government policy, in some cases, to strengthen those sectors for the long term. Secondarily, each one of these sectors require highly skilled labor, very skilled supervision, project managers and engineers that are really at the top of the industry. And the government incentives, where they're aiding in certain cases, want that kind of workforce on those jobs because it's more productive, it's safer and it's trained. And again, going back to the great supervision point. So let's talk about each of these in turn, and there's a little bit connectivity between a couple of them, and I'll talk about that. The first one is electrification and the EV, or electric vehicle value chain. In a lot of ways, that's a whole new industry, right, that's being built in plants, suppliers -- second- and third-tier suppliers, and we're certainly seeing that work in battery plants, which is the raw material. And we're certainly seeing that work really burgeoning across the country, especially in the mid-central part of the country in Midwest and also the Southeast and a little bit in the Southwest. We are participating on a lot of these efforts, and there's more to come. And I will say that the pace and timing of actual delivery has been a little slower, but we continue to see the work and book the work, and we're very bullish on the sector. And it's across all of our trades. It's electrical work, mechanical work and fire life safety. And this is an area where our fire life safety products are in great demand because we can provide a comprehensive solution of not only the wet side, the sprinkler, but also the fire alarm to give these folks that are starting these facilities the assurance that we can deliver these complex systems. We're also participating in EV charging stations, but we're doing it at scale. So what we're doing is we're bringing in lots of megawatts to supply an EV charging station for a fleet or also our big centralized hub. We will -- I'm sure, across EMCOR, we're participating in the local installations, but we're not really participating in any significant way in national rollouts of individual passenger car rollouts. Again, we will do some of that work, but the stuff that we like to do is megawatt-driven, high-scale charging stations. We also believe the electrification also leads to an energy transition. But I think, at EMCOR, we believe more and more every day, it's an energy expansion. So think about all of the things on this page, they all require a lot of energy. And it's going to be a mix of all kinds of energy and all kind of solutions to make that energy cleaner. And this part of the trends that are driving our growth in RPOs, I think we're in the first couple of innings of. And I think the government incentives that have been put out through the various acts and you've heard us talk about those, will allow that momentum to continue. It wasn't the advent of what was happening, but it certainly will provide bolstering to those trends continuing. The next part is actually work that we're actively involved in today. And we see that -- and we're still on the front end as these new sites get built out. Let me give you an example, semiconductor manufacturing. What you read in the paper, a lot of the semiconductor build was happening or planned and it's going to be bolstered by the CHIPS Act. We're participating in a number of ways. We're participating mechanically, and we participate in some markets on the high-purity piping and others. We do quote in a form -- semi, the dirty side, which is far from dirty, but it's more of the HVAC and process cooling. We do both. And it depends on the capability of our subsidiary in that market and what the best mix of work that we can bring to bear in that market. We're participating electrically, especially on the low-voltage communication side, and we're participating with fire life safety across multiple plants across the country. When you go to the pharma biotech life sciences R&D, let me take the first two, pharma and biotech. That's actually coupled with what I'm going to talk about later on reshoring nearshoring. So we're seeing reshoring of the pharma industry to bring resilience to the supply chain, but we're also seeing as new drugs get built, like Ozempic, right, where people need to build capacity to build it up. And it's in areas where we are well positioned to do the work, and it's across all of our trades, but especially mechanically in fire life safety. The pharma area of RTP, Research Triangle Park, big pharma area, Southern New Jersey, Northeastern Pennsylvania, Indiana and Southern California are all big pharma areas. And it's areas where we'll have done the work over time. We have the trust of the customers, and we're well positioned to deliver that work for the long term. As you go to the life sciences R&D, that's much more expansive. R&D facilities are happening in commercial conversions. They're happening in just about every major medical center that we work in, and they're happening also as part of more incubator startup-type companies, where we're helping build out the facilities, and in life sciences is the same thing there. Again, go to the semiconductor part, we believe that the CHIPS Act will continue to cement those sites as long-term build, and it's a national security issue. So we think that has long-term build. And when you understand the semiconductor market, once you're on a site and if you're doing good work, you get add-on work on that site to build the next fab, expand the fab, do the process cooling work. The next one, if you go to the right -- upper right, is data centers and connectivity. Through various calls, a lot of questions have been asked, do we see the data center build slowing down? We said no. And we said, WELL, maybe that's because we're a late cycle.\" The reality is you got to figure the big data center owners and -- especially the -- both the REITs and the five big ones to build it. They understood that they were going to need more capacity. And so they secured the land, the facilities and it kept building because of really, what's driving it now is not only the increased need for storage and more cloud computing, which companies like EMCOR, or big companies like us are doing more every day, but also AI. AI is accelerating more build-out and it's more robust build up. So when we started building data centers 20 years ago, we thought a 5- to 10-megawatt data center was a big data center, which, by the way, 10, 15 megawatts is what a big assembly plant actually uses in the automotive, maybe 20. So think about what you see there. Now -- then we move to 40, then we moved to 50 to 75. The data centers, hyperscale that we're building now are somewhere between 75 and 125 megawatts of power. Put into perspective, right, you need 5,000 -- you need 1,500 acres and 600,000 panels to generate 200 megawatts. That gives you an idea where you need an LM 8,000 from GE. You need half of the production of one of those gas turbines to support one data center. So just think of the scale of these data centers, and go back to the first block of why we think it's more of an energy expansion and also an energy transition at the same time. And that is a long-term trend. We're also going back and remodeling and adding more power to data centers that we built a mere 5 to 7 years ago, and that has just started. So we see a strong data center market. We're contractors, so 2 to 3 years is an outlook for us. But we see a strong data center market for the foreseeable future. Going to the bottom left in health care, we've always been bullish on health care. A health care system is as complex as any of the three things above, right, a major hospital. Every system comes to bear in an operating room, a patient room, an ICU bed, or a very sophisticated outpatient clinic. And what the pandemic taught people, we, certainly, participate in helping people make their hospitals more flexible is that's got to be permanent. And so you're seeing more robust patient power build than we've seen in 5, 8 years. And it's also coupled with more sophisticated outpatient facilities. We really didn't participate previously a lot in outpatient facilities, but with the sophistication level that's come now, we are. And the outpatient -- we've always maintained hospitals, especially the central chiller plants, and they also look for more energy resilience in those places. So you're seeing things like combined heat and power and other things, but it's also a great maintenance opportunity for us on the sophisticated outpatient facilities. Reshoring and nearshoring, I'd like to say we were really seeing this trend in the Southeast and Southwest with all the things we talked about above. But really, we were headed towards building that capability in the Southeast because we believed in reshoring and nearshoring for quite some time. And the supply chains, I would say, got scarily consolidated into one facility. And for those of us that maybe grew up a little bit manufactured, we knew we should always have two sources of supply at a minimum of two plants. We got into a world where we're bringing all our supply out of one plant, our customers and our suppliers. And the pandemic and also the tensions with China and the cost in China proved that this wasn't a feasible strategy. So nearshoring or reshoring were happening before the pandemic. It's accelerating. And if you throw the geopolitical concerns on top of it, it's a good long-term trend for us. But it's a capacity not only expands the capacity is shifting, it's about resilience and it's about automation. And we're seeing that across just about any industry we work in. And finally, one of my favorite things is energy efficiency and sustainability. I personally have been around that almost going on 30 years now. It's amazing how far we've come in HVAC equipment and controls upgrades, but also our ability to implement those solutions that the manufacturers bring. If you think about efficiency, it's 50% better today than it was a mere 10 to 15 years ago. And we're doing that things with variable speed drives. We're doing that with control systems. We're doing that with sensors, and that sort of stuff we've been doing for a while. But now customers are also looking for water and waste reduction. Manufacturing plants are more into how they're managing their compressed air system, all their waste gases and also facilities rationalization and footprint rationalization that's accelerating as people do this reshoring, near shoring and supply chain resilience. They're also looking for energy resilience through alternative energy solutions. It could be anything from a combined heat and power off of a gas generator that then drives their chillers, to all the way through a solar on site of a megawatt or less, to backup generation that they may only use a few days a year, but they have to be able to have it because they don't trust the grid necessarily on a go-forward basis. That has had not only -- it's had utility incentives three years. It's had state incentives, and now there's going to be more federal government incentives on top of that. So as you go to page 13, you start to see that's really what's underlying these long-term trends, these trends that are big things is what's driving a lot of ways our RPO growth. And if you look at our RPO growth, I'm going to talk about some high-level things, and we can talk about strong demand across all these major themes. Our RPO is on page 13. At the end of the second quarter, we're almost $8.3 billion. That's up a little over $1.8 billion, like I talked about, 28% over the 2022 second quarter for a total of $6.5 billion last year. We had good bookings in the second quarter. We're up $827 million from the year-end period '22 and we're up $413 million from the end of the first quarter. So I'm going to give you some big trends out of those RPOs. Domestic construction RPO is up 33% versus the year ago period. Building Services RPO is up 14.5% versus the year ago period. Network & Communications, which includes our hyperscale data center work, stands at $1.2 billion, up 52% versus the year ago period. High-tech manufacturing sector, which includes semiconductors, pharma, biotech, life sciences, R&D in the electric vehicle value chain, are up 160% versus the year ago period, and they now total $1.2 billion. Health care RPO, as I talked about those trends there at the hospitals and outpatient facilities, up 50% versus the year ago period. Manufacturing and industrial, which points right towards reshoring, near shoring, capacity transition, flexibility expansion, they're up 35% versus the year ago period. So you see those trends manifesting themselves into our RPOs. Our bid log continues to remain strong, and we continue to see opportunities across these market sectors and other sectors. Other sector activity includes institutionals up 13%, short-duration projects, which includes a lot of the HVC retrofit, project work is up 7%. Reality is that's hit and stasis, right? We're getting used to the lead times. We're getting used to those extended lead times. That should be more of a book-and-ship business in the future as we deliver the projects that we booked 6 to 12 months ago. Partially offsetting that is a decrease in transportation and water and wastewater RPOs. They tend to be more episodic in their award, and we have a very good position in water and wastewater in some of the markets that matter most. And you've seen those big awards come in and out of our RPOs there. We do remain balanced in our market participation. We're winning new work in most active on the nonresidential sectors. And why are we doing that? One is the market is good, but we also have a very good position and we have excellent subsidiary and field leadership and segment leadership. We have the technical expertise. We have meticulous execution and our ability to work with our customers to achieve unique solutions along the entire design install, retrofit, repair, maintain, service continuum is strengthened every day. Now I'm going to turn to page 14 and 15, which is what most of you really care about. We're going to raise our diluted EPS guidance from a range of $9.25 to $10 to a range of $10.75 to $11.25. Our revenue guidance will remain unchanged at $12 billion to $12.5 billion. As are reflected in our RPOs, we are winning work in important and strategic market sectors. We are executing such work with efficiency and precision, and that's really shown by our record operating income margin. We believe that we will gain SG&A leverage as the year progresses, and we are utilizing our BIM prefabrication, labor management and supply management capabilities with an eye delivering -- to delivering superior results for our customers and growth and results for our shareholders. The supply chain remains challenging for any engineered or applied products or complex assemblies, but we have learned to mitigate these disruptions. As the year progresses, we expect some headwinds as our more traditional commercial customers will struggle with higher interest rates, in some cases, reduce building occupancy and potential liquidity issues. We always know that attracting skilled trade labor and developing trained frontline leadership is both a challenge and an opportunity, and we've always met it. And we believe that we will continue to be, through our subsidiaries, an employer of choice. We also believe that we are well positioned to navigate these headwinds, and we'll also have our eye on any disruption in the energy markets, and that will cause us to remain vigilant in our pricing and estimating. We're going to continue to be balanced capital allocators. There remains opportunity within our acquisition pipeline, and we believe that we will continue to add capability, geography and customers that will propel growth through our acquisition program, much like our recent announcement of the signing of ECM that we announced a few weeks ago. With the uncertainty in the financial markets, we believe our strong balance sheet -- we know, we not just believe that. We know that our strong balance sheet help us win work on large, sophisticated projects as a customer see our financial strength as another reason to choose EMCOR. I would be remiss if I didn't thank our entire EMCOR team for their dedication and hard work and discipline. We all appreciate all you do every day. And with that, I'll take questions. Megan, I'll turn it over to you, our operator. Yes. I mean, look, I've said it a thousand times. It's -- we're in a very good level of RPOs. We have opportunities in front of us. Projects, large awards come in. And because you booked it two weeks after the end of the quarter, it doesn't mean you've lost momentum in your business. Also, as you're out of site, and that site builds out like a new semiconductor site or some of these EV sites, sometimes the initial award is big. And then you get follow-on work that over a period of 18 months, which is a project less of a lot of these is every bit is big. But they -- because I know you, they tend to let it out in stages. So what I know is we have good momentum in the business. We're playing to broad themes that are driving our business and driving our sector and the economy. We have something that's very valuable, which is highly skilled technical labor that can execute the most difficult jobs and service the most -- drive service in the toughest situations. So I guess, in the 19 years I've done this, I've never thought about what sequential RPO or backlog growth looks like. I certainly have joined that we've had a book-to-bill of over 1 for I think 8 or 10 quarters in a row. I don't see maybe that's slowing down, but the flip side is if it was 0.98, I don't think that means much of anything, to be honest with you. We have. You know what? This is all project timing-related. When a turnaround starts and ends, we've never provided quarterly guidance, and I don't think we're going to start now. Are we Mark? Well, it operates at better margins than the base business. Some of that has to do with the material component of those jobs. It has a higher labor component, but it's helping. It's providing a nice cap on it. But you know, it's a tough job, so we've got to execute. Hey, Adam. Hop back in if you want. All right. 2018, '17, '18. It's not nonmeaningful. There's probably people better qualified than me to talk about that because of where we are in the chain to deliver those projects. There's a lot of things on the drawing board. There's a lot of land bought. There's a lot of contracts. Purchase power agreement is out there. We had a full book of business. I expected to do 10%, 12% revenue of that segment. But the reality is, there's not a lot happening there right now. Now the smaller ones are happening. So when we're on a hospital site or a campus site where we're doing the car ports, actually, one of our suppliers is doing that as part of our overall energy program for some of our bigger customers. We can get them there. When you're talking utility scale solar, and again, I think there's probably people that are better qualified to me to talk about that. We're just not seeing the activity we expected to see this year. Yes. So I'll take a high-level view, and then I'll turn it over to Mark. I think there's three things that we have more confidence in. One is the mix of our work going forward, and we have pretty good visibility on what we're nearing completion in and what's starting up, at least we think we do at this point in the year. The second point is the mix of trades. We have a very good mix of trades. We have strong fire life safety demand. Our electrical business is back on track with a great mix of work. In our core mechanical business, mechanical services businesses are all performing well. Coupled with, we see a pretty normal fall turnaround season. So I think that -- at a high level, that mix of things, and I'll let Mark get into more of the specifics. Right. Bottom line is, we called revenue about right at the beginning of the year, but our margins are 100 basis points higher than -- 125 basis points higher than we thought they were going to be. Sean, I've said a long time, I go back to the way Adam asked about backlog or RPO, I think about margins the same way. One quarter doesn't make a trend. We look over four or fivequarters to see a trend. Margins could go up or down. It could be nothing more than starting up jobs, mix of jobs, mix of contracts. And I said this, I think, last year, after we got out of the first quarter where we had some of the tougher work that was taken pre-pandemic, and we didn't start up the -- especially the data center work we expected to in the Electrical segment. And I said last year, we look at underlying productivity. We look at the things we're doing to drive productive. You got to remember, as a contractor, we don't get to keep the productivity in a sense that a manufacturing plant does. But what we do get to keep is the ideas, and the idea is that we're driving that productivity. So quarter-to-quarter, they could fluctuate some. We definitely think, as we're guiding to, we believe we're going to have strong margin performance for the rest of the year. We, obviously, are at all-time level and RPOs. We like the mix of working at RPOs. But hey, we got to go out and execute. We got to have customers that hang in there with us, and we will. Yes. What I think I said while I was going through that page, page 12, I said, as a contractor, we don't try to bring big sweeping conclusions on 5-year outlooks. But I think what I said is, I didn't know exactly how things would layer in, but that these six things that we were driving our RPOs right now, that we had a pretty good feeling that they were going to continue to drive our business for the next 2 to 3 years. How that manifests itself is I think exact words I used something like that, how manifests itself quarter-to-quarter. I don't know. But I do know that we're well positioned in some really critical, as you would say, infrastructure type -- not the big I infrastructure, but the small I infrastructure-type sectors that we feel really good about. But guess what, Sean, we're going to go out and execute every day. And we get graded every day by our customers. We get graded every day. And look, the site might be great for 5 years, but in any one of these sites, they could take a 6-month pause. And we have nothing that we -- there's nothing we could do about that. And you saw that last year in the data center business, right? Our electrical business has a wonderful position in the data center market. And just about every key geographic market that matters. We have a wonderful position, but we also have competition every day. But coupled with that, we don't necessarily control when things are going to start. So last year, we thought we were going to start a bunch of work in the first quarter. And what we told everybody, look, it didn't start. That has all kinds of implications, maybe for a little underabsorption of our supervision. Why didn't it start? Well, it mainly didn't start because the switchgear was eight weeks late. The smart panels were six weeks late. The generators were 5 weeks late. So they are owner procured materials. So instead of starting those jobs, February 1, we started most of those jobs May 1. And we ate the supervision in the meantime because we certainly weren't going to lose our key supervision that we plan on working for us for the next 10 years. So the trend is great, right? And so I've given questions the last first quarter is just the end of the data center build. And we said, no.\" And here we are with $1.2 billion in network and communications, RPOs. So the RPO is dual story, but in a lot of ways, it's not a quarter-to-quarter story. Yes. Well, I think it's -- you can't run from success that you've had where you've entrenched yourself into really good positions. But again, our customers can make a decision not to build in a certain way. I think we'll perform. I don't think that's going to be an issue, but they can delay things by a year. They can delay things by six months. We see none of that today, but we can be talking very different in the first quarter of next year. It doesn't mean it's not a long good term trend. It just means, hey, they took a pause. All right. Thank you. Bye-bye. Okay. I think that's it. Thank you all and have a safe rest of summer. Pay attention to the heat and drink a lot of water. Be well. Bye."

            "name": "Mark Pompa",
            "content": "Thank you, Tony, and good morning to everyone participating on the call today. For those accessing this presentation via the webcast, we are now on slide seee. Over the next several slides, I will supplement Tony's opening commentary on EMCOR's second quarter performance as well as provide a brief snapshot of our year-to-date results through June 30. All financial information referenced this morning is derived from our consolidated financial statements, included in both our earnings release announcement and Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this morning. So let's revisit and expand our review of EMCOR's second quarter performance. Consolidated revenues of $3.05 billion are up $338.2 million, or 12.5%, over quarter tw2022. Our second quarter results include $40.6 million of revenues attributable to businesses acquired, pertaining to the time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in last year's second quarter. Acquisition revenues positively impacted our United States Electrical Construction segment within the quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, second quarter consolidated revenues increased approximately $297.6 million or 11% quarter-over-quarter. Before reviewing the operating results of our individual reporting segments, I would like to reiterate what Tony highlighted earlier, that our $3.05 billion of quarterly revenues represents a new all-time quarterly revenue record for the company. The specifics to each of our reportable segment's second quarter revenue performance is as follows. United States Electrical Construction segment revenues of $678.2 million increased $114 million or 20.2% from 2022's comparable quarter. Excluding incremental acquisition revenues, the segment's revenues grew a strong 13% organically period-over-period. Increased project activity within the majority of the market sectors served by this segment led to the quarterly revenue improvement. Such growth was most prevalent within the network and communications, manufacturing and industrial, health care and hospitality market sectors. Revenue of this segment were also positively impacted by slightly improved supply chain environment with regards to equipment procurement. Revenues of our United States Mechanical Construction segment of $1.19 billion increased $136.5 billion or 12.9% from the year ago period. Revenue growth during the quarter was largely driven from increased activity within the high-tech manufacturing, network and communications and commercial market sectors. Consistent with this segment's first quarter performance, we are experiencing growth in both fire protection as well as traditional mechanical construction services. This increased demand is stemming from customer projects supporting the design and manufacturer of semiconductors as well as electric vehicles and/or related battery technologies. There additionally continues to be greater demand from our data center customers. With these results, both our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments established new second quarter revenue records. Additionally, our combined U.S. construction revenues as well as that of our U.S. Mechanical Construction segment surpassed the previous all-time quarterly revenue records. United States Building Services segment revenues of $775 million increased $88.5 million or 12.9%, representing an all-time quarterly record for this segment. Revenue growth was experienced across each of the divisions, with the majority being generated from mechanical services. Contributing to this performance was increased HVAC project and retrofit revenues due to slightly improved equipment availability that facilitated greater project execution when compared to 2022. In addition, as commented during prior quarters, this segment continues to experience strong demand for certain of its service offerings as our customers seek ways to improve the energy efficiency and/or indoor air quality of their facilities. EMCOR's Industrial Services segment revenues of $292.3 million increased $7.7 million or 2.7% as we continue to experience a resumption in demand for our field services and are starting to see increased levels of capital spending within this segment's shop services. United Kingdom Building Services segment revenues of $106 million represents a reduction of $8.5 million or 7.4% from last year's second quarter. In addition to a minor degradation in the exchange rate between the British pound and the United States dollar, the period-over-period revenue decline as a result of the loss of certain facilities maintenance contracts due to nonrenewal. Further contributing to this decrease in revenues is a reduction in project activity, as certain of the segment's customers are re-evaluating their capital spending programs in light of the macroeconomic headwinds within the UK. Please turn to slide eight. Reported operating income for the quarter was $196.7 million or 6.5% of revenues and favorably compares to $137.6 million of operating income, or 5.1% of revenues a year ago. Consistent with my revenue commentary and Tony's opening remarks, the current quarter's consolidated operating income and operating margin each represent new all-time quarterly records for EMCORE. Specific operating performance by segment is as follows: our US. Electrical Construction segment earned operating income of $50.7 million, an increase of $15.6 million from the comparable 2022 period. Reported operating margin of 7.5% represents an improvement from the 6.2%. And last year's second quarter, consistent with the segment's first quarter performance, we experienced better project execution as well as a more favorable revenue mix year-over-year. Such execution, coupled with a steady improvement within the supply chain and our ability to adapt to the current operating environment, resulted in a reduced level of discrete project write-downs quarter-over-quarter. Second quarter operating income of our US Mechanical Construction segment of $119.8 million represents a $43.2 million increase from last year's quarter and operating margin of 10% represents a substantial improvement from an already strong 7.2% in the second quarter of 2022. Growth in both gross profit and gross profit margin, due to a more favorable revenue mix, including a higher percentage of self-perform projects, were the most significant contributors to this improved operating performance. In addition, the segment benefited from a lack of significant project write-downs when compared to last year, as well as the favorable closeout of several projects during the current year quarter. Operating income for US Building Services was $46.1 million or 6% of revenues and compares to $38.5 million or 5.6% of revenues in 2022 second quarter. Improved operating performance within the segment's Mechanical Services division, as a result of both favorable project execution as well as the impact of contract price adjustments in response to inflation, were the primary drivers of the period-over-period increases. Our US Industrial Services segment's operating income was $7.9 million, or 2.7% of revenues, represents a slight increase in terms of both dollars and margin from the comparable prior year period. We are seeing incremental demand across the segment's scope of services, which has led to a better mix of revenues and resulted in higher gross profit and gross profit margin. Resulting from the reduction in revenues previously referenced, UK Building Services operating income of $5.9 million represents a modest decrease from Q2 of 2022. However, operating margin of 5.6% remains consistent with that of the prior year, reflecting greater gross profit contribution from this segment's current portfolio of work. We are now on slide 9. Additional financial items of significance for the quarter not addressed in the previous slides are as follows. Quarter two gross profit of $490.1 million is higher than the comparable 2022 quarter by $107.1 million or 28%, and gross margin of 16.1% has improved 200 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately $293.4 million represent 9.6% of revenues and reflect an increase of $48 million from quarter two 2022 SG&A for the current year's quarter includes approximately $5.1 million of incremental expenses from businesses acquired, inclusive of intangible asset amortization, resulting in an organic SG&A increase of $42.9 million. EMCORE's continued double-digit revenue growth has necessitated investments in human capital in the form of additional personnel and training to support our back-office and contract administration functions. This, coupled with annual cost of living increases for our existing workforce, has resulted in a quarter-over-quarter increase in salaries and benefits. Also impacting our second quarter overhead was incremental expense pertaining to incentive compensation programs across the majority of our reportable segments. This is due to our higher operating results to date as well as our revised profitability projections for full year 2023, which have necessitated our second upward revision in our annual earnings guidance. Tony will speak to our guidance range in detail later in this morning's presentation. Diluted earnings per common share was $2.95 as compared to $1.99 in the year ago quarter. Our second quarter performance establishes a new quarterly earnings per share record due to the combination of our strong net income our share repurchase activity, which has reduced our actual and weighted average shares outstanding. Please turn to slide 10. With the quarter commentary complete, I will touch on some highlights with respect to EMCOR's results for the first six months of 2023. Revenues of $5.94 billion represent an increase of $636.1 million or 12%, of which 10.6% was generated organically. Operating income of $351.6 million or 5.9% of revenues represents a 48% increase from the results of the first six months of 2022, as we have experienced improved operating income and operating margin in each of our domestic reporting segments. Our year-to-date diluted earnings per share was $5.28, which represents an approximate 57% increase over the $3.36 reported in 2022 as corresponding x-month period. With substantial growth in our net income, coupled with an almost 8% reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding due to our share repurchases throughout 2022 and 2023, we have been able to drive significant EPS growth on a year-to-date basis. My last comment on our results for the first half of 2023, and Tony commented specifically on the quarter, is that our operating cash flow of $214.9 million on a year-to-date basis represents a significant improvement over the cash used in operations of $18.9 million in 2022 six-month period. Despite our significant organic revenue growth and the resulting demands on working capital investment, our subsidiary management teams have done an excellent job of generating cash flow conversion, something we have been doing consistently over a long period of time. We are now on slide 11. EMCOR's balance sheet remains strong and liquid, and we continue to be in a position to invest in our business, return capital to shareholders and pursue strategic M&A investments. Fluctuations when compared to December of 2022 are as follows: Cash on hand was just over $503 million, which represents an increase of $46.6 million. Our exceptional operating cash flow was partially offset by cash used for financing activities of $126.4 million, inclusive of just over $105 million for the repurchase of our common stock. In addition, we've utilized $48.4 million for investing activities in the form of capital expenditures and acquisitions. Resulting primarily from our organic growth during the period, our working capital balance has increased by nearly $152 million. The $8.3 million increase in goodwill is entirely a result of the five acquisitions completed by us thus far in 2023, while net identified intangible assets have decreased by $19.5 million as the additional intangible assets recognized in connection with such acquisitions were more than offset by $32 million of amortization expense in the first half of the year. Total debt has remained substantially consistent our stockholders' equity balance has increased by $143.8 million as our net income for the period exceeded our share repurchases and dividend payments. As a result of our consistent debt balance, coupled with the increase in stockholders' equity, EMCOR's debt to capitalization ratio has reduced to 10.4% from 11.1% at year-end 2022. EMCOR was anticipating a strong 2023 after a record 2022, and our performance to date as well as revised expectations for full year 2023 are validating such expectations. With my portion of this morning's slide presentation complete, I will now return the call back to Tony. No, we're not. Yes, Sean. I think clearly, and not to rehash history, but quarter 1, from a seasonality perspective, tends to be one of our weakest quarters in the year, despite the fact that our Industrial Services segment is executing in the earlier periods of the spring turnaround season. I think when you look back to where we were exiting last year and certainly, where we were a year ago at this time, and Tony and I both have commented on this multiple times during the call, the revenue mix was good. It certainly wasn't bad, but we certainly had some projects in the mix that were marginal contributors or they were in loss positions. So I think the term of absence of badness that we've used many times in the past is certainly, relevant or germane to the 2023 periods. And that work other than one project is all cleaned up at this point. So that's a good thing from an activity perspective. The other thing, and we talked about supply chain many times, and we're certainly not saying that it's great, but it's certainly more normalized as we sit here in late July of 2023 than it certainly was at the midpoint of last year. So we're seeing flow of equipment from the OEMs, and that's giving us the ability to make sure we're utilizing our labor in the most efficient manner possible, which is driving better margins. And then specifically, I know I mentioned this in my prepared commentary, in the mechanical -- US Mechanical Construction segment, we did have some favorable project closeout. So back to the earlier caller's point, we only control the start and stop the projects based on our customer's project time line. To the extent that we execute in the fixed price environment or arena, on a better basis, then we obviously capture that improvement. And ultimately, we recognize it where it's appropriate. We certainly had that phenomenon in the second quarter. And as we look at the book of business, as we progress to the rest of 2023, we don't see any particular problematic areas other than the fact that we have thousands of active projects out there with, certainly, a very, very large deployed workforce that we need to make sure is executing at an exceptional level as we've demonstrated over a long period of time. So kind of a long-winded answer. Ultimately, the book of business is very, very strong. We're happy with the labor complement we have on the jobs. And the operating environment is still not optimal with regards to things that are outside of our control, but we've certainly seen some stabilization, which is giving us a little bit more positive momentum as we look at the outlook for the business."

I will cover pages four through six in my opening comments. The momentum in the past few quarters continued in our business as we had an exceptional first quarter 2023. Our team is executing well, and I appreciate the team's focus and dedication towards driving excellent outcomes for our customers. We earned diluted earnings per share of $2.32 on revenues of $2.89 billion and operating margin up 5.4%. We had strong first quarter organic revenue growth of 10.1% versus the year ago period. We also grew remaining performance obligations or RPOs from the year ago period and from December 31, 2022, to a record $7.87 billion. During the first quarter of 2023, we executed very well across all segments, and the broad themes that drove our business in 2022 continued, including the underlying strength in the retrofit markets with a focus on energy efficiency and IAQ, or Indoor Air Quality, which also leads to emissions reduction. Growth in the network communications and data center markets, strong demand in healthcare and high-tech manufacturing, including semiconductors and all things around the EV or electric vehicle value chain and traditional manufacturing and industrial projects driven by the onshoring supply chains and domestic capacity expansion. We also continue to see an increase in demand for our downstream refinery and petrochemical services. I will discuss these trends in more detail in my later commentary. Further, we are executing well on a good mix of business as evidenced by our improved gross profit margin of 15.1%. We still face headwinds from inflation and supply chain disruption, but we continue to improve our planning and execution to mitigate such headwinds which we expect to continue through the balance of 2023. As our results demonstrate, we had a great start to the year in our construction segments. This was due to the expertise and skill of our subsidiary and segment teams in estimating, winning, planning and executing complex projects across diverse market sectors, trades and geographies.  Our Mechanical Construction segment continues to perform in an exceptional manner with an operating income margin of 8% and organic revenue growth of 8.7%. Driving this growth is strong penetration in high-tech manufacturing, especially in the areas of semiconductors and the EV value chain as well as continued demand for data centers. We are winning in the traditional piping trades, but also our ever-expanding fire and life safety trades. Our strong operating income margin is a result of exceptional job site planning and execution supported by excellence in BIM and prefabrication. Our Electrical Construction segment's performance continue to strengthen to historic levels to historical levels. We earned an operating income margin of 6.3% in the quarter, representing a 250 basis point improvement versus a year ago period, and we had organic revenue growth of 16.8%. We had robust performance across important sectors such as network and communications, which encompasses our data center work, health care and manufacturing and industrial. We expect our results to continue to strengthen in the segment with improved project planning and execution, supported by the increased use of BIM or Building Information Modeling and prefabrication. Our recent acquisitions in this segment are performing well and have opened new markets and opportunities for us. Our US Building Services segment had a strong first quarter. We had operating margin of 5.2% with superior performance across the segment's Mechanical Services business as evidenced by organic growth, revenue growth, up 14.1%. We successfully executed project work and through improved planning, trade and job site coordination and estimating managed to address some of the supply chain challenges that negatively impacted such work last year. We often talk about the work we do to increase our customers' energy efficiency and improve air quality, which then results in emissions reductions and supports our customers' sustainability goals. Our building services companies work through a diverse set of channels to deliver these projects and services to commercial, institutional, health care and manufacturing customers. We serve these customers directly, but also through major real estate providers, utilities and ESCOs or energy service companies. We see our ability to serve our customers through such diverse channels as a competitive advantage, and we'll continue to seek out the broadest set of customers possible. The results of our Industrial Services segment continue to improve at a steady pace. Earning and operating margin up 4.5% in the first quarter of 2023. We executed a more normal turnaround season and saw improved demand and mix for our shop services. We continue to execute work supporting our customers' increased demand for energy and operating efficiency as well as the renewable fuel expansion. The segment's performance trajectory continues to improve, and we would be even more positive about this segment's outlook if solar panel supply chain issues were not delaying our execution of electrical work supporting these solar films. Our UK team continues to execute well despite a challenging market and foreign exchange headwinds. We continue to grow our customer base and are happy with our mix of facilities management contracts and owner-direct project work. We leave the quarter with an excellent mix of work in our record RPOs of $7.87 billion. We have a strong balance sheet to support our organic growth outlook and our capital allocation model. And with that, I will turn the presentation over to Mark.\nMark Pompa: Thank you, Tony, and good morning to everyone participating on the call today. For those accessing this presentation via the webcast, we are now on Slide 7. Over the next several slides, I will augment Tony's opening commentary and review each of our reportable segment's first quarter operating performance, as well as other chief financial data derived from our consolidated financial statements included in both our earnings release announcement and Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this morning. So let's expand our review of EMCOR's first quarter performance. Consolidated revenues of $2.89 billion are up $297.9 million or 11.5% over quarter one, 2022. Our first quarter results include $35.2 million of revenues attributable to businesses acquired, pertaining to the period of time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in last year's first quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, First quarter consolidated revenues increased approximately $262.7 million or 10.1% quarter-over-quarter. Before reviewing the operating results of our individual reporting segments, I would like to highlight that our consolidated revenues of $2.89 billion established a new first quarter record and represents our second best ever quarter. With that being said, I will now cover the results of each of our reportable segments, starting with revenue. United States Electrical Construction segment quarter one revenues of $644.7 million, increased $122.7 million or 23.5% in 2022's comparable quarter. Excluding incremental acquisition contribution, this segment's revenues grew a strong 16.8% organically quarter-over-quarter. Increased project activity within the network and communications, healthcare, manufacturing and hospitality and entertainment market sectors more than offset revenue declines in transportation and traditional commercial market sector activity. We continue to experience strong demand from our data center customers as evidenced by the growth in remaining performance obligations within the network and communications market sector, and we are executing against these contracts. Revenues of our United States Mechanical Construction segment of $1.1 billion increased approximately $86 million or 8.7% from the year ago period. Revenue growth during the quarter was predominantly derived from the high-tech and Network and Communications market sectors, increased activity within the quarter included both Mechanical Construction as well as fire protection services for customer projects, supporting the design and manufacture of semiconductors, electric vehicles and/or related battery technologies. Additionally, similar to our Electrical Construction segment, our Mechanical Construction businesses are experiencing strong demand resulting from the growth in data center development. Both our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segment established new first quarter revenue records in 2023 and consequently, our total US construction revenues of $1.72 billion, represent a first quarter record as well. This performance surpassed that of the prior year period by $208.6 million or 13.8%. United States Building Services segment revenues of $725.4 million increased $89.8 million or 14.1%, representing an all-time quarterly record for this segment. Growth was primarily experienced within the segment's Mechanical Services division, which generated incremental revenues from each of its service lines. Notably, we saw an increase in HVAC project and retrofit work, due to slightly improved equipment availability that facilitated greater project execution when compared to last year's first quarter, which was more severely impacted by the ongoing supply chain disruptions and delays. Additionally, this segment continues to experience strong demand for building automation and control solutions as our customers seek ways to improve the energy efficiency and/or indoor air quality of their facilities. With most companies focusing on their carbon footprint, we believe that this will be an area of continuing demand for us. Our United States Industrial Services segment generated revenues of $330.9 million, an increase of $20.1 million or 6.5% year-over-year. Despite the ongoing volatility in the broader oil and gas industry, we continue to see a steady resumption in demand for our field services offerings and as a result, we achieved a solid start to 2023. Additionally, we have experienced an increase in new build heat exchanger orders and pull-through cleaning and maintenance within this segment's shop services operations. United Kingdom Building Services segment revenues of $110.9 million represent a reduction of $20.6 million from last year's first quarter. Unfavorable exchange rate movements due to the weakening of the pound sterling negatively impacted this segment's quarter one 2023 revenues by $10.8 million. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, EMCOR's UK revenues decreased due to the loss of certain facilities maintenance contracts not renewed pursuant to rebuild, as well as a reduction in project activity with certain customers period-over-period. Please turn to slide eight. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $281.2 million, represent 9.7% of first quarter revenues and compared to $252.6 million and 9.7% of revenues in the year ago period. SG&A for the current year's quarter includes approximately $5.2 million of incremental expenses from businesses acquired, inclusive of intangible asset amortization, resulting in an organic increase in SG&A of $23.3 million. With EMCOR's continued revenue growth, we have added personnel to support our back office and contract administration functions, resulting in increases in salaries and benefits from the corresponding 2022 period. Additionally, with the increase in both our quarter one operating income and diluted earnings per share, as well as the positive revision in our full year 2023 EPS outlook, which Tony will cover later in this morning's presentation, we have seen a resulting increase in incentive compensation expense to reflect the actual and anticipated improvement in year-over-year performance. Reported operating income for the quarter was $154.9 million or 5.4% of revenues, it favorably compares to approximately $100 million of operating income or 3.9% of revenues a year ago. Consistent with my revenue commentary, the current quarter's operating income and operating margin performance each represent new quarter one records for the company. Specific quarterly operating income performance by segment is as follows. Our US Electrical Construction segment earned operating income of $40.5 million, an increase of $20.5 million from the comparable 2022 period. Reported operating margin of 6.3% is significantly improved from last year's quarter, given a more favorable revenue mix as well as the negative impact in 2022 of supply chain disruptions, which resulted in job site sequencing challenges, as well as reductions in labor productivity and efficiency. Although we are still experiencing various degrees of supply chain difficulties, the level of impact in the current year has been less severe than that experienced in the early part of 2022. This is due to both improved equipment availability and our subsidiary management team's ability to adapt to this less than optimal operating environment. First quarter operating income of our US Mechanical Construction segment of $86.2 million represents a $27.8 million increase from last year's quarter and operating margin of 8% represents a substantial increase from the 5.9% earned a year ago. In addition to this segment's exceptional project execution, a better revenue mix when compared to the first quarter of 2022, as well as moderate improvements in both supply chain and commodity pricing environments were the primary factors driving this quarter-over-quarter improvement. Operating income for US Building Services is $37.7 million or 5.2% of revenues and compares to $24.2 million or 3.8% of revenues in 2022's first quarter. Consistent with the segment's revenue performance, these improvements were driven by the Mechanical Services division, which saw increases in both gross profit and gross margin due to better project execution, as well as the favorable impact of negotiated price adjustments, which have been enacted in response to the inflationary pressures we've experienced. Compared to the year ago period, our US Industrial Services segment operating income of $15 million or 4.5% of revenues represents an increase of $1.8 million with a slight expansion in operating margin, better pricing and mix, coupled with more normalized demand are the primary reasons for these quarter-over-quarter improvements. UK Building Services operating income of $5.4 million represents a decrease of $5.2 million, while operating margin of 4.9% is reduced from 8.1% of margin a year ago. Exacerbating the impact of reduced quarterly revenues on operating income, this segment experienced a shift in the mix and size of project work, which resulted in a decrease in gross profit margin. Additionally, contributing to the unfavorable period-over-period comparison is the impact in 2022's first quarter of a successful project closeout, which enhanced reported operating margin in the prior year period. This segment's operating income was also negatively impacted in the quarter by $500,000 resulting from unfavorable exchange rate movements. We are now on slide nine. Additional financial items of significance for the quarter not addressed on the previous slides are as follows. Gross profit of $436.1 million is higher than the comparable prior year period, by $83.5 million or 23.7% and gross margin of 15.1% is up 150 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Diluted earnings per common share was $2.32 and as compared to $1.39 in 2022\u2019s first quarter. The increase in quarterly net income, combined with a reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding has led to a $0.93 EPS improvement year-over-year. Our share repurchases in 2022 have positively impacted our first quarter 2023 diluted earnings per share by $0.25. Please turn to slide 10. EMCOR's balance sheet maintains its strength in liquidity, positioning us to fund organic growth, pursue strategic M&A opportunities and return capital to shareholders. Fluctuation of note within our balance sheet, when compared to December of 2022, are as follows. Cash on hand of just over $420 million has decreased by $36.4 million. During the quarter, we utilized $84.6 million of cash to fund our operations, deployed $25.4 million for investing activities, including capital expenditures and acquisitions and returned $23.2 million to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends. These uses of cash were partially offset by borrowings during the period of $100 million under our revolving credit facility. Resulting primarily from our organic growth during the period, our working capital balance has increased by nearly $193 million. The slight increase in goodwill was entirely a result of the two asset acquisitions completed by us during quarter one of 2023, while identifiable intangible assets have decreased marginally as the assets recognized in connection with these acquisitions, were more than offset by amortization expense during the period. Total debt has increased by just under $100 million, as a result of the additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility previously referenced. This increase in debt is the primary reason for the change in our debt-to-capitalization ratio, reflected on the bottom of slide 10. And lastly, our stockholders' equity balance has increased by just over $92 million, as our net income for the period exceeded our share repurchases and dividend payments. With my portion of this morning's slide presentation completed, I will now return the call back to Tony. Tony?\nTony Guzzi: Yeah. Thanks, Mark, and I'm going to be on page 11, Remaining Performance Obligations, by segment and market. The robust demand for our services continued the trend we experienced in the final three quarters of 2022, into the first quarter of 2023. Total company Remaining Performance Obligations or RPOs at the end of the first quarter were almost $7.9 billion, up a little over $1.9 billion or 32% and over the March 2022 total of $5.95 billion, all but approximately $169 million of the $1.9 billion increase was organic. Additionally, first quarter project bookings were also strong with RPOs increasing $414 million or 5.5% in the first three months of 2023 from year-end 2022. With a 10.1% organic revenue growth, the continued RPO growth is a sign of strong underlying demand in our most resilient sectors. RPO growth was broad-based with each of our domestic reporting segments experiencing double-digit RPO growth in the first quarter versus the first quarter in the year ago period. Further, each of these four business segments saw RPOs increase in the first quarter from year-end 2022. Our two domestic construction segments experienced strong project growth year-over-year with combined RPOs increasing just under $1.7 billion or 36% from March 2022. The U.S. Mechanical Construction segment saw RPOs increased by $934 million or 28%. While the U.S. Electrical Construction segment saw an increase of $754 million or 58%. Much of the Construction segment's RPO increase results from continued demand for hyperscale data centers, semiconductor manufacturing and health care facilities. We are also engaged in the build-out of the Electric Vehicle or EV value chain, which includes the production and development of electric vehicles, battery plants and other manufacturing and industrial facilities driven to support this important new industry. We also are seeing increased demand from the on-shoring of manufacturing and industrial facilities as well as the expansion of capacities by some of our customers. Also across this whole EV value chain and across this reassuring and capacity expansion, we're seeing strong demand for our Fire and Life Safety services. Our U.S. Building Services RPO levels, increased $237 million or 23% from March 2022 and now stands at $1.25 billion, and a lot of that is a small to midsized project and service work. Like all of 2022, this quarter saw continued project awards in its Mechanical Services division which is focused a lot on energy efficiency, indoor air quality and general retrofit projects as well as repair service work which grows in all the channels we serve to deliver these projects. US Industrial Services grew RPO slightly year-over-year due to an increase in demand for our heat exchanger soft services and products.  Moving to the right side of the page, we show RPOs broken down by market sector. As you can see, we have expanded sector segmentation to 10 market sectors. As we stated in our February call and for greater transparency into our current and future work, we split out what was previously reported as commercial RPOs into three sectors. The first of which is at the bottom is the traditional commercial projects, and that's the golden bar. And it includes work in office buildings, warehouses, retail and restaurants and other commercial buildings. Commercial sector RPOs have increased $198 million or a little over 12% on a year-over-year basis. We disaggregated these commercial sectors into other ones to include network and communication. And that is the maroon bar. And that includes work that we previously referred to as our telecommunications projects, which are data centers, data and fiber projects and network cabling projects. This sector has grown RPOs and million or 86% year-over-year.  We now have a group called high-tech projects, and it's in the high-tech manufacturing sector, as shown by the green bar. And these projects and services are in the semiconductor biotech, life sciences, pharmaceutical and the EV value chain. Year-over-year, high-tech RPOs have increased $481 million or over 100%. We believe that these industries in this high-tech sector, high-tech manufacturing sectors are in for the most part in initial stages of capacity expansion and development. And that's what we -- we continue to expect to see growth, and it will be up and down a little bit as these are large projects a lot of times coming in, and that will drive growth in our RPOs. We also believe that to-date, there has been negligible impact of the government legislation that was designed to support these sectors. It just was passed, and we think that legislation will not only increase further demand, but we think it will elongate the duration of that demand. As I've said before, we continue to broaden our Fire & Life Safety services across all these sectors. That would be the gold, maroon and the green and we continue to provide projects across all sectors. Looking at other market sectors and year-over-year activity, healthcare RPOs are up 55%, institutional is up 10% and manufacturing and industrial up 35%; and short duration projects, which include much of the HVAC and repair service work, it's flat, maybe up 1%. And partially offsetting this increase was a reduction in transportation and water and wastewater RPOs. And looking at our market sector participation, it is noteworthy to see how balanced our participation is. This balance demonstrates one of the strengths we have highlighted before, which is our ability to provide electrical and mechanical construction, retrofit and repair service technical labor and solutions across diverse non-residential market sectors and US and UK geographies. We have decent work in hand and continue to bid new project opportunities across many non-residential market sectors. Our project mix is good, and we are executing well in all phases of project delivery in what is still a very challenging operating environment. I have mentioned several of these robust sectors before today that drive our growth. On the next page, on page 12, you'll see highlights and more depth that explain them to you. I am not going to cover that page in detail today because I think it would be redundant with the commentary I just made explaining our RPOs and with the enhanced disclosure around commercial, I think we've met many of the things we talk about on page 12. And with that, I will now turn to page 13 and 14. We expect our success to continue in 2023 despite a market that has uncertainty in it. we are going to leave our revenue guidance intact at $12 billion to $12.5 billion in revenues, but we are going to increase our earnings per diluted share guidance from what was a range of $8.75 to $9.50 to $9.25 to $10, and earnings per diluted share is what we now expect our guidance to be. Our RPOs remain strong, and we continue to see demand in key areas like we talked about, commercial remote semiconductors, health care, data centers, bio life sciences. We also are seeing strong demand, as I said before, for our fire life safety services across most major end markets. The supply chain issues and challenges that we experienced through the last still exists with long lead times, unreliable delivery schedule for finished systems like switchgear and HVAC equipment. We also expect to continue to see inflationary pressures for labor, materials and fuel. However, as we did in most of 2022 and in the first quarter of 2023, we will continue to adapt to better planning estimating and resource allocation. So where do we end up in this guidance range will depend on several factors, some in our control and some upside of our control. And I'm going to cover first the ones that we believe that are more in our control and it's not an exhaustive list, but it is the major ones. The first thing we need to do is we need to continue to increase our use of BIM or building information modeling prefabrication enhanced planning to drive efficiency, improve safety and increase the quality and productivity of our service delivery. We can need to continue to pay attention and enhance our pricing and estimating to mitigate the impact of inflation and supply chain challenges. Third, we need to leverage our reputation as an employer of choice to staff our jobs with the right mix of skills and classifications to not only enhance our labor productivity, but also our safety and cost. Fourth, we need to train and educate our employees at all levels of the organization to work smarter and lead better. Fifth, we need to be vigilant with our commercial service customers and actively monitor their financial condition and payment status with us as they remain challenged with occupancy and now refinancing issues. And finally, we always look to gain SG&A leverage. However, we always will have areas beyond our control that could affect our performance. Number one, material sourcing and lead times continue to challenge the market and our customers. I don't think that's improving in 2023, not much anyway. Number two, higher interest rates and economic uncertainty may impact the demand for some of our customers' products and services, and then it will impact us. I expect this will move some projects in the planning stage to later periods, and those in the decision stage may be postponed, rephased or rescoped. Number three, disruption caused by uncertain energy markets and supply, especially as the conflict in Ukraine continues and it could potentially intensify. OPEC took supply out of the market and China is reopening increases demand. However, we expect to continue to generate strong operating cash flow, and we'll continue to execute our long-term and successful capital allocation strategy that balances supporting our organic growth and acquisition, while returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Finally, as always, I would like to continue to thank the EMCOR team because none of this would be possible without your discipline, teamwork and dedication to drive the best possible results for our customers. And as a result of serving our customers so well, we continue to produce outstanding results for our shareholders. And with that, Keith, I will take questions\nOperator: Thank you. At this time I will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson.\nBrent Thielman : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Congrats on a great quarter.\nTony Guzzi : Good morning, Brent. Thank you.\nBrent Thielman : Tony, I was just wondering if you could comment on your traditional commercial verticals just in the context of these kind of heightened concerns around credit tightening. It seems like that would be an area you may have the most exposure risk. But I'd love to hear sort of how you'd pick that apart are there high levels of retrofit and upgrades within that vertical versus new construction? Any anecdotes there would be really helpful.\nTony Guzzi : I mean so that's why we did the enhanced disclosure. Then you can see the yellow bars traditional commercial. And it's the part that's up leased year-over-year, and it's essentially flat from year-end. Now part of that is a result of we're starting to burn through. That's where you really saw the impact of elongated supply lines because those projects that we do, for the most part, are meant to be quicker hitting. So if you think about EMCOR's commercial backlog, probably less than 1% of what we do today to 1.5% is what I would call new out-of-the-ground commercial or high-rise residential. At one time, that was very different. The bulk of the business that's in that traditional yellow section or even that pink section, probably that pink section has you could take that pink section and spread it across all our other sectors there, the short duration projects, but that yellow for the most part, is aftermarket. It's short duration projects. It\u2019s not short duration. It's major retrofit. It's retrofit. It's tenant build-out. It's ad moves and changes. It's where our longer duration energy retrofit projects are. It's that kind of stuff is the fast provider of what we do in commercial now. And then as you move up, right, we talked about the maroon and the green, I mean, the reality is that's a good breakout, right, because that's where the growth is coming for us. And like we said, that growth was coming even before the enhanced legislation. I'd like the CHIPS Act and IRA, we expect that to even continue more and I talked about it maybe growth or elongation. But we're careful in that commercial sector. We've been careful in that commercial sector for a long time. We're especially careful when it's developer-led. We pay attention to a lot of collections, and we pay attention to their financing. Do I think new grow commercial is a growth market right now? No. Do I think there's opportunities with well-capitalized customers? The answer is yes. Do I think the energy efficiency market has legs for a lot to go? And I like the way we service that energy efficiency market and the short duration project market. We service that through a lot of different channels. We go direct to the owner. We go to the owners what would be called their in-house general contractor or construction manager that may run all their projects like in a university or a manufacturing setting, but we're the contractor of choice and have been there for a while. We go through the large real estate providers and facilities managers. We go through that channel. We go through utilities that have programs where they help fund and direct and they have the salespeople that work with us to sell the project. And then we go through the major ESCOs where they may sell projects and now they actually have people actually have to go figure out how to get it done. And we have the sales force that knows how to sell to them and sell every one of those channels. And so we like that position. We think that market has legs. So it's a complex answer, but that's why we did the enhanced disclosure because we were thinking -- we were starting to make it harder for us to have people understand where the real growth and what that commercial sector the way we traditionally defined it was.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. I appreciate that. Just I guess staying on the topic of the RPOs, Tony, the healthcare piece also really sticks out to me just the continued expansion there. I guess my question is, would you consider that a fairly diverse group of customers and a broader trend, or is this aligned with some specific customers that just happen to be spending?\nTony Guzzi: It's both, Brent. It's both, right? $0.01 specific customers drive that backlog because they can be large projects. But if you look over a two or three year period, over time and the way we think about it is part of a broader trend. They got, quite frankly, disrupted a little bit with COVID because they weren't building new facilities in the middle of COVID. They were building emergency facilities been on new facilities or retrofitting so you can do multiuse. So some of this is pent-up demand or what should have been capital planning, but it's a long-term trend. Hospitals and big healthcare facilities and out paid facilities, they need to be cleaner. They need to have better ventilation they need to have an ability to flex from positive pressure to negative pressure in our world. They have much more complex low-voltage needs. They have much more complex general electrical needs they have to put backup power. And while they're doing all that, they have to think about their sustainability goals and how they're going to operate that facility more efficiently.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. Thanks, Tony. And the last one, just, I guess, which of the two construction business groups? Are you seeing still sort of more profound challenges related to the supply disruptions in -- is it more electrical or mechanical because it looks like the electrical margin definitely snap back big from last year, but maybe a little below levels we've seen in the past. I'd just love to kind of understand that.\nTony Guzzi: I think I would say probably electrical more than mechanical, it's a more consolidated market for major end products, and it's more on the critical path. So we've had to rejigger our means and methods to work around that. Mechanically, we buy a lot of equipment, we do a lot of HVAC work. We also do a lot of district piping work supporting big process plants or where the owner bought the equipment. And so they do that in the electrical business, too, for major gear. But my experience has been when you look at things like generators and switchgears and smart panels, the delivery performance is not great yet. The mechanical has gotten a little better, at least what they say they're going to do, they do. But the electrical lead times haven't really moved much down at all. The mechanicals have started to move down a little bit. And I think, in general, the mechanical sales forces are more in tune with their factories. And I think they have better visibility to keep us up to date on what's happening than the electrical sales force.\nBrent Thielman: It's really helpful. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Thanks guys.\nTony Guzzi: Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson, Davis.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey, good morning, guys. Great quarter.\nTony Guzzi: Thanks, Adam.\nAdam Thalhimer: On the industrial business, that was your best quarterly op income in three years. Just curious, what your visibility is like there and what the -- if you can build on the Q1 results.\nTony Guzzi: Look, we think things have gotten better. We like where our shop backlog is at. We like what that portends for the future. We think we're in a more normalized operating environment, which is good. We expect to continue to operate normally. We have no reason to believe we don't have a normal fall turnaround season coming up. I think the long pull in the 10 is a new product we have, right, or a new service, which is building these alternative energy, the renewables, especially around solar, and that's clogged up everywhere. But Mark, I mean\u2026\nMark Pompa: Yes, Adam, the only thing I would add is just don't lose sight of the fact of the seasonality of that business. So it's kind of bookends quarter one and quarter four. But having said that, we saw, as Tony mentioned a couple of times during his pre-prepared remarks, we saw us close to a normal operating environment as we've seen in a while with that customer base. And it's -- a lot of it is mix driven as well. So we're deploying the qualified label we have. And if our customers adhere to their -- to the schedules that we've been planning with them, we're optimistic that 2023 is going to at least look like a normal 12-month performance period for the Industrial Services segment.\nTony Guzzi: And that's reflected in our guidance. And part of that is reflected in our guidance takeup.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. What is the outlook for solar panels? I don't I have followed that closely.\nTony Guzzi: There are certainly people way better qualified to talk about that than us as part of our business. But based on what we see, not good. It's still plugged up. I don't think there's going to be this big uptick this year. But again, that's sort of -- there's people who know a lot more about that to me, as someone that's followed it closely through our bidding and work, we see a lot of delayed work.\nAdam Thalhimer: Yes. And then I guess, Blake kind of touched on this, but I just wanted to touch on your macro comment. And I guess the debate is, where do you think macro would manifest itself? Because it seems like a lot of these big projects are kind of locked and loaded and there's government support -- so maybe those big projects go, but there's risk to the short duration projects?\nTony Guzzi: Yes. I think there's \u2013 it's hard to tell. I mean the short duration projects have something that's been driving them for a while. And so there's this counterbalancing view out there, right, in my mind because of energy pricing. And people who drive for more sustainable facilities. So on one hand, you sit there and say, I just won't do the project. On the other hand, you say, every day, I don't do that project, my cost structure becomes worse because energy prices continue to become uncertain and escalate. And most of our major customers have committed to sustainability goals. And you can't get there unless you do equipment replacement and modernization and all -- something as simple as fixing the compressor lines in a manufacturing facility. That requires a lot of work. It requires new equipment. If you take out something that used to be 0.68 kw per tonne, and now you're putting in something with 0.32kw per tonne on a chiller, and it has variable speed -- that's a market change in your operating cost profile. And then you're going to start thinking about, okay, I have to do that. If I don't do that in these triple net leases, which has always been the vein to the existence of energy efficiency, my building may no longer be competitive, right? So I have all these forces going on around me. And so I think that if you're heavily exposed to new build commercial, you probably have a different outlook than we have on that. I also think, if you think of some of these major projects that are going on, on those big things I talked about from reshoring, EV, value chain, semiconductors, data centers. And remember, there's a whole ecosystem around each of those. I guess most of this was happening without government support. That can only help it now, and it can only elongate it in my mind. And most of these customers are not worried about a 500 basis point expansion in interest rate costs. One, they're self-funded for the most part and the kind of value they're going to create over what they're doing. And then you layer on top of that for some of these industries, the demand with respect to national security and the onshoring of some critical industries, I think that mix drives long-term demand in a favorable way. And look, for us, we have great RPOs. We expect to continue to have great RPOs. From this high level, that could plus or minus a little bit quarter-to-quarter, but we expect our overall trends over the next couple of years to be pretty good as -- in these major sectors, but we'll see.\nAdam Thalhimer: Exactly. Good color. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc.\nSean Eastman: Hi, team. Great start here. Very good start. I thought -- I mean, I thought the big takeaway from the first quarter was really the margins. I mean, I think this is a record margin performance for our first quarter. Yet you guys are saying, there's still kind of lingering supply chain challenges. Is there something unsustainable that came through in the first quarter or are we just kind of effectively not updating the outlook sort of just flowing through a better start to the year?\nTony Guzzi: I don't know, Sean. I think taking our outlook up to $9.25 to $10 from $8.75 to $9.50, a pretty big move. I think the revenue velocities in the businesses, and we said that in our initial guidance, and I think further, if you extrapolate that, I think that what we're really saying in the guidance is we expect strong margins through the year. Now, we are mix dependent and projects start, they finish. But we -- there was nothing extraordinary in the first quarter, right, Mark?\nMark Pompa: Sean, the only thing I'd point out, if you recollect from quarter one last year, we did have some additional headwinds with regards to project write-downs, both in electrical and mechanical construction. The extent of write-down activity in the first quarter of 2023 was not at that same level. The other thing, which is extremely difficult to quantify relative to 2023\u2019s quarter one, is with the fairly mild winter weather pattern we had in most of the geographies we operate, we didn't deal with the same level of job site difficulties with regards to finding weather. But like I said, that's difficult to quantify. It does not have an outsized impact on the quarter performance. And the only thing I might have done is pulled some activity forward in the year.\nTony Guzzi: And I think the other thing that bolstered first quarter operating margins -- operating income margins is, this is a seasonally strong quarter for industrial. And so we have to factor in with second and third quarter mean to us there, especially if we can't deliver some of the solar work that we hope to deliver towards the back half of the year. So, -- and then I guess just general caution, right? I mean I talked about the things we don't control. And those are sizable macro forces we don't control. And so we think it's prudent to have an eye towards that. But I think we have a strong guidance out there to update us. We started the year with strong guidance. We updated that with strong guidance. And underlying that is what we believe, depending on where you are in that revenue range is pretty strong underlying operating performance.\nSean Eastman: Yes. Look, I don't want to take the wind out of the sales, great update. I guess what I was getting at is just that I have to go back to 2014 to find a year where the first quarter is not the low watermark operating margin for the year. And I feel like with that dynamic in mind, it seems like there's a lot of cushion in the guidance from a margin perspective over the balance of the year?\nTony Guzzi: Yes, I mean we had a lot of -- I mean, when we start looking at this at the macro level though, right? There's a lot of puts and takes in any given quarter. And we think that with those countervailing macro forces and how they could impact the back of the year, we think that we put strong guidance out and we think we'll obviously end up somewhere in that range. And we got to execute well on the things that we can to keep those margins where they are and I went neater four or five points that we think are most important.\nSean Eastman: And coming back to the credit tightening element being so topical, maybe approaching that from a different way. How do you see that potentially impacting your M&A pipeline?\nTony Guzzi: I don't think it impacts our ability to do what we think we need to execute other things we would like to execute. I think though, Sean, we know this, right, if the overall M&A environment is not favorable, less things may be for sale, right? Now, a lot of the things we buy are necessarily in that typical M&A market. most of the deals we've done over the last three years have been people selling their life's work, which is where we operate the best, right? That's where we are the most successful, and we also drive the most value, not only for the person selling the business because they have a lot of things we're looking at, but for our shareholders, and it gives us new opportunities to grow. But look, private equity is not much in the market right now between interest rates, covenants and credit tightening and the ability to place their secondary debt. They're not in the market, people that want a robust auction around the process, therefore, are trying to sell their companies right now. And so put all that together, it's no secret. I mean, you follow the same things we do. M&A volumes are down significantly. That being said, for the kinds of things we do, I don't think it -- I would say, oh, my god, it's the most robust pipeline I've ever seen. But what we have was, I think, is an acceptable pipeline of opportunities for us to pursue to continue to build on our footprint, add to our capability, and enhance the services we're offering across a number of geographies or new geographies or product lines would like to add a product services would like that.\nSean Eastman: Got it. Got it. All right. Thanks for the perspective. Many compliments to the team.\nTony Guzzi: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to return the call to Tony Guzzi for any closing comments.\nTony Guzzi: Thank you very much all. We started well in 2023. We got a lot of work ahead of us. And I hope you all are well. Have a good summer and be safe.\nOperator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Mark Pompa",
            "content": "Thank you, Tony, and good morning to everyone participating on the call today. For those accessing this presentation via the webcast, we are now on Slide 7. Over the next several slides, I will augment Tony's opening commentary and review each of our reportable segment's first quarter operating performance, as well as other chief financial data derived from our consolidated financial statements included in both our earnings release announcement and Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this morning. So let's expand our review of EMCOR's first quarter performance. Consolidated revenues of $2.89 billion are up $297.9 million or 11.5% over quarter one, 2022. Our first quarter results include $35.2 million of revenues attributable to businesses acquired, pertaining to the period of time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in last year's first quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, First quarter consolidated revenues increased approximately $262.7 million or 10.1% quarter-over-quarter. Before reviewing the operating results of our individual reporting segments, I would like to highlight that our consolidated revenues of $2.89 billion established a new first quarter record and represents our second best ever quarter. With that being said, I will now cover the results of each of our reportable segments, starting with revenue. United States Electrical Construction segment quarter one revenues of $644.7 million, increased $122.7 million or 23.5% in 2022's comparable quarter. Excluding incremental acquisition contribution, this segment's revenues grew a strong 16.8% organically quarter-over-quarter. Increased project activity within the network and communications, healthcare, manufacturing and hospitality and entertainment market sectors more than offset revenue declines in transportation and traditional commercial market sector activity. We continue to experience strong demand from our data center customers as evidenced by the growth in remaining performance obligations within the network and communications market sector, and we are executing against these contracts. Revenues of our United States Mechanical Construction segment of $1.1 billion increased approximately $86 million or 8.7% from the year ago period. Revenue growth during the quarter was predominantly derived from the high-tech and Network and Communications market sectors, increased activity within the quarter included both Mechanical Construction as well as fire protection services for customer projects, supporting the design and manufacture of semiconductors, electric vehicles and/or related battery technologies. Additionally, similar to our Electrical Construction segment, our Mechanical Construction businesses are experiencing strong demand resulting from the growth in data center development. Both our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segment established new first quarter revenue records in 2023 and consequently, our total US construction revenues of $1.72 billion, represent a first quarter record as well. This performance surpassed that of the prior year period by $208.6 million or 13.8%. United States Building Services segment revenues of $725.4 million increased $89.8 million or 14.1%, representing an all-time quarterly record for this segment. Growth was primarily experienced within the segment's Mechanical Services division, which generated incremental revenues from each of its service lines. Notably, we saw an increase in HVAC project and retrofit work, due to slightly improved equipment availability that facilitated greater project execution when compared to last year's first quarter, which was more severely impacted by the ongoing supply chain disruptions and delays. Additionally, this segment continues to experience strong demand for building automation and control solutions as our customers seek ways to improve the energy efficiency and/or indoor air quality of their facilities. With most companies focusing on their carbon footprint, we believe that this will be an area of continuing demand for us. Our United States Industrial Services segment generated revenues of $330.9 million, an increase of $20.1 million or 6.5% year-over-year. Despite the ongoing volatility in the broader oil and gas industry, we continue to see a steady resumption in demand for our field services offerings and as a result, we achieved a solid start to 2023. Additionally, we have experienced an increase in new build heat exchanger orders and pull-through cleaning and maintenance within this segment's shop services operations. United Kingdom Building Services segment revenues of $110.9 million represent a reduction of $20.6 million from last year's first quarter. Unfavorable exchange rate movements due to the weakening of the pound sterling negatively impacted this segment's quarter one 2023 revenues by $10.8 million. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, EMCOR's UK revenues decreased due to the loss of certain facilities maintenance contracts not renewed pursuant to rebuild, as well as a reduction in project activity with certain customers period-over-period. Please turn to slide eight. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $281.2 million, represent 9.7% of first quarter revenues and compared to $252.6 million and 9.7% of revenues in the year ago period. SG&A for the current year's quarter includes approximately $5.2 million of incremental expenses from businesses acquired, inclusive of intangible asset amortization, resulting in an organic increase in SG&A of $23.3 million. With EMCOR's continued revenue growth, we have added personnel to support our back office and contract administration functions, resulting in increases in salaries and benefits from the corresponding 2022 period. Additionally, with the increase in both our quarter one operating income and diluted earnings per share, as well as the positive revision in our full year 2023 EPS outlook, which Tony will cover later in this morning's presentation, we have seen a resulting increase in incentive compensation expense to reflect the actual and anticipated improvement in year-over-year performance. Reported operating income for the quarter was $154.9 million or 5.4% of revenues, it favorably compares to approximately $100 million of operating income or 3.9% of revenues a year ago. Consistent with my revenue commentary, the current quarter's operating income and operating margin performance each represent new quarter one records for the company. Specific quarterly operating income performance by segment is as follows. Our US Electrical Construction segment earned operating income of $40.5 million, an increase of $20.5 million from the comparable 2022 period. Reported operating margin of 6.3% is significantly improved from last year's quarter, given a more favorable revenue mix as well as the negative impact in 2022 of supply chain disruptions, which resulted in job site sequencing challenges, as well as reductions in labor productivity and efficiency. Although we are still experiencing various degrees of supply chain difficulties, the level of impact in the current year has been less severe than that experienced in the early part of 2022. This is due to both improved equipment availability and our subsidiary management team's ability to adapt to this less than optimal operating environment. First quarter operating income of our US Mechanical Construction segment of $86.2 million represents a $27.8 million increase from last year's quarter and operating margin of 8% represents a substantial increase from the 5.9% earned a year ago. In addition to this segment's exceptional project execution, a better revenue mix when compared to the first quarter of 2022, as well as moderate improvements in both supply chain and commodity pricing environments were the primary factors driving this quarter-over-quarter improvement. Operating income for US Building Services is $37.7 million or 5.2% of revenues and compares to $24.2 million or 3.8% of revenues in 2022's first quarter. Consistent with the segment's revenue performance, these improvements were driven by the Mechanical Services division, which saw increases in both gross profit and gross margin due to better project execution, as well as the favorable impact of negotiated price adjustments, which have been enacted in response to the inflationary pressures we've experienced. Compared to the year ago period, our US Industrial Services segment operating income of $15 million or 4.5% of revenues represents an increase of $1.8 million with a slight expansion in operating margin, better pricing and mix, coupled with more normalized demand are the primary reasons for these quarter-over-quarter improvements. UK Building Services operating income of $5.4 million represents a decrease of $5.2 million, while operating margin of 4.9% is reduced from 8.1% of margin a year ago. Exacerbating the impact of reduced quarterly revenues on operating income, this segment experienced a shift in the mix and size of project work, which resulted in a decrease in gross profit margin. Additionally, contributing to the unfavorable period-over-period comparison is the impact in 2022's first quarter of a successful project closeout, which enhanced reported operating margin in the prior year period. This segment's operating income was also negatively impacted in the quarter by $500,000 resulting from unfavorable exchange rate movements. We are now on slide nine. Additional financial items of significance for the quarter not addressed on the previous slides are as follows. Gross profit of $436.1 million is higher than the comparable prior year period, by $83.5 million or 23.7% and gross margin of 15.1% is up 150 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Diluted earnings per common share was $2.32 and as compared to $1.39 in 2022's first quarter. The increase in quarterly net income, combined with a reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding has led to a $0.93 EPS improvement year-over-year. Our share repurchases in 2022 have positively impacted our first quarter 2023 diluted earnings per share by $0.25. Please turn to slide 10. EMCOR's balance sheet maintains its strength in liquidity, positioning us to fund organic growth, pursue strategic M&A opportunities and return capital to shareholders. Fluctuation of note within our balance sheet, when compared to December of 2022, are as follows. Cash on hand of just over $420 million has decreased by $36.4 million. During the quarter, we utilized $84.6 million of cash to fund our operations, deployed $25.4 million for investing activities, including capital expenditures and acquisitions and returned $23.2 million to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends. These uses of cash were partially offset by borrowings during the period of $100 million under our revolving credit facility. Resulting primarily from our organic growth during the period, our working capital balance has increased by nearly $193 million. The slight increase in goodwill was entirely a result of the two asset acquisitions completed by us during quarter one of 2023, while identifiable intangible assets have decreased marginally as the assets recognized in connection with these acquisitions, were more than offset by amortization expense during the period. Total debt has increased by just under $100 million, as a result of the additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility previously referenced. This increase in debt is the primary reason for the change in our debt-to-capitalization ratio, reflected on the bottom of slide 10. And lastly, our stockholders' equity balance has increased by just over $92 million, as our net income for the period exceeded our share repurchases and dividend payments. With my portion of this morning's slide presentation completed, I will now return the call back to Tony. Tony? Yes, Adam, the only thing I would add is just don't lose sight of the fact of the seasonality of that business. So it's kind of bookends quarter one and quarter four. But having said that, we saw, as Tony mentioned a couple of times during his pre-prepared remarks, we saw us close to a normal operating environment as we've seen in a while with that customer base. And it's -- a lot of it is mix driven as well. So we're deploying the qualified label we have. And if our customers adhere to their -- to the schedules that we've been planning with them, we're optimistic that 2023 is going to at least look like a normal 12-month performance period for the Industrial Services segment. Sean, the only thing I'd point out, if you recollect from quarter one last year, we did have some additional headwinds with regards to project write-downs, both in electrical and mechanical construction. The extent of write-down activity in the first quarter of 2023 was not at that same level. The other thing, which is extremely difficult to quantify relative to 2023's quarter one, is with the fairly mild winter weather pattern we had in most of the geographies we operate, we didn't deal with the same level of job site difficulties with regards to finding weather. But like I said, that's difficult to quantify. It does not have an outsized impact on the quarter performance. And the only thing I might have done is pulled some activity forward in the year."

            "name": "Tony Guzzi",
            "content": "Yeah. Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, and thank you for joining our call. I will cover pages four through six in my opening comments. The momentum in the past few quarters continued in our business as we had an exceptional first quarter 2023. Our team is executing well, and I appreciate the team's focus and dedication towards driving excellent outcomes for our customers. We earned diluted earnings per share of $2.32 on revenues of $2.89 billion and operating margin up 5.4%. We had strong first quarter organic revenue growth of 10.1% versus the year ago period. We also grew remaining performance obligations or RPOs from the year ago period and from December 31, 2022, to a record $7.87 billion. During the first quarter of 2023, we executed very well across all segments, and the broad themes that drove our business in 2022 continued, including the underlying strength in the retrofit markets with a focus on energy efficiency and IAQ, or Indoor Air Quality, which also leads to emissions reduction. Growth in the network communications and data center markets, strong demand in healthcare and high-tech manufacturing, including semiconductors and all things around the EV or electric vehicle value chain and traditional manufacturing and industrial projects driven by the onshoring supply chains and domestic capacity expansion. We also continue to see an increase in demand for our downstream refinery and petrochemical services. I will discuss these trends in more detail in my later commentary. Further, we are executing well on a good mix of business as evidenced by our improved gross profit margin of 15.1%. We still face headwinds from inflation and supply chain disruption, but we continue to improve our planning and execution to mitigate such headwinds which we expect to continue through the balance of 2023. As our results demonstrate, we had a great start to the year in our construction segments. This was due to the expertise and skill of our subsidiary and segment teams in estimating, winning, planning and executing complex projects across diverse market sectors, trades and geographies.  Our Mechanical Construction segment continues to perform in an exceptional manner with an operating income margin of 8% and organic revenue growth of 8.7%. Driving this growth is strong penetration in high-tech manufacturing, especially in the areas of semiconductors and the EV value chain as well as continued demand for data centers. We are winning in the traditional piping trades, but also our ever-expanding fire and life safety trades. Our strong operating income margin is a result of exceptional job site planning and execution supported by excellence in BIM and prefabrication. Our Electrical Construction segment's performance continue to strengthen to historic levels to historical levels. We earned an operating income margin of 6.3% in the quarter, representing a 250 basis point improvement versus a year ago period, and we had organic revenue growth of 16.8%. We had robust performance across important sectors such as network and communications, which encompasses our data center work, health care and manufacturing and industrial. We expect our results to continue to strengthen in the segment with improved project planning and execution, supported by the increased use of BIM or Building Information Modeling and prefabrication. Our recent acquisitions in this segment are performing well and have opened new markets and opportunities for us. Our US Building Services segment had a strong first quarter. We had operating margin of 5.2% with superior performance across the segment's Mechanical Services business as evidenced by organic growth, revenue growth, up 14.1%. We successfully executed project work and through improved planning, trade and job site coordination and estimating managed to address some of the supply chain challenges that negatively impacted such work last year. We often talk about the work we do to increase our customers' energy efficiency and improve air quality, which then results in emissions reductions and supports our customers' sustainability goals. Our building services companies work through a diverse set of channels to deliver these projects and services to commercial, institutional, health care and manufacturing customers. We serve these customers directly, but also through major real estate providers, utilities and ESCOs or energy service companies. We see our ability to serve our customers through such diverse channels as a competitive advantage, and we'll continue to seek out the broadest set of customers possible. The results of our Industrial Services segment continue to improve at a steady pace. Earning and operating margin up 4.5% in the first quarter of 2023. We executed a more normal turnaround season and saw improved demand and mix for our shop services. We continue to execute work supporting our customers' increased demand for energy and operating efficiency as well as the renewable fuel expansion. The segment's performance trajectory continues to improve, and we would be even more positive about this segment's outlook if solar panel supply chain issues were not delaying our execution of electrical work supporting these solar films. Our UK team continues to execute well despite a challenging market and foreign exchange headwinds. We continue to grow our customer base and are happy with our mix of facilities management contracts and owner-direct project work. We leave the quarter with an excellent mix of work in our record RPOs of $7.87 billion. We have a strong balance sheet to support our organic growth outlook and our capital allocation model. And with that, I will turn the presentation over to Mark. Yeah. Thanks, Mark, and I'm going to be on page 11, Remaining Performance Obligations, by segment and market. The robust demand for our services continued the trend we experienced in the final three quarters of 2022, into the first quarter of 2023. Total company Remaining Performance Obligations or RPOs at the end of the first quarter were almost $7.9 billion, up a little over $1.9 billion or 32% and over the March 2022 total of $5.95 billion, all but approximately $169 million of the $1.9 billion increase was organic. Additionally, first quarter project bookings were also strong with RPOs increasing $414 million or 5.5% in the first three months of 2023 from year-end 2022. With a 10.1% organic revenue growth, the continued RPO growth is a sign of strong underlying demand in our most resilient sectors. RPO growth was broad-based with each of our domestic reporting segments experiencing double-digit RPO growth in the first quarter versus the first quarter in the year ago period. Further, each of these four business segments saw RPOs increase in the first quarter from year-end 2022. Our two domestic construction segments experienced strong project growth year-over-year with combined RPOs increasing just under $1.7 billion or 36% from March 2022. The U.S. Mechanical Construction segment saw RPOs increased by $934 million or 28%. While the U.S. Electrical Construction segment saw an increase of $754 million or 58%. Much of the Construction segment's RPO increase results from continued demand for hyperscale data centers, semiconductor manufacturing and health care facilities. We are also engaged in the build-out of the Electric Vehicle or EV value chain, which includes the production and development of electric vehicles, battery plants and other manufacturing and industrial facilities driven to support this important new industry. We also are seeing increased demand from the on-shoring of manufacturing and industrial facilities as well as the expansion of capacities by some of our customers. Also across this whole EV value chain and across this reassuring and capacity expansion, we're seeing strong demand for our Fire and Life Safety services. Our U.S. Building Services RPO levels, increased $237 million or 23% from March 2022 and now stands at $1.25 billion, and a lot of that is a small to midsized project and service work. Like all of 2022, this quarter saw continued project awards in its Mechanical Services division which is focused a lot on energy efficiency, indoor air quality and general retrofit projects as well as repair service work which grows in all the channels we serve to deliver these projects. US Industrial Services grew RPO slightly year-over-year due to an increase in demand for our heat exchanger soft services and products.  Moving to the right side of the page, we show RPOs broken down by market sector. As you can see, we have expanded sector segmentation to 10 market sectors. As we stated in our February call and for greater transparency into our current and future work, we split out what was previously reported as commercial RPOs into three sectors. The first of which is at the bottom is the traditional commercial projects, and that's the golden bar. And it includes work in office buildings, warehouses, retail and restaurants and other commercial buildings. Commercial sector RPOs have increased $198 million or a little over 12% on a year-over-year basis. We disaggregated these commercial sectors into other ones to include network and communication. And that is the maroon bar. And that includes work that we previously referred to as our telecommunications projects, which are data centers, data and fiber projects and network cabling projects. This sector has grown RPOs and million or 86% year-over-year.  We now have a group called high-tech projects, and it's in the high-tech manufacturing sector, as shown by the green bar. And these projects and services are in the semiconductor biotech, life sciences, pharmaceutical and the EV value chain. Year-over-year, high-tech RPOs have increased $481 million or over 100%. We believe that these industries in this high-tech sector, high-tech manufacturing sectors are in for the most part in initial stages of capacity expansion and development. And that's what we -- we continue to expect to see growth, and it will be up and down a little bit as these are large projects a lot of times coming in, and that will drive growth in our RPOs. We also believe that to-date, there has been negligible impact of the government legislation that was designed to support these sectors. It just was passed, and we think that legislation will not only increase further demand, but we think it will elongate the duration of that demand. As I've said before, we continue to broaden our Fire & Life Safety services across all these sectors. That would be the gold, maroon and the green and we continue to provide projects across all sectors. Looking at other market sectors and year-over-year activity, healthcare RPOs are up 55%, institutional is up 10% and manufacturing and industrial up 35%; and short duration projects, which include much of the HVAC and repair service work, it's flat, maybe up 1%. And partially offsetting this increase was a reduction in transportation and water and wastewater RPOs. And looking at our market sector participation, it is noteworthy to see how balanced our participation is. This balance demonstrates one of the strengths we have highlighted before, which is our ability to provide electrical and mechanical construction, retrofit and repair service technical labor and solutions across diverse non-residential market sectors and US and UK geographies. We have decent work in hand and continue to bid new project opportunities across many non-residential market sectors. Our project mix is good, and we are executing well in all phases of project delivery in what is still a very challenging operating environment. I have mentioned several of these robust sectors before today that drive our growth. On the next page, on page 12, you'll see highlights and more depth that explain them to you. I am not going to cover that page in detail today because I think it would be redundant with the commentary I just made explaining our RPOs and with the enhanced disclosure around commercial, I think we've met many of the things we talk about on page 12. And with that, I will now turn to page 13 and 14. We expect our success to continue in 2023 despite a market that has uncertainty in it. we are going to leave our revenue guidance intact at $12 billion to $12.5 billion in revenues, but we are going to increase our earnings per diluted share guidance from what was a range of $8.75 to $9.50 to $9.25 to $10, and earnings per diluted share is what we now expect our guidance to be. Our RPOs remain strong, and we continue to see demand in key areas like we talked about, commercial remote semiconductors, health care, data centers, bio life sciences. We also are seeing strong demand, as I said before, for our fire life safety services across most major end markets. The supply chain issues and challenges that we experienced through the last still exists with long lead times, unreliable delivery schedule for finished systems like switchgear and HVAC equipment. We also expect to continue to see inflationary pressures for labor, materials and fuel. However, as we did in most of 2022 and in the first quarter of 2023, we will continue to adapt to better planning estimating and resource allocation. So where do we end up in this guidance range will depend on several factors, some in our control and some upside of our control. And I'm going to cover first the ones that we believe that are more in our control and it's not an exhaustive list, but it is the major ones. The first thing we need to do is we need to continue to increase our use of BIM or building information modeling prefabrication enhanced planning to drive efficiency, improve safety and increase the quality and productivity of our service delivery. We can need to continue to pay attention and enhance our pricing and estimating to mitigate the impact of inflation and supply chain challenges. Third, we need to leverage our reputation as an employer of choice to staff our jobs with the right mix of skills and classifications to not only enhance our labor productivity, but also our safety and cost. Fourth, we need to train and educate our employees at all levels of the organization to work smarter and lead better. Fifth, we need to be vigilant with our commercial service customers and actively monitor their financial condition and payment status with us as they remain challenged with occupancy and now refinancing issues. And finally, we always look to gain SG&A leverage. However, we always will have areas beyond our control that could affect our performance. Number one, material sourcing and lead times continue to challenge the market and our customers. I don't think that's improving in 2023, not much anyway. Number two, higher interest rates and economic uncertainty may impact the demand for some of our customers' products and services, and then it will impact us. I expect this will move some projects in the planning stage to later periods, and those in the decision stage may be postponed, rephased or rescoped. Number three, disruption caused by uncertain energy markets and supply, especially as the conflict in Ukraine continues and it could potentially intensify. OPEC took supply out of the market and China is reopening increases demand. However, we expect to continue to generate strong operating cash flow, and we'll continue to execute our long-term and successful capital allocation strategy that balances supporting our organic growth and acquisition, while returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Finally, as always, I would like to continue to thank the EMCOR team because none of this would be possible without your discipline, teamwork and dedication to drive the best possible results for our customers. And as a result of serving our customers so well, we continue to produce outstanding results for our shareholders. And with that, Keith, I will take questions Good morning, Brent. Thank you. I mean so that's why we did the enhanced disclosure. Then you can see the yellow bars traditional commercial. And it's the part that's up leased year-over-year, and it's essentially flat from year-end. Now part of that is a result of we're starting to burn through. That's where you really saw the impact of elongated supply lines because those projects that we do, for the most part, are meant to be quicker hitting. So if you think about EMCOR's commercial backlog, probably less than 1% of what we do today to 1.5% is what I would call new out-of-the-ground commercial or high-rise residential. At one time, that was very different. The bulk of the business that's in that traditional yellow section or even that pink section, probably that pink section has you could take that pink section and spread it across all our other sectors there, the short duration projects, but that yellow for the most part, is aftermarket. It's short duration projects. It's not short duration. It's major retrofit. It's retrofit. It's tenant build-out. It's ad moves and changes. It's where our longer duration energy retrofit projects are. It's that kind of stuff is the fast provider of what we do in commercial now. And then as you move up, right, we talked about the maroon and the green, I mean, the reality is that's a good breakout, right, because that's where the growth is coming for us. And like we said, that growth was coming even before the enhanced legislation. I'd like the CHIPS Act and IRA, we expect that to even continue more and I talked about it maybe growth or elongation. But we're careful in that commercial sector. We've been careful in that commercial sector for a long time. We're especially careful when it's developer-led. We pay attention to a lot of collections, and we pay attention to their financing. Do I think new grow commercial is a growth market right now? No. Do I think there's opportunities with well-capitalized customers? The answer is yes. Do I think the energy efficiency market has legs for a lot to go? And I like the way we service that energy efficiency market and the short duration project market. We service that through a lot of different channels. We go direct to the owner. We go to the owners what would be called their in-house general contractor or construction manager that may run all their projects like in a university or a manufacturing setting, but we're the contractor of choice and have been there for a while. We go through the large real estate providers and facilities managers. We go through that channel. We go through utilities that have programs where they help fund and direct and they have the salespeople that work with us to sell the project. And then we go through the major ESCOs where they may sell projects and now they actually have people actually have to go figure out how to get it done. And we have the sales force that knows how to sell to them and sell every one of those channels. And so we like that position. We think that market has legs. So it's a complex answer, but that's why we did the enhanced disclosure because we were thinking -- we were starting to make it harder for us to have people understand where the real growth and what that commercial sector the way we traditionally defined it was. It's both, Brent. It's both, right? $0.01 specific customers drive that backlog because they can be large projects. But if you look over a two or three year period, over time and the way we think about it is part of a broader trend. They got, quite frankly, disrupted a little bit with COVID because they weren't building new facilities in the middle of COVID. They were building emergency facilities been on new facilities or retrofitting so you can do multiuse. So some of this is pent-up demand or what should have been capital planning, but it's a long-term trend. Hospitals and big healthcare facilities and out paid facilities, they need to be cleaner. They need to have better ventilation they need to have an ability to flex from positive pressure to negative pressure in our world. They have much more complex low-voltage needs. They have much more complex general electrical needs they have to put backup power. And while they're doing all that, they have to think about their sustainability goals and how they're going to operate that facility more efficiently. I think I would say probably electrical more than mechanical, it's a more consolidated market for major end products, and it's more on the critical path. So we've had to rejigger our means and methods to work around that. Mechanically, we buy a lot of equipment, we do a lot of HVAC work. We also do a lot of district piping work supporting big process plants or where the owner bought the equipment. And so they do that in the electrical business, too, for major gear. But my experience has been when you look at things like generators and switchgears and smart panels, the delivery performance is not great yet. The mechanical has gotten a little better, at least what they say they're going to do, they do. But the electrical lead times haven't really moved much down at all. The mechanicals have started to move down a little bit. And I think, in general, the mechanical sales forces are more in tune with their factories. And I think they have better visibility to keep us up to date on what's happening than the electrical sales force. Yeah. Thanks, Adam. Look, we think things have gotten better. We like where our shop backlog is at. We like what that portends for the future. We think we're in a more normalized operating environment, which is good. We expect to continue to operate normally. We have no reason to believe we don't have a normal fall turnaround season coming up. I think the long pull in the 10 is a new product we have, right, or a new service, which is building these alternative energy, the renewables, especially around solar, and that's clogged up everywhere. But Mark, I mean... And that's reflected in our guidance. And part of that is reflected in our guidance takeup. There are certainly people way better qualified to talk about that than us as part of our business. But based on what we see, not good. It's still plugged up. I don't think there's going to be this big uptick this year. But again, that's sort of -- there's people who know a lot more about that to me, as someone that's followed it closely through our bidding and work, we see a lot of delayed work. Yes. I think there's \u2013 it's hard to tell. I mean the short duration projects have something that's been driving them for a while. And so there's this counterbalancing view out there, right, in my mind because of energy pricing. And people who drive for more sustainable facilities. So on one hand, you sit there and say, I just won't do the project. On the other hand, you say, every day, I don't do that project, my cost structure becomes worse because energy prices continue to become uncertain and escalate. And most of our major customers have committed to sustainability goals. And you can't get there unless you do equipment replacement and modernization and all -- something as simple as fixing the compressor lines in a manufacturing facility. That requires a lot of work. It requires new equipment. If you take out something that used to be 0.68 kw per tonne, and now you're putting in something with 0.32kw per tonne on a chiller, and it has variable speed -- that's a market change in your operating cost profile. And then you're going to start thinking about, okay, I have to do that. If I don't do that in these triple net leases, which has always been the vein to the existence of energy efficiency, my building may no longer be competitive, right? So I have all these forces going on around me. And so I think that if you're heavily exposed to new build commercial, you probably have a different outlook than we have on that. I also think, if you think of some of these major projects that are going on, on those big things I talked about from reshoring, EV, value chain, semiconductors, data centers. And remember, there's a whole ecosystem around each of those. I guess most of this was happening without government support. That can only help it now, and it can only elongate it in my mind. And most of these customers are not worried about a 500 basis point expansion in interest rate costs. One, they're self-funded for the most part and the kind of value they're going to create over what they're doing. And then you layer on top of that for some of these industries, the demand with respect to national security and the onshoring of some critical industries, I think that mix drives long-term demand in a favorable way. And look, for us, we have great RPOs. We expect to continue to have great RPOs. From this high level, that could plus or minus a little bit quarter-to-quarter, but we expect our overall trends over the next couple of years to be pretty good as -- in these major sectors, but we'll see. I don't know, Sean. I think taking our outlook up to $9.25 to $10 from $8.75 to $9.50, a pretty big move. I think the revenue velocities in the businesses, and we said that in our initial guidance, and I think further, if you extrapolate that, I think that what we're really saying in the guidance is we expect strong margins through the year. Now, we are mix dependent and projects start, they finish. But we -- there was nothing extraordinary in the first quarter, right, Mark? And I think the other thing that bolstered first quarter operating margins -- operating income margins is, this is a seasonally strong quarter for industrial. And so we have to factor in with second and third quarter mean to us there, especially if we can't deliver some of the solar work that we hope to deliver towards the back half of the year. So, -- and then I guess just general caution, right? I mean I talked about the things we don't control. And those are sizable macro forces we don't control. And so we think it's prudent to have an eye towards that. But I think we have a strong guidance out there to update us. We started the year with strong guidance. We updated that with strong guidance. And underlying that is what we believe, depending on where you are in that revenue range is pretty strong underlying operating performance. Yes, I mean we had a lot of -- I mean, when we start looking at this at the macro level though, right? There's a lot of puts and takes in any given quarter. And we think that with those countervailing macro forces and how they could impact the back of the year, we think that we put strong guidance out and we think we'll obviously end up somewhere in that range. And we got to execute well on the things that we can to keep those margins where they are and I went neater four or five points that we think are most important. I don't think it impacts our ability to do what we think we need to execute other things we would like to execute. I think though, Sean, we know this, right, if the overall M&A environment is not favorable, less things may be for sale, right? Now, a lot of the things we buy are necessarily in that typical M&A market. most of the deals we've done over the last three years have been people selling their life's work, which is where we operate the best, right? That's where we are the most successful, and we also drive the most value, not only for the person selling the business because they have a lot of things we're looking at, but for our shareholders, and it gives us new opportunities to grow. But look, private equity is not much in the market right now between interest rates, covenants and credit tightening and the ability to place their secondary debt. They're not in the market, people that want a robust auction around the process, therefore, are trying to sell their companies right now. And so put all that together, it's no secret. I mean, you follow the same things we do. M&A volumes are down significantly. That being said, for the kinds of things we do, I don't think it -- I would say, oh, my god, it's the most robust pipeline I've ever seen. But what we have was, I think, is an acceptable pipeline of opportunities for us to pursue to continue to build on our footprint, add to our capability, and enhance the services we're offering across a number of geographies or new geographies or product lines would like to add a product services would like that. Thank you. Thank you very much all. We started well in 2023. We got a lot of work ahead of us. And I hope you all are well. Have a good summer and be safe."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the EMCOR Group Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Andy Backman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Backman, you may begin.\nAndy Backman: Thank you, Chuck, and good morning everyone and welcome to EMCOR's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. For those of you joining us by webcast, we are at the beginning of our slide presentation that will accompany our results today. The presentation will be archived in the Investor Relations section of our website at emcorgroup.com. With me today are Tony Guzzi, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jason Nalbandian, Senior Vice President and EMCOR's Chief Financial Officer; and Maxine Mauricio, Executive Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel. For today's call, Tony will provide comments on our third quarter. Jason will then review the third quarter numbers before turning it back to Tony to discuss RPOs, as well as reviewing our revised 2024 guidance before we open it up for Q&A. Before we begin, as a reminder, this presentation and discussion contain certain forward-looking statements and may contain certain non-GAAP financial information. Slide two of our presentation describes in detail these forward-looking statements and the non-GAAP financial information disclosures. I encourage everyone to review both disclosures in conjunction with our discussion and accompanying slides. And finally, as a reminder, all financial information discussed during this morning's call is included in our consolidated financial statements within both our earnings press release issued this morning and in our Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tony. Tony?\nTony Guzzi: Yes. Thanks much, Andy and I'll be speaking mainly just Page 4 of this opening. In the third quarter of 2024, our team continued to perform exceptionally well and delivered another great quarter. When you compare it to the third quarter of 2023, we had record revenues of $3.7 billion, which represents growth of 15.3% revenue growth. We had record operating income of $363.5 million, which was a 54.7% increase and we more than doubled our operating cash flow to $526 million. Our RPOs grew to a record $9.8 billion in the quarter, up $1.15 billion or 13.4% from the prior year quarter and we earned diluted earnings per share of $5.80 compared to $3.57 for the third quarter of 2023. Our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments continued their impressive performance with a combined third quarter operating margin of 13.3% and individual operating margins of 14.1% and 12.9% respectively. How this happens is through excellent field leadership that continued to drive this outstanding execution through relentless attention to detail and constant innovation across the project life cycle. That begins with project and customer selection, estimating contract structure and negotiation, significant use of VDC which is virtual design construct. We used to talk about it as BIM. Now we talk about is a more holistic approach with virtual design construct, which leads to prefabrication, labor planning and training, commissioning and finally, all the way through the diligent collection of receivables. Our teams then incorporate these learnings into the next opportunity to make them even more successful and productive for our customers. We do have a continuous improvement and learning culture here at EMCOR. And when you couple that great execution with a strong mix of work that includes data centers, semiconductor plants, other high-tech and traditional manufacturing, institutional water and waste water and good aftermarket service and project opportunities including in the commercial sector, then our impressive performance is the end result. We are executing this diverse work and expanding into these resilient sectors with our growth over the last five years occurring through a combination of greenfield expansion, robust train once we do the greenfield expansions and complementary acquisitions. We do have some of the best leadership at the segment and subsidiary levels and they work together to share best practices and drive results across our mechanical and electrical trades. The result is this exceptional outcome for our customers and as a result of that strong performance for our shareholders. Our Building Services segment continues to perform as we expected to perform this year, with very strong Mechanical Services performance and an overall operating margin of 7%, despite the previously discussed loss contracts in our site-based businesses. During the third quarter of 2024, our Mechanical Services business benefited from strong performance across its whole product line and portfolio work, including service maintenance agreements, repair services, HVAC retrofits and building controls upgrades. Our Industrial Services segment continues to experience a gradual resumption of normal demand, and we are performing well, both in the field and shops, and we are executing a normal fall turnaround season. Our U.K. business also continues to perform well in a difficult market. We are winning new work and are poised to secure additional opportunities with customers that demand a strong technical solution for their facility services. At $9.8 billion, we have a strong base of RPOs to execute and we have a balance sheet, which will enable us to continue to compete, win and grow in the future. With all that said, I think we can all agree it was a great quarter, exceptional performance by our team. And with that, Jason, I will turn the call over to you, and you will provide more details on our quarterly results.\nJason Nalbandian: Thank you, Tony. Over the next several slides, I'll review the operating performance for each of our segments as well as some of the key financial data for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. I'm going to start here on Slide 5, which is revenues. As Tony mentioned, consolidated revenues were a quarterly record at $3.7 billion, an increase of $489.3 million, or 15.3%. Led by our Construction segments, we continue to execute well and demand remains strong across most of the large and growing sectors that we serve. On an organic basis, revenues grew by 12.6%. Looking at our segments. Revenues of U.S. Electrical Construction were $845 million, an increase of 21.2%. This segment continues to benefit from increased demand across many market sectors with the most significant growth coming once again from network and communications due to our data center project demand. This segment additionally experienced notable increases in renews within high-tech manufacturing, as well as the institutional and manufacturing and industrial sectors. In the quarter, revenue growth within manufacturing and industrial was partially driven by the completion of certain battery energy storage projects. U.S. Mechanical Construction revenues were $1.66 billion, increasing 25%. Demand in this segment continues to be broad-based, and we once again saw growth in the majority of the markets in which we operate. While the strongest growth was seen in high-tech manufacturing and networking communications, we also experienced notable increases within institutional and health care. The segment additionally benefited from greater levels of service work. As we expected and consistent with my comments last quarter, partially offsetting the growth for both of our construction segments was a decrease in revenues from the commercial sector due to either the reduced demand across the commercial real estate industry or the completion of various warehousing and distribution projects, which were active a year ago. Together, our domestic construction segments generated revenues of $2.5 billion, which is an increase of nearly 24%. If we look at U.S. Building Services, revenues were $796.9 million, representing a decrease of 2.5% due to the non-renewal of certain facilities maintenance contracts that we've discussed on prior calls. A nearly $78 million decrease from our commercial and government site-based operations more than offset the continued strength from our Mechanical Services division, which grew revenues by $57 million in the quarter. There continues to be strong demand for mechanical services. And as Tony mentioned, we experienced growth across each of our service lines, including projects and retrofits, repair service, building automation and controls and service maintenance. If we move to Industrial Services, driven by greater demand across their field services division, including turnarounds of a larger size and scope growth on certain projects, revenues were $286.4 million, an increase of 13.6%. And lastly, U.K. Building Services delivered revenues of $106.4 million. While project revenue remains consistent with that of the year ago period, service revenues have declined, resulted a 4% decrease for this segment. Let's turn to Slide 6. For the quarter, we had operating income of $363.5 million, or 9.8% of revenues. Our performance established new quarterly records both for operating income and operating margin and compares favorably to operating income of $235 million, or 7.3% of revenues a year ago. Once again, if we look at each of our segments, U.S. Electrical reported operating income of $119.1 million which represents a nearly 89% increase. Operating margin was 14.1% which is a 500 basis point improvement. The segment generated increased gross profit and gross profit margin from the majority of the sectors in which we serve. In line with revenues, the most notable increases were experienced within network and communications. However, the segment also benefited from greater gross profit within the institutional, manufacturing and industrial and high-tech manufacturing sectors. Operating income for U.S. Mechanical Construction was $214.8 million an increase of just over 55% and operating margin of 12.9% expanded by 250 basis points. Similar to Electrical Construction, this segment experienced greater gross profit from the majority of the sectors we serve. The largest increases were generated within high-tech manufacturing and networking communications. While our commercial sector revenues have declined, we did experience an increase in gross profit from this sector due to a more favorable mix of work. And together our construction segments reported operating margin of 13.3%. Operating income for U.S. Building Services was $55.6 million, a slight decline year-over-year have our operating margin remain strong at 7% in both periods. Consistent with the segment's revenues increased gross profit and gross profit margin from our Mechanical Services division was offset by reductions within commercial and government due to the headwinds we previously referenced. Industrial Services operating income was $3.3 million or 1.1% of revenues versus essentially breakeven performance a year ago. This improvement was driven by higher gross profit margin from both field and shop services, due in part to better pricing and greater indirect cost absorption. As a reminder, the third quarter is typically a weaker quarter for the segment, accounting for the lower operating margin, when compared to the first half of the year. And lastly, U.K. Building Services reported operating income of $5.5 million or 5.2% of revenues. While project revenues have remained steady in the quarter, the U.K. saw a less favorable mix of work from a margin perspective, notably as their portfolio in the prior year included a greater number of higher-margin projects. When compared to projects of a more traditional profile, operating margins have declined in the U.K. by 280 basis points. If we turn to Slide 7, just a few highlights on this slide starting with gross profit. Due to a combination of revenue growth, improved mix, accelerate project execution, enhanced productivity and favorable pricing gross margin has expanded by 290 basis points and gross profit has increased by 35%. Our third quarter SG&A increased by $63 million, which includes $10.2 million of incremental expenses attributable to companies acquired. While our SG&A margin of 10% for the quarter has increased by 40 basis points our SG&A margin for the year-to-date period of 9.7% remains consistent with that of the prior year. Given the stronger-than-anticipated performance a true-up of operating company incentive accruals accounts for the quarterly increase in SG&A margin. And finally on this page, diluted earnings per share, was $5.80 compared to $3.57, an increase of 62.5%. If we briefly turn to Slide 8, you can see our performance for the first nine months of 2024. On a year-to-date basis we have grown revenues by 18.1% or 16.2% organically, and our diluted EPS of $15.21, represents a 72% increase from $8.85, a year ago. In a later slide, Tony will outline our updated earnings guidance for 2024. I mentioned that now, as it's our performance for the last two quarters as well as the year-to-date period which frames our guidance. If we look at the low-end of our guidance range we've assumed operating margins which are in line with the 8.9%, we have earned year-to-date. At the midpoint, we have assumed fourth quarter operating margins which reflect the average of our second and third quarter performance. And the high-end represents what we could achieve, if our fourth quarter margins are equal to the record margins we earned in this quarter. And finally, if we look at our balance sheet on Slide 9, our balance sheet remains strong and liquid and continues to be a differentiator for us in the market. Although not shown on this slide, operating cash flow for the quarter was approximately $526 million, which represents 145% of operating income. And on a year-to-date basis, we have generated $938 million of operating cash equivalent to 98% of operating income. Our significant cash generation leaves us well-positioned to continue to fund organic growth, pursue strategic M&A and return capital to shareholders, all of which we have demonstrated thus far this year. For the first nine months of 2024, we have utilized $189 million on acquisitions and returned $437 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $256 million of shares, bringing our year-to-date total to $405 million. With that, I will turn the call back to Tony for a discussion on our RPOs.\nTony Guzzi: Thanks Jason. And like I said all said, what a great quarter. As I discussed RPOs, I'd like you to take slides 10 and 11 together and put them side by side and we can see the themes driving our business. On slide 10 you can see the key trends in sectors where we are experiencing growth. If you look at data centers and connectivity, we continue to see strong demand for hyperscale data center work, which is included in network and communications sector. At the end of the quarter, RPOs in this sector were a record $2.1 billion, up $759 million or nearly 55% year-over-year and almost 25% sequentially. As I've said on prior calls, we believe that we are in the early innings of the overall data center expansion especially with the addition of AI and that we've successfully positioned ourselves in more data center key geographies over the past five years to serve our customers better. Reshoring and near-shoring continues to provide opportunity for us in both the high-tech manufacturing and traditional manufacturing and industrial sectors. In high-tech manufacturing, we have RPOs of $1.3 billion at the end of the third quarter and that includes semiconductor, pharma, biotech, life sciences and the electric vehicle value chain. RPOs in this sector were down 7% from the year ago period as we continue to work through a number of high-tech manufacturing projects, including the initial fab one of several semiconductor campuses. However, we believe the long-term fundamentals here are solid. And as we have stated before, we expect ebbs and flows in the award of this work. Many of these project sites are multi-year sites and we are working on or anticipate working on multiyear multiphase construction projects, for which we will generally only be awarded one phase at any given time or a part of the phase at any given time. While we believe we are well-positioned for these follow-on contracts they will be released in different amounts, different times and sometimes even under different contract sectors on these multiyear, multiphase building programs. In addition to the high-tech manufacturer, we continue to have a healthy dose base of RPOs within the traditional manufacturing and industrial sector, which totaled $921 million at the end of the quarter, up nearly 8% year-over-year and almost 18% sequentially. When you look at energy efficiency and sustainability, we continue to excel with retrofit project work especially within the Mechanical Services division of our US Building Services segment where we saw a year-over-year increase in RPOs of 4%. As a reminder, much of this work is focused on only retrofit replacement of aged equipment, but also reducing energy consumption by coupling more efficient equipment with a building automation upgrade. And lastly on this page health care is an area where we have excelled and we ended up the quarter at a record $1.2 billion in RPOs, up over 19% in the year ago period. Now I'll go to slide 11 and I'll finish this off. Water and wastewater now totaled $729 million, an increase of 21% sequentially and 18% year-over-year and for those new to the call this is a market for us, which is mainly focused in Florida. RPOs in the institutional sector, which includes project work for schools universities and local and state and federal buildings were up 19% year-over-year, coming in at a record $1.1 billion. Spending is on research facilities, enhanced and new classroom space, technology upgrades across campuses and renovation and retrofits with a goal of improved air quality and reduced energy consumption drives demand in this sector. Transportation grew over 10% sequentially and 66% year-over-year to approximately $305 million, driven by the award of certain infrastructure projects and short duration projects, which are small project work and it's across the gamut of work we do from building control upgrade, HVAC upgrades, electrical upgrades, technology enhancements, all in the built space. We're trying to make the buildings and campuses more efficient, energy-efficient smarter cleaner and more productive. They're at $473 million, essentially flat year-over-year. When you partially offset these increases was an expected decline within commercial. And again, for us, that's new construction that's driving that. And it's really not high-rise an office project but more some of the warehousing and distribution market that has slowed somewhat. RPOs in the commercial sector were $1.4 billion at the end of the third quarter but we did grow 3% sequentially. As I've mentioned earlier, our RPOs are $9.8 billion. They're up 13.4% or $1.15 billion from a year ago. And the question you're going to ask is what do you think? We like the mix we like the projects and we like the execution although we don't control totally the timing and execution of these projects as those RPOs roll out. We believe that the value and the type of mix of contract structure and work we have in those RPOs is similar to the work we've been executing over the last six quarters. Now I'm going to close on page 12 and 13. We've obviously performed very well during the first three quarters of 2024 and Jason talked about the record performance we had in the third quarter, especially with respect to operating margins. Our momentum has been strong, both on revenue growth and operating margin expansion. Our revenues have grown 18.1% on a year-to-date basis and our operating margin has expanded 250 basis points to 8.9%. As a result, we're going to raise our diluted earnings per share guidance to $20.50 to $21 and that's from our previous range of $19 to $20. And we expect to earn revenues of at least $14.5 billion. As we move into the year-end and look at the future, I always step back and reflect on what is working well and what are the challenges? And what's going well? Well, clearly we are positioned well in a set of growing and diverse sectors that demand excellence in execution, especially with respect to large projects. To better serve our customers, we've expanded our skills across geographies and sectors, and we do that by training people well. We've had greenfield expansion, complementary acquisitions and we continue to invest heavily in VDC and in our prefab, which results in better field execution and improve productivity. Our companies utilize peer learning and share best practices on means and methods to build capabilities and leverage our customer relations better at any time in our company's history. We leverage our corporate staff and segment staff very well to improve outcomes, not only on contract negotiations and planning but human resources planning, cyber, IT, financial discipline, which includes management planning, cash collection, marketing, risk management, which for us means insurance in this case, to gain the benefits of expertise in the learning that we've had, especially over the last five years as we build more and more of these scale products to also leverage our scale to improve outcomes first for our customers and our employees. We have invested in success over many years in leadership development with a focus on our core values and Mission First, People Always, and continue to develop our unique EMCOR operating system and practices. We always have opportunities to improve and I'll mention a short view. We always need to adjust our product offerings our project delivery. But in this case, we continue to need to enhance our ability to serve our customers through geographic expansion and skill transfer. We need to enhance our site-based service offerings to focus further on our technical services expertise as a point of differentiation versus the real estate firms. You are always going to face challenges in an uncertain world of supply chain, disruption, continued economic uncertainty, interest rates, geopolitical tensions, but our team has shown resilience and has overcome such challenges successfully in the past and there's no reason to believe we won't do that in the future. And again, we always go back to our culture of Mission First, People Always and our unique EMCOR operating model. And finally, you got to continue to invest on what's going well and you have to even do more investment in learning to make it even better. We've had a good mix of capital allocation this year from strong organic investment, acquisition investment and return of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We continue to pursue robust opportunities to invest more organic capital across our operations to support our VDC, which again reminding you of, virtual, design and construct and prefabrication efforts, but also continue to apply technology and improve productivity safety and efficiency from our back offices to project execution. You're going to ask about acquisitions. I've always had the attitude the deals happen when they happen. We are in discussions with many people across many years, help them come into the EMCOR family. And we've had a great track record of that over the last five years, especially on the execution and integration of those acquisitions. As always, I want to thank my EMCOR teammates for performing so well for our customers and for making EMCOR a great place to work, as we always strive to improve as a Mission First People Always culture. And with that Chuck, I'll take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nBrent Thielman: Hi, thanks. Good morning.\nTony Guzzi: Good morning, Brent.\nBrent Thielman: Hey, just first on growth in data center for you just continues to be remarkable. Tony, I was wondering if you could just talk around what's being supported by new build-out versus retrofit? And then as you think about retrofit down the line how much of an opportunity is that for you in that category?\nTony Guzzi: I think it's going to be a significant opportunity. But if you look today specifically, 90% plus of our work is new build. And probably two-thirds of that is on existing campuses and one-third of that is on new campuses. And Brent when we think about data centers actually to get ready for this call, I always reflect on what's changed over a 5-year period. If you go back to the middle of 2019 and you snap the line here at the end of the third quarter, we were serving electrically about 2.5 markets at the end of 2019. And the half is because it's not really a data center market. It's more of one of those places where they use to transfer data here around the New York area. And today, I counted at least 13 depending on how you count it 14 markets, we're serving electrically. And what's driving that is our customers. We execute well. We share learnings well. Our customers want us to expand in more markets and we do that a number of ways. And mechanically, we can finish on mechanical, we went from serving one data center market in 2019 to six today. And on the Fire Life Safety side, we can serve our customers pretty ubiquitously across the country. Again, understand what I'm saying, it's because our customers are asking us to help serve them better in more markets. So how do we do that? Well, we do that first by leveraging our capabilities and teaching folks that we already have in an existing subsidiary, how to do data center work and meet this most demanding market segment. So yes, the growth is remarkable, but these are some of the most demanding customers in the world. Second, we then combine that with organic investment in those subsidiaries and in our existing subsidiaries to deliver great results for those customers. And then where applicable we may buy into the data center market or \u2013 and that company has to do more than data centers. They have to be able to stand on their own in that market without the data center market. So you put all that together, that's how you serve that market. Now if you go look into the future here. And the next question should be okay, how much do you think is that tied to AI today? In the future, it will probably be one-third to half of what we're doing will be tied to AI. And the balance will be just cloud storage and expanding that. And eventually they interact with each other. I will tell you the AI power requirements are anywhere from five to six times in some cases what a traditional cloud storage data center will be. So what does that mean for us? It means enhanced scope. It means more requirement for planning. It requires more sophistication on the VDC side, which continues to make you understand why customers want us to expand with them into other markets. With that I'll stop. Jason, do you have anything to add?\nBrent Thielman: Very good. I appreciate all that Tony. And then profitability in Electrical is even better than the last few quarters, which were quite good. Are there any closeouts operational one-timers driving the 14% op margin, Tony? I know, there's always things in any given quarter but...\nJason Nalbandian: I think if you look at closeouts, if you look at what we disclosed, I think year-over-year there really isn't a drastic change that's accounting for the margins. I think as we've said, it continues to be driven by mix and execution. But I do think, right, you can never look at one quarter and say, that's an indicator of our margins. I think in this environment, I'd say looking at a 9- to 15-month rolling average is probably a good way to look at it.\nTony Guzzi: Yes. And the reason we say that is right, we don't control the timing of these projects. So at any given time, we could have especially our supervision sort of on the bench for us for a month or 1.5 months, as we wait for new projects to start up. It's always important to remember, I always have to recall back to early 2022, we saw the build happening. People were questioning whether this was going to be sustained. We thought yes, we held on to the key supervision. The margins got beat up a little bit in the first quarter of 2022 and here we are today. This is not a quarter-to-quarter business this is a long term -- you think about what we're trying to do here. We're trying to match our precious resources, which is our shop capacity, our VDC capability, our estimating, but most importantly our field supervision and labor on the means and method with what is a long-term capital build cycle across some high-impact sectors. And you can see that in our RPOs those high-impact sectors include data centers and connectivity. They include the aftermarket. They include high-tech manufacturing to include semiconductors. They include traditional manufacturing industrial. They include health care. They include water and wastewater. So we really value our field supervision. And we're taking that precious resource and thinking about how to line it up against those opportunities in the future and that's not a linear path to get there.\nBrent Thielman: Very good. Maybe just last one. Tony, I appreciate the comments around high-tech manufacturing that your visibility into these projects sort of extend several years. The timing can be episodic I get it. I was actually more curious on the RPO strength in manufacturing and industrial which sort of reflects things I guess outside of high tech. What are the sorts of things you're seeing there? And maybe what contributed to the strength this quarter? I found that uptick interesting.\nTony Guzzi: Yes, it's pretty broad-based, but it's the traditional things we've done. Again, it always goes back to those manufacturers drive for efficiency and automation and market expansion coupled with reshoring. And it's traditional things. It's food. It's general consumer goods. It's some effects of auto suppliers into the traditional automotive chain. It's suppliers doing everything from pumps and motors and all those things that support all these other projects we're doing in capacity expansion. So some of it is driven by capacity expansion to meet the more mundane areas of all these growth trends and then some of it's reshoring and the drive for automation. And look all these places you think about what's going on with energy prices. So we talk a lot about office buildings, office buildings, office buildings. But think about what a manufacturing plant uses, we're doing that work there too or they drive for energy efficiency and they get into a multiyear program with us to drive efficiency across their plant network. So that theme of driving down energy costs and reducing carbon footprint. But I will tell you it's led by cost right now because of the spike in energy prices and no one thinks they're going down anytime soon.\nJason Nalbandian: Yes. I think the only thing I would add to that, right I agree with everything Tony said, I think the near-shoring reshoring continues to be strong for us, continues to be a driver. If you're looking at RPO sequentially, I will say maybe we saw a little bit more strength in the food process side which Tony mentioned at the onset of this commentary. But just looking sequentially food is definitely a driver.\nTony Guzzi: Yeah. Absolutely.\nBrent Thielman: Excellent. Appreciate it. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: The next question will come from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Please go ahead.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey, good morning, guys. Congrats on another great quarter.\nTony Guzzi: Thank you.\nAdam Thalhimer: Tony, I wanted to ask about the revenue guidance first. What's kind of your message on the decline there?\nTony Guzzi: There's not a decline. We gave you a range of $14.5 billion to $15 billion now that we look at the project timing out of our RPOs we're at $14.5 billion. It always was meant to be a range. Now we're sort of zeroing in on year-end. And with 18.3% year-over-year growth in revenues I think we're doing okay.\nJason Nalbandian: Yes. To me I think as Tony said, it's looking at the RPOs that we have come in and the timing of when we expect those projects to kick off, right? There's always a natural lag between when a contract is awarded and when that contract ramps up. And this is just us revising our estimates of when we think those projects are going to ramp. So I don't necessarily view it as a reduction of or a loss of revenues as much as I view it as a timing.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. So that was my next question. That's perfect. So this was your best sequential backlog growth in two years. And my question is when do those jobs start?\nTony Guzzi: Some of them are starting right now. Some will start in the first quarter. Very few things we have in RPOs right now will start much past March. Most of it will start between now and the middle of March.\nAdam Thalhimer: And then with backlog growth accelerating and maybe a little push out in project timing, I guess, just curious if you had any high-level thoughts on '25 revenue growth you could share?\nTony Guzzi: Well Adam we've been doing this together for a while. No, we'll talk about 2025 in February. But clearly, with the RPO growth we are planning another year of growth right? Jason put together some interesting analysis because this sort of helps frame it for the long-term, right? First of all, we've spent a lot of time on this call already and justifiably so talking about sort of some of these outside growth sectors like data centers and high-tech manufacturing. Even if you strip that out and you look at this year, we're still growing in the underlying more traditional markets 7% revenue growth. And if you look over the last five years, and you say how are you growing versus non-res construction? We're growing about 250 basis points above that of what non-res construction. I typically said, we grow somewhere between 20% to 30% to 35% of non-res in a high-growth market. And in a slower growth market, when it's growing at GDP, we typically double that growth, right? So that's held true over the last five years which has been a very healthy growth market for non-res. So there's no reason for us to believe whatever the expectation for non-res is that we're likely to outperform it over a year period. Quarter-to-quarter you never quite know.\nAdam Thalhimer: Great. Okay. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Alex Dwyer with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAlex Dwyer: Hi, Tony, Jason, and Andy, good morning.\nTony Guzzi: Good morning, Alex.\nJason Nalbandian: Good morning, Alex.\nAndy Backman: Good morning, Alex.\nAlex Dwyer: Congrats on the quarter.\nTony Guzzi: Thanks.\nAlex Dwyer: I guess, I wanted to get your thoughts on what would happen, if there was a change in administration next year? And I guess the things that come to my mind would be the more focus on oil and gas plus on clean energy maybe tariffs and continued focus on domestic manufacturing. I'm not sure how to think about how impactful any of these could be to your business or if I'm missing anything but just any thoughts there would be helpful.\nTony Guzzi: Well, I always say so, you'll never hear me make partisan comments publicly and then maybe I'll give you my own thoughts. But the reality is we make money with Democrats and we make money with Republicans. So I think if you go into the broad themes is anybody likely not to want to see more manufacturing reshore into the United States? I think the answer to that is both want that to happen. I think the second thing you say one of the big drivers is semiconductors. Does anybody think that the situation between Taiwan and China is better today than it was when they did the CHIPS Act or even before the land was bought which was like five or seven years ago? Does anybody think that it's better today than it was two years ago? And do you think either the Republican or Democrat in this case either one of them not want to see the domestic chip manufacturing industry flourish? Well, the answer to that is, no. Do you think anybody wants to not see data center construction go and have AI be a real advantage in this country? And do you think that either one of them want to let significant US computing power and where companies want that overseas the answer to that is, no. So some of the big drivers, I think remain intact, because these are major forces driving it that have little to do with public policy, or I think they're more to do with geopolitical things and security. Then you go to the energy situation. I think there is a difference there. I don't think it will be as profound as people think. I personally think that we're going to have to have an all of the above strategy. But I think you're going to see oil and gas flourished under one versus the other more quickly. I think in any case, we're going to have to build more gas turbine plants in the next five years, because it's the only way to fill this energy gap that's going to be created because of all the things I talked about in the beginning of my answer. I think with one of them that will happen quicker. And with the other one we'll have to get into a little bit of a crisis for that to happen but it will happen. I think on the renewable side, not an area that we have huge exposure to we have some exposure, but not huge exposure like others I think remain to be seen. I do think that's been challenging anyway, and that will be more challenged if one wins versus the other. I think if you go long-term in the auto space, for us, we look at a lot of different scenarios with respect to our own fleet. We believe for what we do, hybrids will eventually come in as a viable solution somewhere in the next three to five years as it gets more into SUVs and pickup trucks and vans and those things. On the EV value chain something, we have exposure to. But of all these big trends is the one we have the least exposure to. It's been more of a fire-life safety mode as they build infrastructure. I think in that case, I don't know, either one of them will jump ahead one will be a market approach. I do think if one wins versus the other the tail pipe emissions standard will change pretty dramatically back to something that can actually maybe be accomplished. Put all that together, go back to my original comment, we've done well under Democratic administrations and we've done well over Republic administrations. What our shareholders pay this management team to do is adjust and adapt. We're not big on lobbying. We don't do that. We adjust and adapt we move on and that's the greatest thing about a contractor. That's how we're trained to think.\nAlex Dwyer: Got it. Appreciate the thoughts Tony. And then I guess just coming back to the high-tech manufacturing RPOs the return to sequential growth in the quarter. How should we think about the ability to keep growing these -- this end market RPO going forward as we think about the initial semi fab awards turning into follow-on awards. I'm just wondering if that could be a headwind?\nTony Guzzi: My gut tells me, talking to our folks on the ground and the conversations on the three areas that were most exposed to fabs electrically and mechanically more mechanical than electrical, is the sites we're on somewhere between now and the middle of the third quarter next year, we're likely to get another big award and it might come in pieces. That's likely to happen. And that's going to happen in two of the sites. The planning is well along the way and we're helping with some of the infrastructure planning as they get ready to do that. I think the building side of it is one part of it but then they got to staff it and run it for the long-term. And the people that are doing this have to do both. We don't have to do that. We just have to help them get it up and running and commission that. So, net-net, I think it's a great long-term market for us. I'm glad we have the capabilities we have and I'm glad we continue to invest and build more capabilities into that market.\nAlex Dwyer: Got it. Okay. And then I guess my last question the cash flows just continue to be super strong this year. I think in the beginning of the year you had given that 100% operating cash flow to net income guide. I think it's just -- it's been well above that for the year-to-date performance. How do we think about that? Was that overly conservative? Or is there something in the cash performance that has just significantly exceeded your expectations? And is that the right way to think about the business as we head to next year?\nTony Guzzi: Well, long-term, over three to four years, you can't collect more than net income right? That is the standard, right, 100% of net income. And why are we doing better than that right now. We're getting ahead on some of our contracts. We always focus on this net billings in excess as a major metric for us. And I'm going to let Jason jump in here in more detail. But the point is people say oh you sent bills. No that's not how that works, right? That means the project is going very well. And the schedule values and we've negotiated them to a way that we can keep ahead of cash a little bit or cash neutral on these projects. Sometimes we get prepayments ahead of time, to allow us to mobilize and go on the customer site. That's a negotiation. I will tie it back to a broader point, I'm going to turn it over to Jason, right? Our balance sheet is a major way that we compete, right? We have the capacity to do a lot of things with that balance sheet and we will. We will continue to look through the growth and acquisition. We are not afraid of -- we said that before for the right deal, we would move and go do that. We think that works. But in general, we're never going to be a high leverage company. And the reason for that is, you think of who we're working for. They are all cash focused, cash-rich customers. And when they point to long-term relationship with customers like -- contractors like us and partners, they want people that look like them with that respect. They want to know the job is going to get done. And so we've been able to get favorable contract terms. And that's really what allows us to be a little bit ahead, on cash versus net income. But long term, right, that doesn't work. Jason?\nJason Nalbandian: Yes. I think Tony, that's a great summary. I think long term, we will go back to that average that we always look at which is 100% of net income or 80% to 85% of operating income. When we look at this year, yes right now, we're 98% of operating income. I think we'll maintain that level through the end of the year. We'll have another strong cash generation quarter in Q4. But I think over the long term, we have to revert back to that traditional metric.\nTony Guzzi: Jason and I had a very wise colleague, that ran our construction business for years. He would say, Tony, you can only collect the cash once. And that's how you get back to cash flow equals net income.\nAlex Dwyer: Got it. Appreciate the thoughts. Thanks\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Tony Guzzi for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nTony Guzzi: Thank you all for your interest in EMCOR. I know that the audience listening is broader than just our sell-side analysts. So, thank you all. And if you're invested in our company, we appreciate that. Again, I want to go back and circle around and thank our field leadership and all of our teammates at EMCOR. It's really been an extraordinary five-year of performance as we continue to grow. And with that, Andy I'll turn the call back over to you.\nAndy Backman: Yes. Thanks, Tony. Thanks, Jason, Maxine and everybody for joining us. Before we close the call as we announced this morning, Tony, Jason and I will be participating in the Baird 2024 Global Industrial Conference in Chicago, including one-on-ones and a webcast fireside chat on Tuesday November 12 at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time. We hope to see many of you there. As always, if you should have any follow-up questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly. Thank you all and have a great day. And Chuck, could you please close the call?\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tony Guzzi",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks much, Andy and I'll be speaking mainly just Page 4 of this opening. In the third quarter of 2024, our team continued to perform exceptionally well and delivered another great quarter. When you compare it to the third quarter of 2023, we had record revenues of $3.7 billion, which represents growth of 15.3% revenue growth. We had record operating income of $363.5 million, which was a 54.7% increase and we more than doubled our operating cash flow to $526 million. Our RPOs grew to a record $9.8 billion in the quarter, up $1.15 billion or 13.4% from the prior year quarter and we earned diluted earnings per share of $5.80 compared to $3.57 for the third quarter of 2023. Our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments continued their impressive performance with a combined third quarter operating margin of 13.3% and individual operating margins of 14.1% and 12.9% respectively. How this happens is through excellent field leadership that continued to drive this outstanding execution through relentless attention to detail and constant innovation across the project life cycle. That begins with project and customer selection, estimating contract structure and negotiation, significant use of VDC which is virtual design construct. We used to talk about it as BIM. Now we talk about is a more holistic approach with virtual design construct, which leads to prefabrication, labor planning and training, commissioning and finally, all the way through the diligent collection of receivables. Our teams then incorporate these learnings into the next opportunity to make them even more successful and productive for our customers. We do have a continuous improvement and learning culture here at EMCOR. And when you couple that great execution with a strong mix of work that includes data centers, semiconductor plants, other high-tech and traditional manufacturing, institutional water and waste water and good aftermarket service and project opportunities including in the commercial sector, then our impressive performance is the end result. We are executing this diverse work and expanding into these resilient sectors with our growth over the last five years occurring through a combination of greenfield expansion, robust train once we do the greenfield expansions and complementary acquisitions. We do have some of the best leadership at the segment and subsidiary levels and they work together to share best practices and drive results across our mechanical and electrical trades. The result is this exceptional outcome for our customers and as a result of that strong performance for our shareholders. Our Building Services segment continues to perform as we expected to perform this year, with very strong Mechanical Services performance and an overall operating margin of 7%, despite the previously discussed loss contracts in our site-based businesses. During the third quarter of 2024, our Mechanical Services business benefited from strong performance across its whole product line and portfolio work, including service maintenance agreements, repair services, HVAC retrofits and building controls upgrades. Our Industrial Services segment continues to experience a gradual resumption of normal demand, and we are performing well, both in the field and shops, and we are executing a normal fall turnaround season. Our U.K. business also continues to perform well in a difficult market. We are winning new work and are poised to secure additional opportunities with customers that demand a strong technical solution for their facility services. At $9.8 billion, we have a strong base of RPOs to execute and we have a balance sheet, which will enable us to continue to compete, win and grow in the future. With all that said, I think we can all agree it was a great quarter, exceptional performance by our team. And with that, Jason, I will turn the call over to you, and you will provide more details on our quarterly results. Thanks Jason. And like I said all said, what a great quarter. As I discussed RPOs, I'd like you to take slides 10 and 11 together and put them side by side and we can see the themes driving our business. On slide 10 you can see the key trends in sectors where we are experiencing growth. If you look at data centers and connectivity, we continue to see strong demand for hyperscale data center work, which is included in network and communications sector. At the end of the quarter, RPOs in this sector were a record $2.1 billion, up $759 million or nearly 55% year-over-year and almost 25% sequentially. As I've said on prior calls, we believe that we are in the early innings of the overall data center expansion especially with the addition of AI and that we've successfully positioned ourselves in more data center key geographies over the past five years to serve our customers better. Reshoring and near-shoring continues to provide opportunity for us in both the high-tech manufacturing and traditional manufacturing and industrial sectors. In high-tech manufacturing, we have RPOs of $1.3 billion at the end of the third quarter and that includes semiconductor, pharma, biotech, life sciences and the electric vehicle value chain. RPOs in this sector were down 7% from the year ago period as we continue to work through a number of high-tech manufacturing projects, including the initial fab one of several semiconductor campuses. However, we believe the long-term fundamentals here are solid. And as we have stated before, we expect ebbs and flows in the award of this work. Many of these project sites are multi-year sites and we are working on or anticipate working on multiyear multiphase construction projects, for which we will generally only be awarded one phase at any given time or a part of the phase at any given time. While we believe we are well-positioned for these follow-on contracts they will be released in different amounts, different times and sometimes even under different contract sectors on these multiyear, multiphase building programs. In addition to the high-tech manufacturer, we continue to have a healthy dose base of RPOs within the traditional manufacturing and industrial sector, which totaled $921 million at the end of the quarter, up nearly 8% year-over-year and almost 18% sequentially. When you look at energy efficiency and sustainability, we continue to excel with retrofit project work especially within the Mechanical Services division of our US Building Services segment where we saw a year-over-year increase in RPOs of 4%. As a reminder, much of this work is focused on only retrofit replacement of aged equipment, but also reducing energy consumption by coupling more efficient equipment with a building automation upgrade. And lastly on this page health care is an area where we have excelled and we ended up the quarter at a record $1.2 billion in RPOs, up over 19% in the year ago period. Now I'll go to slide 11 and I'll finish this off. Water and wastewater now totaled $729 million, an increase of 21% sequentially and 18% year-over-year and for those new to the call this is a market for us, which is mainly focused in Florida. RPOs in the institutional sector, which includes project work for schools universities and local and state and federal buildings were up 19% year-over-year, coming in at a record $1.1 billion. Spending is on research facilities, enhanced and new classroom space, technology upgrades across campuses and renovation and retrofits with a goal of improved air quality and reduced energy consumption drives demand in this sector. Transportation grew over 10% sequentially and 66% year-over-year to approximately $305 million, driven by the award of certain infrastructure projects and short duration projects, which are small project work and it's across the gamut of work we do from building control upgrade, HVAC upgrades, electrical upgrades, technology enhancements, all in the built space. We're trying to make the buildings and campuses more efficient, energy-efficient smarter cleaner and more productive. They're at $473 million, essentially flat year-over-year. When you partially offset these increases was an expected decline within commercial. And again, for us, that's new construction that's driving that. And it's really not high-rise an office project but more some of the warehousing and distribution market that has slowed somewhat. RPOs in the commercial sector were $1.4 billion at the end of the third quarter but we did grow 3% sequentially. As I've mentioned earlier, our RPOs are $9.8 billion. They're up 13.4% or $1.15 billion from a year ago. And the question you're going to ask is what do you think? We like the mix we like the projects and we like the execution although we don't control totally the timing and execution of these projects as those RPOs roll out. We believe that the value and the type of mix of contract structure and work we have in those RPOs is similar to the work we've been executing over the last six quarters. Now I'm going to close on page 12 and 13. We've obviously performed very well during the first three quarters of 2024 and Jason talked about the record performance we had in the third quarter, especially with respect to operating margins. Our momentum has been strong, both on revenue growth and operating margin expansion. Our revenues have grown 18.1% on a year-to-date basis and our operating margin has expanded 250 basis points to 8.9%. As a result, we're going to raise our diluted earnings per share guidance to $20.50 to $21 and that's from our previous range of $19 to $20. And we expect to earn revenues of at least $14.5 billion. As we move into the year-end and look at the future, I always step back and reflect on what is working well and what are the challenges? And what's going well? Well, clearly we are positioned well in a set of growing and diverse sectors that demand excellence in execution, especially with respect to large projects. To better serve our customers, we've expanded our skills across geographies and sectors, and we do that by training people well. We've had greenfield expansion, complementary acquisitions and we continue to invest heavily in VDC and in our prefab, which results in better field execution and improve productivity. Our companies utilize peer learning and share best practices on means and methods to build capabilities and leverage our customer relations better at any time in our company's history. We leverage our corporate staff and segment staff very well to improve outcomes, not only on contract negotiations and planning but human resources planning, cyber, IT, financial discipline, which includes management planning, cash collection, marketing, risk management, which for us means insurance in this case, to gain the benefits of expertise in the learning that we've had, especially over the last five years as we build more and more of these scale products to also leverage our scale to improve outcomes first for our customers and our employees. We have invested in success over many years in leadership development with a focus on our core values and Mission First, People Always, and continue to develop our unique EMCOR operating system and practices. We always have opportunities to improve and I'll mention a short view. We always need to adjust our product offerings our project delivery. But in this case, we continue to need to enhance our ability to serve our customers through geographic expansion and skill transfer. We need to enhance our site-based service offerings to focus further on our technical services expertise as a point of differentiation versus the real estate firms. You are always going to face challenges in an uncertain world of supply chain, disruption, continued economic uncertainty, interest rates, geopolitical tensions, but our team has shown resilience and has overcome such challenges successfully in the past and there's no reason to believe we won't do that in the future. And again, we always go back to our culture of Mission First, People Always and our unique EMCOR operating model. And finally, you got to continue to invest on what's going well and you have to even do more investment in learning to make it even better. We've had a good mix of capital allocation this year from strong organic investment, acquisition investment and return of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We continue to pursue robust opportunities to invest more organic capital across our operations to support our VDC, which again reminding you of, virtual, design and construct and prefabrication efforts, but also continue to apply technology and improve productivity safety and efficiency from our back offices to project execution. You're going to ask about acquisitions. I've always had the attitude the deals happen when they happen. We are in discussions with many people across many years, help them come into the EMCOR family. And we've had a great track record of that over the last five years, especially on the execution and integration of those acquisitions. As always, I want to thank my EMCOR teammates for performing so well for our customers and for making EMCOR a great place to work, as we always strive to improve as a Mission First People Always culture. And with that Chuck, I'll take questions. Good morning, Brent. I think it's going to be a significant opportunity. But if you look today specifically, 90% plus of our work is new build. And probably two-thirds of that is on existing campuses and one-third of that is on new campuses. And Brent when we think about data centers actually to get ready for this call, I always reflect on what's changed over a 5-year period. If you go back to the middle of 2019 and you snap the line here at the end of the third quarter, we were serving electrically about 2.5 markets at the end of 2019. And the half is because it's not really a data center market. It's more of one of those places where they use to transfer data here around the New York area. And today, I counted at least 13 depending on how you count it 14 markets, we're serving electrically. And what's driving that is our customers. We execute well. We share learnings well. Our customers want us to expand in more markets and we do that a number of ways. And mechanically, we can finish on mechanical, we went from serving one data center market in 2019 to six today. And on the Fire Life Safety side, we can serve our customers pretty ubiquitously across the country. Again, understand what I'm saying, it's because our customers are asking us to help serve them better in more markets. So how do we do that? Well, we do that first by leveraging our capabilities and teaching folks that we already have in an existing subsidiary, how to do data center work and meet this most demanding market segment. So yes, the growth is remarkable, but these are some of the most demanding customers in the world. Second, we then combine that with organic investment in those subsidiaries and in our existing subsidiaries to deliver great results for those customers. And then where applicable we may buy into the data center market or \u2013 and that company has to do more than data centers. They have to be able to stand on their own in that market without the data center market. So you put all that together, that's how you serve that market. Now if you go look into the future here. And the next question should be okay, how much do you think is that tied to AI today? In the future, it will probably be one-third to half of what we're doing will be tied to AI. And the balance will be just cloud storage and expanding that. And eventually they interact with each other. I will tell you the AI power requirements are anywhere from five to six times in some cases what a traditional cloud storage data center will be. So what does that mean for us? It means enhanced scope. It means more requirement for planning. It requires more sophistication on the VDC side, which continues to make you understand why customers want us to expand with them into other markets. With that I'll stop. Jason, do you have anything to add? Yes. And the reason we say that is right, we don't control the timing of these projects. So at any given time, we could have especially our supervision sort of on the bench for us for a month or 1.5 months, as we wait for new projects to start up. It's always important to remember, I always have to recall back to early 2022, we saw the build happening. People were questioning whether this was going to be sustained. We thought yes, we held on to the key supervision. The margins got beat up a little bit in the first quarter of 2022 and here we are today. This is not a quarter-to-quarter business this is a long term -- you think about what we're trying to do here. We're trying to match our precious resources, which is our shop capacity, our VDC capability, our estimating, but most importantly our field supervision and labor on the means and method with what is a long-term capital build cycle across some high-impact sectors. And you can see that in our RPOs those high-impact sectors include data centers and connectivity. They include the aftermarket. They include high-tech manufacturing to include semiconductors. They include traditional manufacturing industrial. They include health care. They include water and wastewater. So we really value our field supervision. And we're taking that precious resource and thinking about how to line it up against those opportunities in the future and that's not a linear path to get there. Yes, it's pretty broad-based, but it's the traditional things we've done. Again, it always goes back to those manufacturers drive for efficiency and automation and market expansion coupled with reshoring. And it's traditional things. It's food. It's general consumer goods. It's some effects of auto suppliers into the traditional automotive chain. It's suppliers doing everything from pumps and motors and all those things that support all these other projects we're doing in capacity expansion. So some of it is driven by capacity expansion to meet the more mundane areas of all these growth trends and then some of it's reshoring and the drive for automation. And look all these places you think about what's going on with energy prices. So we talk a lot about office buildings, office buildings, office buildings. But think about what a manufacturing plant uses, we're doing that work there too or they drive for energy efficiency and they get into a multiyear program with us to drive efficiency across their plant network. So that theme of driving down energy costs and reducing carbon footprint. But I will tell you it's led by cost right now because of the spike in energy prices and no one thinks they're going down anytime soon. Yeah. Absolutely. Thank you. There's not a decline. We gave you a range of $14.5 billion to $15 billion now that we look at the project timing out of our RPOs we're at $14.5 billion. It always was meant to be a range. Now we're sort of zeroing in on year-end. And with 18.3% year-over-year growth in revenues I think we're doing okay. Some of them are starting right now. Some will start in the first quarter. Very few things we have in RPOs right now will start much past March. Most of it will start between now and the middle of March. Well Adam we've been doing this together for a while. No, we'll talk about 2025 in February. But clearly, with the RPO growth we are planning another year of growth right? Jason put together some interesting analysis because this sort of helps frame it for the long-term, right? First of all, we've spent a lot of time on this call already and justifiably so talking about sort of some of these outside growth sectors like data centers and high-tech manufacturing. Even if you strip that out and you look at this year, we're still growing in the underlying more traditional markets 7% revenue growth. And if you look over the last five years, and you say how are you growing versus non-res construction? We're growing about 250 basis points above that of what non-res construction. I typically said, we grow somewhere between 20% to 30% to 35% of non-res in a high-growth market. And in a slower growth market, when it's growing at GDP, we typically double that growth, right? So that's held true over the last five years which has been a very healthy growth market for non-res. So there's no reason for us to believe whatever the expectation for non-res is that we're likely to outperform it over a year period. Quarter-to-quarter you never quite know. Good morning, Alex. Thanks. Well, I always say so, you'll never hear me make partisan comments publicly and then maybe I'll give you my own thoughts. But the reality is we make money with Democrats and we make money with Republicans. So I think if you go into the broad themes is anybody likely not to want to see more manufacturing reshore into the United States? I think the answer to that is both want that to happen. I think the second thing you say one of the big drivers is semiconductors. Does anybody think that the situation between Taiwan and China is better today than it was when they did the CHIPS Act or even before the land was bought which was like five or seven years ago? Does anybody think that it's better today than it was two years ago? And do you think either the Republican or Democrat in this case either one of them not want to see the domestic chip manufacturing industry flourish? Well, the answer to that is, no. Do you think anybody wants to not see data center construction go and have AI be a real advantage in this country? And do you think that either one of them want to let significant US computing power and where companies want that overseas the answer to that is, no. So some of the big drivers, I think remain intact, because these are major forces driving it that have little to do with public policy, or I think they're more to do with geopolitical things and security. Then you go to the energy situation. I think there is a difference there. I don't think it will be as profound as people think. I personally think that we're going to have to have an all of the above strategy. But I think you're going to see oil and gas flourished under one versus the other more quickly. I think in any case, we're going to have to build more gas turbine plants in the next five years, because it's the only way to fill this energy gap that's going to be created because of all the things I talked about in the beginning of my answer. I think with one of them that will happen quicker. And with the other one we'll have to get into a little bit of a crisis for that to happen but it will happen. I think on the renewable side, not an area that we have huge exposure to we have some exposure, but not huge exposure like others I think remain to be seen. I do think that's been challenging anyway, and that will be more challenged if one wins versus the other. I think if you go long-term in the auto space, for us, we look at a lot of different scenarios with respect to our own fleet. We believe for what we do, hybrids will eventually come in as a viable solution somewhere in the next three to five years as it gets more into SUVs and pickup trucks and vans and those things. On the EV value chain something, we have exposure to. But of all these big trends is the one we have the least exposure to. It's been more of a fire-life safety mode as they build infrastructure. I think in that case, I don't know, either one of them will jump ahead one will be a market approach. I do think if one wins versus the other the tail pipe emissions standard will change pretty dramatically back to something that can actually maybe be accomplished. Put all that together, go back to my original comment, we've done well under Democratic administrations and we've done well over Republic administrations. What our shareholders pay this management team to do is adjust and adapt. We're not big on lobbying. We don't do that. We adjust and adapt we move on and that's the greatest thing about a contractor. That's how we're trained to think. My gut tells me, talking to our folks on the ground and the conversations on the three areas that were most exposed to fabs electrically and mechanically more mechanical than electrical, is the sites we're on somewhere between now and the middle of the third quarter next year, we're likely to get another big award and it might come in pieces. That's likely to happen. And that's going to happen in two of the sites. The planning is well along the way and we're helping with some of the infrastructure planning as they get ready to do that. I think the building side of it is one part of it but then they got to staff it and run it for the long-term. And the people that are doing this have to do both. We don't have to do that. We just have to help them get it up and running and commission that. So, net-net, I think it's a great long-term market for us. I'm glad we have the capabilities we have and I'm glad we continue to invest and build more capabilities into that market. Well, long-term, over three to four years, you can't collect more than net income right? That is the standard, right, 100% of net income. And why are we doing better than that right now. We're getting ahead on some of our contracts. We always focus on this net billings in excess as a major metric for us. And I'm going to let Jason jump in here in more detail. But the point is people say oh you sent bills. No that's not how that works, right? That means the project is going very well. And the schedule values and we've negotiated them to a way that we can keep ahead of cash a little bit or cash neutral on these projects. Sometimes we get prepayments ahead of time, to allow us to mobilize and go on the customer site. That's a negotiation. I will tie it back to a broader point, I'm going to turn it over to Jason, right? Our balance sheet is a major way that we compete, right? We have the capacity to do a lot of things with that balance sheet and we will. We will continue to look through the growth and acquisition. We are not afraid of -- we said that before for the right deal, we would move and go do that. We think that works. But in general, we're never going to be a high leverage company. And the reason for that is, you think of who we're working for. They are all cash focused, cash-rich customers. And when they point to long-term relationship with customers like -- contractors like us and partners, they want people that look like them with that respect. They want to know the job is going to get done. And so we've been able to get favorable contract terms. And that's really what allows us to be a little bit ahead, on cash versus net income. But long term, right, that doesn't work. Jason? Jason and I had a very wise colleague, that ran our construction business for years. He would say, Tony, you can only collect the cash once. And that's how you get back to cash flow equals net income. Thank you all for your interest in EMCOR. I know that the audience listening is broader than just our sell-side analysts. So, thank you all. And if you're invested in our company, we appreciate that. Again, I want to go back and circle around and thank our field leadership and all of our teammates at EMCOR. It's really been an extraordinary five-year of performance as we continue to grow. And with that, Andy I'll turn the call back over to you."

            "name": "Jason Nalbandian",
            "content": "Thank you, Tony. Over the next several slides, I'll review the operating performance for each of our segments as well as some of the key financial data for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. I'm going to start here on Slide 5, which is revenues. As Tony mentioned, consolidated revenues were a quarterly record at $3.7 billion, an increase of $489.3 million, or 15.3%. Led by our Construction segments, we continue to execute well and demand remains strong across most of the large and growing sectors that we serve. On an organic basis, revenues grew by 12.6%. Looking at our segments. Revenues of U.S. Electrical Construction were $845 million, an increase of 21.2%. This segment continues to benefit from increased demand across many market sectors with the most significant growth coming once again from network and communications due to our data center project demand. This segment additionally experienced notable increases in renews within high-tech manufacturing, as well as the institutional and manufacturing and industrial sectors. In the quarter, revenue growth within manufacturing and industrial was partially driven by the completion of certain battery energy storage projects. U.S. Mechanical Construction revenues were $1.66 billion, increasing 25%. Demand in this segment continues to be broad-based, and we once again saw growth in the majority of the markets in which we operate. While the strongest growth was seen in high-tech manufacturing and networking communications, we also experienced notable increases within institutional and health care. The segment additionally benefited from greater levels of service work. As we expected and consistent with my comments last quarter, partially offsetting the growth for both of our construction segments was a decrease in revenues from the commercial sector due to either the reduced demand across the commercial real estate industry or the completion of various warehousing and distribution projects, which were active a year ago. Together, our domestic construction segments generated revenues of $2.5 billion, which is an increase of nearly 24%. If we look at U.S. Building Services, revenues were $796.9 million, representing a decrease of 2.5% due to the non-renewal of certain facilities maintenance contracts that we've discussed on prior calls. A nearly $78 million decrease from our commercial and government site-based operations more than offset the continued strength from our Mechanical Services division, which grew revenues by $57 million in the quarter. There continues to be strong demand for mechanical services. And as Tony mentioned, we experienced growth across each of our service lines, including projects and retrofits, repair service, building automation and controls and service maintenance. If we move to Industrial Services, driven by greater demand across their field services division, including turnarounds of a larger size and scope growth on certain projects, revenues were $286.4 million, an increase of 13.6%. And lastly, U.K. Building Services delivered revenues of $106.4 million. While project revenue remains consistent with that of the year ago period, service revenues have declined, resulted a 4% decrease for this segment. Let's turn to Slide 6. For the quarter, we had operating income of $363.5 million, or 9.8% of revenues. Our performance established new quarterly records both for operating income and operating margin and compares favorably to operating income of $235 million, or 7.3% of revenues a year ago. Once again, if we look at each of our segments, U.S. Electrical reported operating income of $119.1 million which represents a nearly 89% increase. Operating margin was 14.1% which is a 500 basis point improvement. The segment generated increased gross profit and gross profit margin from the majority of the sectors in which we serve. In line with revenues, the most notable increases were experienced within network and communications. However, the segment also benefited from greater gross profit within the institutional, manufacturing and industrial and high-tech manufacturing sectors. Operating income for U.S. Mechanical Construction was $214.8 million an increase of just over 55% and operating margin of 12.9% expanded by 250 basis points. Similar to Electrical Construction, this segment experienced greater gross profit from the majority of the sectors we serve. The largest increases were generated within high-tech manufacturing and networking communications. While our commercial sector revenues have declined, we did experience an increase in gross profit from this sector due to a more favorable mix of work. And together our construction segments reported operating margin of 13.3%. Operating income for U.S. Building Services was $55.6 million, a slight decline year-over-year have our operating margin remain strong at 7% in both periods. Consistent with the segment's revenues increased gross profit and gross profit margin from our Mechanical Services division was offset by reductions within commercial and government due to the headwinds we previously referenced. Industrial Services operating income was $3.3 million or 1.1% of revenues versus essentially breakeven performance a year ago. This improvement was driven by higher gross profit margin from both field and shop services, due in part to better pricing and greater indirect cost absorption. As a reminder, the third quarter is typically a weaker quarter for the segment, accounting for the lower operating margin, when compared to the first half of the year. And lastly, U.K. Building Services reported operating income of $5.5 million or 5.2% of revenues. While project revenues have remained steady in the quarter, the U.K. saw a less favorable mix of work from a margin perspective, notably as their portfolio in the prior year included a greater number of higher-margin projects. When compared to projects of a more traditional profile, operating margins have declined in the U.K. by 280 basis points. If we turn to Slide 7, just a few highlights on this slide starting with gross profit. Due to a combination of revenue growth, improved mix, accelerate project execution, enhanced productivity and favorable pricing gross margin has expanded by 290 basis points and gross profit has increased by 35%. Our third quarter SG&A increased by $63 million, which includes $10.2 million of incremental expenses attributable to companies acquired. While our SG&A margin of 10% for the quarter has increased by 40 basis points our SG&A margin for the year-to-date period of 9.7% remains consistent with that of the prior year. Given the stronger-than-anticipated performance a true-up of operating company incentive accruals accounts for the quarterly increase in SG&A margin. And finally on this page, diluted earnings per share, was $5.80 compared to $3.57, an increase of 62.5%. If we briefly turn to Slide 8, you can see our performance for the first nine months of 2024. On a year-to-date basis we have grown revenues by 18.1% or 16.2% organically, and our diluted EPS of $15.21, represents a 72% increase from $8.85, a year ago. In a later slide, Tony will outline our updated earnings guidance for 2024. I mentioned that now, as it's our performance for the last two quarters as well as the year-to-date period which frames our guidance. If we look at the low-end of our guidance range we've assumed operating margins which are in line with the 8.9%, we have earned year-to-date. At the midpoint, we have assumed fourth quarter operating margins which reflect the average of our second and third quarter performance. And the high-end represents what we could achieve, if our fourth quarter margins are equal to the record margins we earned in this quarter. And finally, if we look at our balance sheet on Slide 9, our balance sheet remains strong and liquid and continues to be a differentiator for us in the market. Although not shown on this slide, operating cash flow for the quarter was approximately $526 million, which represents 145% of operating income. And on a year-to-date basis, we have generated $938 million of operating cash equivalent to 98% of operating income. Our significant cash generation leaves us well-positioned to continue to fund organic growth, pursue strategic M&A and return capital to shareholders, all of which we have demonstrated thus far this year. For the first nine months of 2024, we have utilized $189 million on acquisitions and returned $437 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $256 million of shares, bringing our year-to-date total to $405 million. With that, I will turn the call back to Tony for a discussion on our RPOs. I think if you look at closeouts, if you look at what we disclosed, I think year-over-year there really isn't a drastic change that's accounting for the margins. I think as we've said, it continues to be driven by mix and execution. But I do think, right, you can never look at one quarter and say, that's an indicator of our margins. I think in this environment, I'd say looking at a 9- to 15-month rolling average is probably a good way to look at it. Yes. I think the only thing I would add to that, right I agree with everything Tony said, I think the near-shoring reshoring continues to be strong for us, continues to be a driver. If you're looking at RPO sequentially, I will say maybe we saw a little bit more strength in the food process side which Tony mentioned at the onset of this commentary. But just looking sequentially food is definitely a driver. Yes. To me I think as Tony said, it's looking at the RPOs that we have come in and the timing of when we expect those projects to kick off, right? There's always a natural lag between when a contract is awarded and when that contract ramps up. And this is just us revising our estimates of when we think those projects are going to ramp. So I don't necessarily view it as a reduction of or a loss of revenues as much as I view it as a timing. Good morning, Alex. Yes. I think Tony, that's a great summary. I think long term, we will go back to that average that we always look at which is 100% of net income or 80% to 85% of operating income. When we look at this year, yes right now, we're 98% of operating income. I think we'll maintain that level through the end of the year. We'll have another strong cash generation quarter in Q4. But I think over the long term, we have to revert back to that traditional metric."

I encourage everyone to review both disclosures in conjunction with our discussion and accompanying slides. Finally, as a reminder, all financial information discussed during this morning's call is included in our consolidated financial statements within both our earnings press release issued this morning and in our Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tony. Tony?\nAnthony Guzzi: Yes. Thanks, Andy, and good morning, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call. I am going to begin my discussion on Page 4. We had an exceptional first half of the year at EMCOR, and our results for the second quarter of 2024 further illustrate our continued momentum and excellent execution in the field. Within the quarter, we set new quarterly records for revenues, operating income, operating margin and diluted earnings per share. We grew revenues by 20.4% to $3.67 billion, achieved a consolidated operating margin of 9.1% and earned $5.25 per diluted share. While revenues increased 17.7% organically, RPOs of $9 billion remained at near record levels, increasing $713 million or 8.6% versus the year-ago period. Our Mechanical and Electrical Construction segments are driving our record performance with organic revenue growth in both the quarter and year-to-date periods of over 33% in our Mechanical Construction segment and 18% in our Electrical Construction segment. We continue to be well positioned in the right geographies and market sectors. We are winning the right mix of work, estimating our opportunities with the appropriate contingency, negotiating our contracts with care, planning with discipline and executing our work with precision and innovation with year-to-date operating margins of 11.8% for Mechanical Construction and 11.5% for Electrical Construction. We continue to perform well in large and growing market sectors with strong demand anchored in favorable markets for which that includes high-tech and traditional manufacturing; network and communications, which includes data centers, institutional and health care that are benefiting from long-term secular trends. Our teams are executing with discipline and precision aided by the full range of virtual design and construction tools, we call that VDC. And that also includes BIM, which you've heard me talk about, building information modeling, as well as excellent prefabrication, fill planning, supply chain management and contract negotiation. These teams continue to focus on delivering impressive results for our customers on incredibly sophisticated and fast-paced projects with multiyear building plans. When we target these large sophisticated sites, we typically win 25% to 35% of the time. However, it is always important to remember, and I had said this on many of these calls, after the initial project award, future phases may be released in smaller increments potentially affect the timing and amount we recognize within our RPOs even if the cumulative revenue from these subsequent phases is equivalent to the initial award that we previously had in RPOs. This is partially reflected in the 2% decline in RPOs from the first quarter of 2024. Beyond our Construction segments, our U.S. Building Services segment is executing as we expected. Our Mechanical Services business is operating in high single-digit operating margins and is growing revenues at low double digits. We are experiencing strength in all our Mechanical Service lines, including repair service, service agreements, retrofit HVAC projects and building controls, installations and upgrades. However, as we discussed in our year-end 2023 call, on an annual basis, we have had nearly $300 million in revenue headwinds in our commercial site-based business due to the loss of certain facilities, maintenance contracts are rebid despite strong customer scores on our service delivery. Despite these headwinds, we still delivered quarterly and year-to-date operating margins of 6% and 5% in the U.S. Building Services segment. And revenues grew about as expected by 4.1% year-to-date. Our Industrial Services segment reported its best second quarter post pandemic. And we saw improved demand for both our shop and field services on both the quarterly and year-to-date basis. Our shops continue to perform well, and the Electrical business within this segment has experienced increased demand, both from traditional upstream and midstream customers as well as for certain renewable fuels projects. Our U.K. business continues to perform as expected and has had some success in building its pipeline and retooling its business development efforts. This segment had solid operating margins at 5.4% in the quarter and 5.3% on a year-to-date basis. We had strong operating cash flow of $412 million on a year-to-date basis, almost double from the year-ago period. As I have said, our RPOs remain at near-record levels at $9.0 billion, and I will discuss our -- that in more detail later, and our prospects remain strong. We successfully closed 4 acquisitions in the quarter for an aggregate upfront purchase price of $173 million net of cash acquired. These acquisitions bolster our Mechanical Construction, Building Services and our Industrial Services segment. With that opening, Jason, I'll turn it over to you.\nJason Nalbandian: Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Over the next several slides, I will review the operating performance of each of our segments as well as some of the key financial data for the second quarter of 2024 as compared to the second quarter of 2023. I'm going to start on Slide 5 with revenues. As Tony mentioned, consolidated revenues were $3.67 billion, an increase of $621.3 million or 20.4% as demand for our services continues to be strong across the majority of the market sectors we serve. Each of our reportable segments experienced year-over-year increases in revenues, and we achieved organic revenue growth of nearly 18%. Looking at each of our segments. Revenues of U.S. Electrical Construction were $800 million, an increase of 18%. This segment continues to benefit from increased demand across many market sectors with the most significant revenue growth once again coming from network and communications, which, as a reminder, is predominantly our data center projects. In addition, this segment experienced increases in revenues within the transportation, high-tech manufacturing and manufacturing and industrial market sectors. Revenues for U.S. Mechanical Construction were $1.7 billion, increasing nearly 39%. This segment saw revenue growth across the majority of the market sectors in which we operate and benefited from greater levels of short duration projects and service work. The strongest growth was seen within the high-tech manufacturing market sector largely driven by continued demand for our Mechanical Construction and fire protection services by customers engaged in the design, development and production of semiconductors or electric vehicles and lithium batteries. Beyond high-tech manufacturing, we also saw notable increases within network and communications, institutional, manufacturing and industrial, health care and water and wastewater. Demand within this segment continues to be broad-based. As expected, partially offsetting the growth for both of our Construction segments was a decrease in revenues from the commercial market sector due to either reduced demand across the commercial real estate industry or the completion of various warehousing and distribution products, which were active a year ago. Together, our domestic Construction segments generated revenues of $2.5 billion, an increase of just over 31%. Moving to U.S. Building Services. Revenues were $781.1 million, representing a modest increase year-over-year. With revenues increasing $67.2 million or 13%, our Mechanical Services division within this segment continues to benefit from strong demand across its service lines with the most significant growth coming from HVAC projects and retrofits. However, as anticipated and as discussed on prior calls, revenues of the segment were impacted by the nonrenewal of certain contracts within our commercial and government site-based businesses. The loss of these facilities maintenance contracts largely offset the growth within Mechanical Services. Looking at U.S. Industrial Services, revenues were $324 million, increasing just under 11% driven by improved demand across the segment's field services division coupled with greater new build heat exchanger sales within its shop services business. And lastly, U.K. Building Services delivered revenues of $106.6 million, in line with that of the prior year period. If we turn to Slide 6, for the quarter, we reported operating income of $332.8 million or 9.1% of revenues. This compares favorably to operating income of $196.7 million or 6.5% of revenues a year ago. Once again, a more favorable mix of work, exceptional project execution and enhanced productivity due in part to our investments in virtual design construction and prefabrication continue to be key drivers of our improved performance. Looking at our segments. U.S. Electrical Construction reported operating income of $88.6 million, which represents a nearly 75% increase and operating margin of 11.1%, which is a 360 basis point improvement. Increased gross profit and gross profit margin were the primary drivers of this quarter's performance. While the most notable increases were experienced within network and communications, this segment additionally benefited from greater gross profit on projects within the transportation, institutional, high-tech manufacturing and manufacturing and industrial market sectors. Operating income for U.S. Mechanical Construction was $213.4 million, an increase of just over 78%. An operating margin of 12.9% expanded by 290 basis points. This segment experienced greater gross profit from the majority of the market sectors in which we operate with the largest increases being generated within high-tech manufacturing, network and communications and commercial. Together, our Construction segments reported an operating margin of 12.3%. Operating income for U.S. Building Services was $46.8 million or 6% of revenues, in line with the year-ago period. Consistent with the revenue performance of the segment, increased gross profit and gross profit margin from our Mechanical Services division was largely offset by reductions within commercial and government site-based due to the headwinds we previously discussed. Moving to Industrial Services. Operating income was $12.7 million or 3.9% of revenues, representing a nearly 62% increase in operating income and a 120 basis point improvement in operating margin. In addition to the impact of greater revenues, operating income of this segment benefited from higher gross profit margin primarily within the shop services division due to favorable pricing and greater indirect cost absorption. And lastly, U.K. Building Services reported operating income of $5.8 million or 5.4% of revenues, which is relatively consistent with the year-ago period. Let's now turn to Slide 7. A few highlights on this slide not covered by my previous commentary, starting with gross profit. Due to a combination of the revenue growth we just discussed as well as a 260 basis point increase in gross margin, our gross profit of $684 million has increased by nearly 40%. While our SG&A has increased year-over-year, our SG&A margin for the quarter of 9.6% remains consistent with that of the year-ago period. And finally, diluted earnings per share was $5.25 compared to $2.95, an increase of 78%. Briefly turning to Slide 8. This slide outlines EMCOR's performance for the first 6 months of 2024 and has been included here for your reference. Rather than go through our year-to-date results in detail, I wanted to simply highlight that we've had a tremendous start to the year, setting a number of new company records as we continue to deliver for our customers and shareholders. In a later slide, Tony will outline our updated earnings guidance for 2024. And I mention that now as it is this performance which frames our updated guidance. As you can see on the page, we have earned a year-to-date operating margin of 8.3%. This record margin serves as a key data point within our guidance as the midpoint of such range reflects a full year operating margin in line with what we have achieved to date. And finally, on Slide 9, as we've previously stated, our balance sheet remains strong and liquid and continues to be a differentiator for us in the market. Further, the size and strength of our balance sheet, coupled with our significant cash generation, leaves us well positioned to fund organic growth, pursue strategic M&A and return capital to shareholders. In addition to the organic growth we have generated thus far, this is evidenced in part by the $173 million we have spent on acquisitions and $149 million we have utilized for share repurchases year-to-date. Although not shown on this slide, operating cash flow for the quarter was approximately $280 million, which represents 84% of operating income. And on a year-to-date basis, we have generated $412 million of operating cash, equivalent to 70% of operating income. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Tony for a discussion on RPOs.\nAnthony Guzzi: Thanks, Jason. And I'm going to be speaking to Pages 10 and 11, and I'm going to start on Page 10. And on Page 10, you'll see a slide I have referenced before. The format is a little different, and it's really the same slide, as you will see in our new corporate overview presentation that we launched this quarter. This slide highlights some of the key market sectors where we are seeing growth. And in many ways, this chart informs how we allocate resources to drive organic growth. And as I discuss RPOs, if I were you, I would take Slides 10 and 11, put them side by side. And you can follow the discussion with more ease. And then the reality, as I discussed these RPOs, there's no earth-shattering news here. These are the trends we've been seeing at least over the last 8 quarters, and it's how we've set the business up to succeed. So rather than review this slide in detail because it is a continuation of what we've talked about, I'm going to discuss our RPOs as they relate to the 5 key trends outlined on the top of this chart. So if you look at data centers and connectivity, we continue to see strong demand for hyperscale data center work. And we report that in the network and communications market sector. At the end of the quarter, RPOs in the sector were a record $1.7 billion. They're up $489 million or nearly 40% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. We continue to believe that we are not only in the early innings of the overall data center expansion, but that we have successfully positioned ourselves in the key data center geographies. And we expanded our presence in these markets since 2019. Reshoring and near-shoring, coupled with our work in the high-tech manufacturing sector, really cuts across both the high-tech manufacturing sector and the manufacturing industrial sector. In high-tech manufacturing sector, that's where we had RPOs of $1.3 billion at the end of the second quarter. And that includes semiconductors, pharma, biotech, life sciences and the electric vehicle value chain. RPOs in this sector were up $58 million or 5% from the year-ago period. And we continue to believe the long-term fundamentals are solid. As we have stated many times before, we expect ebbs and flows in certain areas of the project award. And as a result, project work within this sector as awards will happen in different amounts and different contract structures once you become on the site, and you're working on a site that has a multiphase and multiyear building program. In addition to high-tech manufacturing, we continue to have a healthy base of ours in the traditional manufacturing industrial market sector. And they totaled $782 million at quarter end. And turn to energy efficiency and sustainability, and that's also ties into short-duration projects, which I'll cover in a little bit. We continue to excel with retrofit project work, especially within the Mechanical Services division of our U.S. Building Services segment, where we saw a year-over-year increase in RPOs of just over 9%. Much of this work is focused on not only retrofit of aged equipment but gaining efficiency with implementing a building automation upgrade coupled with gaining significant efficiency gains with new HVAC equipment. And lastly, on this page, health care is an area we expect to see continued demand with record RPOs at the end of the quarter of $1.2 billion, which is up almost 14% from the year-ago period. Water and wastewater, which now totals $602 million, is up 24% year-over-year. The award of these projects is typically episodic in nature due to the size and scope of the work, and most of our work is predominantly performed in Florida. The institutional sector, which was just over $1.1 billion, up nearly 36% year-over-year. And that includes work for schools, universities and local state and federal office buildings. And what are they spending on? They're spending on research facilities, enhanced and new classroom space, technology upgrades that spread across the campus and renovation and retrofits of -- for improved air quality and a lot of projects to reduce energy consumption. And that's the types of projects that are driving demand in this market sector. Transportation grew about 39% for us, up $276 million, and it's infrastructure awards largely focused around airports. And then short duration projects, again, go back to my energy efficiency comments, they're very much the same. These are electrical upgrades, HVAC upgrades, technology upgrades where you bring more Wi-Fi in and enhancements, building controls upgrades to make the building more efficient, smarter, cleaner and productive. And partially offsetting this increase, we experienced an RPO decrease within commercial. RPOs in this sector now total $1.3 billion. And as a reminder, our exposure in this sector is weighted less towards new construction high-rise and office projects but more towards distribution-type project work and tenant fit-off projects. To conclude my RPO commentary, and as I said earlier, total company RPOs at the end of the second quarter were approximately $9 billion, up $713 million or 8.6% year-over-year. We are pleased with our performance in RPO. We're pleased with the mix in our RPOs, especially considering the strong revenue growth we've had in the second quarter, which reflects a very strong demand for our services. And what you're most worried about, our pipeline remains robust. So now we'll go to Page 12, and I'm going to conclude. With the strong first half performance we had, we are going to raise guidance. We're going to raise our revenue guidance to $14.5 billion to $15 billion. And we're going to increase our earnings per diluted share guidance from $15.50 to $16.50 to $19 to $20. We are seeing incredible execution in the field, and the operating margins in our Construction segments are more resilient and higher than we have experienced in the past or expected at the beginning of the year. We expect these trends to continue with respect to our success in bidding, winning and executing work in favorable market sectors that I've outlined such as network and communications to include data centers, high-tech manufacturing, energy efficiency work, health care and traditional manufacturing and industrial. Further, we expect our U.S. and U.K. Building Services segments continue to perform as outlined in previous calls, and we expect the Industrial Services segment to perform at its highest level post pandemic. We will continue to face challenges in markets, especially in our site-based services business in the U.S. and U.K. Macro factors such as higher interest rates, a presidential election which may slow decision-making, supply chain and energy price disruptions and global conflicts will continue to post challenges for us. But as we have done in the past, we will continue to plan and execute as best we can to overcome these challenges. Also, we remain diligent in how we serve our commercial real estate and private equity customers as high interest rates and scarcity of capital can impact their businesses. Finally, as I always do, I want to thank all of our EMCOR leaders and teammates for their hard work and dedication to serving our customers in a safe and productive way. We have a very talented team here at EMCOR guided by our EMCOR values of Mission First, People Always. And we'll continue to be focused on executing our mission for our customers and shareholders while keeping EMCOR a great place to work for our employees. With that, Danielle, I will take questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson.\nBrent Thielman: Tony, maybe just to start, can you talk about maybe the pipeline of potential opportunities you're still seeing in high-tech and sort of manufacturing and industrial, I think just looking for any other evidence, this sequential reduction in RPOs is more likely temporary and timing related as I think you're ultimately suggesting here.\nAnthony Guzzi: Yes. I mean, look, if you think big picture, right, these are sites that are going to be developed over 10 to 15 years. And so nothing has changed, right? The fabs are moving from Taiwan back to the U.S., so there's near-shoring. There's expanded need for chips because of AI. And all that remains true today just like it did last quarter, the quarter before that, the quarter before that and the quarter before that. We executed at a fairly high burn rate on one of those sites as we hit peak manpower, and we hit peak scope, right? We're at the sweet spot on one of the major sites. And that's a good thing. You could see that in our cash flow, and you can see that in the execution and the drop-through in our mechanical business, especially when you get focused on high tech. So if you go to the semiconductor sector, we're bullish on the sites we're on. We have good line of sight to multiyear projects. But like I've said before, sometimes the multiyear projects now come in different chunks. We're there now. We're working. We're part of the team. We're developing the site. And then sometimes they'll come in, in a different contracting form or they will come back in lump sum. Our job is to make sure we stay as part of that team, execute well, finish the work well, get a commission well and move to the next phase. And most of these sites, the 3 or 4 big ones we're on have 3 or 4 more fabs they're going to build. And it's just not like they jump from one to the other, and everything happens literally. So we feel really good about semiconductors. And nothing's changed in our outlook on pharma and biopharma either. A lot going on. We're in the right places, especially in Research Triangle Park in Indiana and in New Jersey. And these are long-term building programs, again, where you will hit a revenue run rate where we're at now, which is hard to keep up with the RPOs and then again, go back to the contracting mechanism. And reshoring and near-shoring, we show really no change. As far as EVs, I've said this before, we were actually very careful of how we did this. We really led with fire, life safety. The structures are getting built. They're going to continue to get built as they build out a site. The next phase will be equipment and placement. That has slowed down. That was never the biggest part of what we were doing. It was a big part of what we did, like Jason said in the second quarter, but it was never the biggest part of what our high-tech manufacturing exposure has been. And look, I have a personal view. It doesn't really matter whether it's 12%, 15% or 20% or 30%. It's going to be somewhere in there of EV penetration, and then more things will be built. There will be consolidation in that space, and we'll be very careful. We've always been careful how we serve the automotive sector because it is a very episodic-type business. And quite frankly, they're a very difficult customer, and you have to be careful. And then finally, as you go to other near-shoring, we continue to see that as a long-term trend. That trend was happening before COVID. COVID accelerated it, and it continues to be as people look to reshore and expand their supply chains. So that's a long-winded answer to what we're seeing there, but we still are very bullish yet on what's happening in high-tech manufacturing and manufacturing industrial.\nBrent Thielman: That's helpful, Tony. I appreciate that. And then just in terms of the profitability of the company overall, I mean, continue to attain new highs and Tony, just -- you could sort of compare and contrast what is bid margins, what customers are willing to pay to bring you in versus just simple effective execution in the field. It would be helpful to get your -- cover there.\nAnthony Guzzi: Those things are really hard to separate because on these bigger projects, which is really what's driving our margins, most times, we are working in a collaborative way with the customer to be able to fit inside their budget and come up with solutions that work with their budget. So it gets really hard to talk about pricing. I think productivity and our ability to do virtual design and construct and enter earlier in the design phase and do -- and we're not design builders necessarily, but upstream to do engineering assist, which will then compress the time and get the drawings right to begin with. And then to be able to develop a good model that we can all work from and build and not run into the collisions and things you do on the work site and then take that BIM plan and drive it to a very thoughtful prefabrication and supply chain management plan and work with our suppliers, I think my gut, 3/4 of this is coming from productivity and means and methods and planning. And 1/4 of it's coming from price or less because there's too much work going on in productivity. And it's -- or too linked with these customers on the build to think it could be priced. And let's be clear. Nothing's changed in this business as far as and anything we do, there's competition. And these are large sophisticated customers that know how to drive competition to a site.\nBrent Thielman: Yes. Tony, I guess my last question, really kind of just with respect to the -- considering the outlook for rest of 2024. I mean this is just a massive year, potential accomplishment. I know you have a second half to work through just from an earnings perspective. And I appreciate your perspectives on how you think the company can build off of this sort of incredible year provided these kind of end market drivers sustain in the subsequent years.\nAnthony Guzzi: I mean I always think about things, right? I think you know, in general, we're very cautious and conservative, right, by nature. And I think that's why we've had this long-term record of success in what is a pretty difficult business. I think about things maybe a little differently, right, in a sense of you got to put the enablers in place to allow growth, and you got to be positioned with the right customers in the right place. And so the question is, are you continuing to expand the geography you can serve and the sites you can serve? Have you opened up the types of things you can do? An example of that is we continue to look for opportunities to expand the geographies we're in. Our acquisition program in the first part of this year and really over the last number of years forever has been a focus on that. But then you got to think about, okay, I built a capability to do this kind of project in this geography with this subsidiary. Are there other people that have the capability to do that, they do projects that are similar and that it's coming to their geography, can we do a lot of peer learning? Can we have people teach them how to do the project planning upfront? Can they come and learn the means and methods? So I don't know what end demand will ever be, right? We try to position ourselves to markets we think are growing. But I do know if you continue to build capability within your workforce, you continue to build capability in the number of markets you can serve. And if you continue to train your leaders the right way and how you treat people and how you lead and how you plan and you do those things right, then long term, you can build on success. And I think that's the playbook we've been following for a while. I think we're in a period now that, obviously, it's accelerated over these past 3 years. But I think a lot of that is investments that we made 5, 10 years ago to continue to build that workforce and build the culture that we have that allows for transparency, that allows for teamwork, that allows for respect and share ideas across our company. And then you couple that with a strong focus on discipline and disciplined execution and then you always keep safety of your workforce and your planning in paramount, I think you get good results. And you position yourself well with key customers, you can grow with them as they expand what they're doing.\nOperator: The next question comes from Adam Thalhimer from Thompson, Davis.\nAdam Thalhimer: Also congrats on a great quarter. Tony, is the headwind you talked about within commercial, is that coming in any different than you anticipated?\nAnthony Guzzi: No, I think we'd say -- and Jason, maybe you can elaborate on this and put some context on it, it's exactly where we thought it would be. And quite frankly, we might have had this decline even if the commercial market was strong because we would have pivoted our resources to some of the high-tech manufacturing and traditional manufacturing anyway because it's longer-term, larger projects, more difficult projects, which is right in our wheelhouse, especially on the fire and life safety side. So we would have -- not that we have a shortage of workforce, but we would have pivoted some of that workforce to a more lucrative market anyway. Jason, you got...\nJason Nalbandian: Tony, I would agree with that. I think right on the commercial side, it is the only market sector where on a quarter-to-date basis, we are down on the Construction side. It's exactly what we expected, both electrically and mechanically. And as Tony said before, we've pivoted ourselves elsewhere where we are seeing growth. And then on commercial, if the question is specific to commercial site based where we've talked about the headwinds there, it's exactly the contracts that we spoke about at the end of December. The revenue decline there is exactly what we anticipated. And Building Services is operating collectively as a segment right where we thought it would be, right, the growth in the quarter being 1% and on a year-to-date basis at 4%.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. And then presumably, you're running pretty flat out. I assume you guys are fully engaged. You're probably having some labor availability issues, if anything. I mean have you guys been turning away work? Or how have you been managing backlog?\nAnthony Guzzi: We -- look, let's think about business in general, right? These are massive markets even when times aren't as bullish as they are now. When you run a company like ours and you're running it at the subsidiary level, you're always focused on what's the best opportunities in the market I have for the capabilities I have, and how am I going to deploy those resources. And you do it 2 different ways, right? You think about those that you're going to deploy over a 1-year or 2-year horizon on a set of projects and opportunities. But you also keep running at a more routine stuff, the short duration projects, and you keep that alive in the market. And we're blessed here at EMCOR is our team, our subsidiary CEOs, I would say, with the guidance of the segment folks, are masters at thinking about how you take the resource and deployment in the most effective way possible. You'd always say -- I've never been one to say, \"Oh, we're turning away all kind of work, we're doing this or that\" because I don't believe that's what we actually do. I think we say, \"This is the team we're playing with. This is what we have. This is how we're building workforce capability.\" And we're going to grow 2 ways. Either we can do more projects because we build more capability with foreman and superintendent to that or the size of the projects going up in some cases, and that multiyear opportunity and that person can run bigger work over a longer time period. So I don't think we're labor short. We're always looking for great labor. We have great labor. I think, though, that if you have a metering, it's not around the actual labor, the journeyman, the apprentices and the wireman and those folks. The labor shortages, if you're going to have any, it's about your workforce development over time would be in the foreman, the project managers, the project executives and the skilled estimating resources you have, and we're always developing those. So it very much is a how you're going to manage the mix in your local geography and how we're going to manage the mix across EMCOR.\nAdam Thalhimer: And then, Tony, how do you think about your potential to grow margins from here? I've been looking at EMCOR for about as long as you've been CEO. And I mean it's just amazing the productivity and the margins you guys are generating.\nAnthony Guzzi: Yes. A lot of stuff has got to come together, and it has been coming together. You got to start with all those things we've talked about: workforce development, investments in technology, best practice sharing. It echoes across from estimating, mix management, means and methods, virtual design and construct, BIM, supply chain management. I mean you really have to take your -- what you're doing well and then spread that through the company, and that's one way to get margin. The second thing is we're in a tough business. And so absence of badness is a big deal. And so we've invested and trained our folks pretty strongly on contract negotiations. And when it's a more difficult negotiation, we've enhanced our legal capability to be able to respond and be thoughtful. And then when we do run into a problem, like not everything is perfect all the time, we're prepared for that dispute with facts and adherence to the contract so we can get a better result than we may have gotten 5, 8 years ago. And then I think the other thing is you got to have good markets where you get good absorption in and you're working alongside the customer to get a good result. And where do margins go from here? I mean, obviously, we believe for the rest of the year, they're about the same as you go to -- right, Jason?\nJason Nalbandian: Yes. If you look at the guidance, really what we've assumed there, and I touched on the midpoint, right, which is if you look at the midpoint of our guidance, we're saying we can repeat in the back half of the year what we've done through the first 6 months of the year. When you look at those, the low end of the guidance, we're essentially saying we believe that at the low end, we can achieve the record margins that we achieved in the back half of last year. And if you look at the high end, we're essentially assuming 30 to 40 basis points above where we're at today.\nOperator: The next question comes from Alex Dwyer from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAlexander Dwyer: Can you talk about which geographies in the country you are seeing the highest growth right now? And would there be any other like geographies that you'd call out as being weaker versus stronger right now?\nAnthony Guzzi: It's fairly broad-based in the markets that we're in. So -- but if you go to where the real growth is coming from, I think you'd have to say Texas, specifically around high-tech manufacturing and data centers. I think the Midwest has been fairly strong for us, and that's driven by auto, data centers and just general construction across the Midwest and even still some cold storage and things like that. I think Arizona has been very strong for us, as you'd expect. The Mid-Atlantic has been very strong for us. New York City, sort of flattish. Again, we're mainly an aftermarket company in New York City now, [indiscernible] company. I think Boston has slowed a little bit. It's more flat, but it's up yet from where it was 5 years ago, but it's slowed a little bit. I mean some of the R&D facilities they were building have slowed. They were doing that sort of hotel concept around lab space. That certainly slowed. California has been okay, and energy retrofit work in California has been pretty strong. Some of the health care work in California has been pretty strong. Oregon, Washington continues to be strong, especially around data centers. Salt Lake's up, I mean, maybe not as strong as Arizona and other places, but still up. So it's pretty broad-based. I would say sort of the Northeast is sort of flattish, again, going back. The rest of the country, I think, is doing pretty well. Jason?\nJason Nalbandian: I think you hit on it all, Tony.\nAnthony Guzzi: I'd add Georgia and North Carolina. They're very strong for us right now.\nAlexander Dwyer: Got it. That's super helpful. And then just lastly, with the $800 million of cash on the balance sheet, no debt, how should we be thinking about M&A versus repurchases as we go to the second half of the year? Like should we expect the M&A program to be concentrated more and looking after those high-tech manufacturing and data center end markets? And then is there any change in the M&A pipeline at all?\nAnthony Guzzi: Yes. We have a good pipeline. Deals happen when they happen. I would expect right now, I mean, obviously, we're not afraid of doing $0.5 billion or $1 billion deal. But right now, what we're looking at is more of the same of what we did here in the first half of the year, which we're very pleased with. Our M&A execution over the last 5 years has been superb. And those who have known me over a long period of time, I think M&A is very difficult. I think we've been a good B+, A- student for a while here. The size of the deal goes up, the execution risk gets a lot harder. But so far, we've executed well. We have a good pipeline. Jason, I'd turn it over to you. I think we're going to continue to return cash to shareholders, and we're going to continue to grow the company through M&A and organic growth.\nJason Nalbandian: Yes. I think overall, right, no real change in strategy here. I think we'll continue to be balanced capital allocators. As Tony said, we're pleased with what we did through the first half of the year, right? We generated $412 million of operating cash, but our cash balances remain largely unchanged from the end of 2023. And that's the acquisitions at $173 million, the share repurchases at $149 million, our CapEx and our dividends. And in the back of our slide deck, I think it's Slide 13, we've updated our historical capital allocation here. If you look where we are so far this year, it's weighted 45% to shareholder return and 55% to business reinvestment. And if you look over time, we're closer to 50-50, and we'll continue to strive for that over time. So I think a long-winded way to say the back half of the year should look very similar to the first half.\nAnthony Guzzi: I mean I think I've always been a proponent you don't force M&A. I think you -- some of the things we did here in the first half of the year, we've been talking to those people for 3 years. Some of the things we'll do a year from now, we've been talking to them for 3 years. I mean we are so focused on making sure we have a good cultural fit. We'll get the numbers right, right? If the cultural fits right, we're usually talking to a really good company that shares our values. What we won't do -- and also it's something we believe we can grow. And it's something that adds capability to us. What we won't do is play the multiple game, right? We're not out there trying to say, well, we're at X, and we can buy whatever is out there for a much -- 7 to 10, and therefore, we're creating value. That never works out well, especially -- and maybe it works out well for the PE guys. But I can promise you that doesn't work out well as an operating company because we own them forever, and we've got to build the businesses and they got to culturally fit. So we're much more focused on that than anything else. And you can see the fruits of our M&A work today in our numbers from deals we made 15, 16, 10, 12 years ago. And we really haven't wavered from that and has paid significant dividends for us. We start with management. If we don't believe the management has the skill and character and all the things and the competency that we all think is important, we won't buy the company because even if you can replace management, if those things aren't evident in the company, that bleeds through the entire company that create nothing but problems for us.\nAlexander Dwyer: Got it. Okay. Can I squeeze one more in? For the data center build, is it possible to like parse through how much of the data center builds you're working on is just coming from traditional type data center builds we've seen over the past 5 years with the cloud? Or how much is coming from these new AI-type data centers?\nAnthony Guzzi: We wouldn't have that kind of visibility. We just know that it's expanded. The only thing you could parse through is maybe the power requirements have gone up, but they were going up anyway. Ultimately, we'll build a data center. We'll energize the racking. We'll do day 2 work. What's actually going on in there, we don't have a lot of visibility to post once we build it. Even if we're doing some of the maintenance there, we don't have a lot of visibility on what the customers are using for. I thought where you headed the developers versus the 5 or 6 owners to build them, and there, there's really no difference, right? In the end of the day, those people are building them for the 5 or 6 people that would be building the data centers.\nOperator: Mr. Guzzi, we have no further questions. I would like to turn it back to you for closing remarks.\nAnthony Guzzi: Sure. I'm just going to tell you, thank you. I appreciate your interest in EMCOR. And be safe. With that, I'll turn it over to Andy to close us off here.\nAndrew Backman: Thanks, Tony. Thanks, Jason and Maxine, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. If you should have any follow-up questions, please do not hesitate to reach out directly. Thank you all again, and have a great day. Danielle, would you please close the call?\nOperator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Anthony Guzzi",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Andy, and good morning, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call. I am going to begin my discussion on Page 4. We had an exceptional first half of the year at EMCOR, and our results for the second quarter of 2024 further illustrate our continued momentum and excellent execution in the field. Within the quarter, we set new quarterly records for revenues, operating income, operating margin and diluted earnings per share. We grew revenues by 20.4% to $3.67 billion, achieved a consolidated operating margin of 9.1% and earned $5.25 per diluted share. While revenues increased 17.7% organically, RPOs of $9 billion remained at near record levels, increasing $713 million or 8.6% versus the year-ago period. Our Mechanical and Electrical Construction segments are driving our record performance with organic revenue growth in both the quarter and year-to-date periods of over 33% in our Mechanical Construction segment and 18% in our Electrical Construction segment. We continue to be well positioned in the right geographies and market sectors. We are winning the right mix of work, estimating our opportunities with the appropriate contingency, negotiating our contracts with care, planning with discipline and executing our work with precision and innovation with year-to-date operating margins of 11.8% for Mechanical Construction and 11.5% for Electrical Construction. We continue to perform well in large and growing market sectors with strong demand anchored in favorable markets for which that includes high-tech and traditional manufacturing; network and communications, which includes data centers, institutional and health care that are benefiting from long-term secular trends. Our teams are executing with discipline and precision aided by the full range of virtual design and construction tools, we call that VDC. And that also includes BIM, which you've heard me talk about, building information modeling, as well as excellent prefabrication, fill planning, supply chain management and contract negotiation. These teams continue to focus on delivering impressive results for our customers on incredibly sophisticated and fast-paced projects with multiyear building plans. When we target these large sophisticated sites, we typically win 25% to 35% of the time. However, it is always important to remember, and I had said this on many of these calls, after the initial project award, future phases may be released in smaller increments potentially affect the timing and amount we recognize within our RPOs even if the cumulative revenue from these subsequent phases is equivalent to the initial award that we previously had in RPOs. This is partially reflected in the 2% decline in RPOs from the first quarter of 2024. Beyond our Construction segments, our U.S. Building Services segment is executing as we expected. Our Mechanical Services business is operating in high single-digit operating margins and is growing revenues at low double digits. We are experiencing strength in all our Mechanical Service lines, including repair service, service agreements, retrofit HVAC projects and building controls, installations and upgrades. However, as we discussed in our year-end 2023 call, on an annual basis, we have had nearly $300 million in revenue headwinds in our commercial site-based business due to the loss of certain facilities, maintenance contracts are rebid despite strong customer scores on our service delivery. Despite these headwinds, we still delivered quarterly and year-to-date operating margins of 6% and 5% in the U.S. Building Services segment. And revenues grew about as expected by 4.1% year-to-date. Our Industrial Services segment reported its best second quarter post pandemic. And we saw improved demand for both our shop and field services on both the quarterly and year-to-date basis. Our shops continue to perform well, and the Electrical business within this segment has experienced increased demand, both from traditional upstream and midstream customers as well as for certain renewable fuels projects. Our U.K. business continues to perform as expected and has had some success in building its pipeline and retooling its business development efforts. This segment had solid operating margins at 5.4% in the quarter and 5.3% on a year-to-date basis. We had strong operating cash flow of $412 million on a year-to-date basis, almost double from the year-ago period. As I have said, our RPOs remain at near-record levels at $9.0 billion, and I will discuss our -- that in more detail later, and our prospects remain strong. We successfully closed 4 acquisitions in the quarter for an aggregate upfront purchase price of $173 million net of cash acquired. These acquisitions bolster our Mechanical Construction, Building Services and our Industrial Services segment. With that opening, Jason, I'll turn it over to you. Thanks, Jason. And I'm going to be speaking to Pages 10 and 11, and I'm going to start on Page 10. And on Page 10, you'll see a slide I have referenced before. The format is a little different, and it's really the same slide, as you will see in our new corporate overview presentation that we launched this quarter. This slide highlights some of the key market sectors where we are seeing growth. And in many ways, this chart informs how we allocate resources to drive organic growth. And as I discuss RPOs, if I were you, I would take Slides 10 and 11, put them side by side. And you can follow the discussion with more ease. And then the reality, as I discussed these RPOs, there's no earth-shattering news here. These are the trends we've been seeing at least over the last 8 quarters, and it's how we've set the business up to succeed. So rather than review this slide in detail because it is a continuation of what we've talked about, I'm going to discuss our RPOs as they relate to the 5 key trends outlined on the top of this chart. So if you look at data centers and connectivity, we continue to see strong demand for hyperscale data center work. And we report that in the network and communications market sector. At the end of the quarter, RPOs in the sector were a record $1.7 billion. They're up $489 million or nearly 40% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. We continue to believe that we are not only in the early innings of the overall data center expansion, but that we have successfully positioned ourselves in the key data center geographies. And we expanded our presence in these markets since 2019. Reshoring and near-shoring, coupled with our work in the high-tech manufacturing sector, really cuts across both the high-tech manufacturing sector and the manufacturing industrial sector. In high-tech manufacturing sector, that's where we had RPOs of $1.3 billion at the end of the second quarter. And that includes semiconductors, pharma, biotech, life sciences and the electric vehicle value chain. RPOs in this sector were up $58 million or 5% from the year-ago period. And we continue to believe the long-term fundamentals are solid. As we have stated many times before, we expect ebbs and flows in certain areas of the project award. And as a result, project work within this sector as awards will happen in different amounts and different contract structures once you become on the site, and you're working on a site that has a multiphase and multiyear building program. In addition to high-tech manufacturing, we continue to have a healthy base of ours in the traditional manufacturing industrial market sector. And they totaled $782 million at quarter end. And turn to energy efficiency and sustainability, and that's also ties into short-duration projects, which I'll cover in a little bit. We continue to excel with retrofit project work, especially within the Mechanical Services division of our U.S. Building Services segment, where we saw a year-over-year increase in RPOs of just over 9%. Much of this work is focused on not only retrofit of aged equipment but gaining efficiency with implementing a building automation upgrade coupled with gaining significant efficiency gains with new HVAC equipment. And lastly, on this page, health care is an area we expect to see continued demand with record RPOs at the end of the quarter of $1.2 billion, which is up almost 14% from the year-ago period. Water and wastewater, which now totals $602 million, is up 24% year-over-year. The award of these projects is typically episodic in nature due to the size and scope of the work, and most of our work is predominantly performed in Florida. The institutional sector, which was just over $1.1 billion, up nearly 36% year-over-year. And that includes work for schools, universities and local state and federal office buildings. And what are they spending on? They're spending on research facilities, enhanced and new classroom space, technology upgrades that spread across the campus and renovation and retrofits of -- for improved air quality and a lot of projects to reduce energy consumption. And that's the types of projects that are driving demand in this market sector. Transportation grew about 39% for us, up $276 million, and it's infrastructure awards largely focused around airports. And then short duration projects, again, go back to my energy efficiency comments, they're very much the same. These are electrical upgrades, HVAC upgrades, technology upgrades where you bring more Wi-Fi in and enhancements, building controls upgrades to make the building more efficient, smarter, cleaner and productive. And partially offsetting this increase, we experienced an RPO decrease within commercial. RPOs in this sector now total $1.3 billion. And as a reminder, our exposure in this sector is weighted less towards new construction high-rise and office projects but more towards distribution-type project work and tenant fit-off projects. To conclude my RPO commentary, and as I said earlier, total company RPOs at the end of the second quarter were approximately $9 billion, up $713 million or 8.6% year-over-year. We are pleased with our performance in RPO. We're pleased with the mix in our RPOs, especially considering the strong revenue growth we've had in the second quarter, which reflects a very strong demand for our services. And what you're most worried about, our pipeline remains robust. So now we'll go to Page 12, and I'm going to conclude. With the strong first half performance we had, we are going to raise guidance. We're going to raise our revenue guidance to $14.5 billion to $15 billion. And we're going to increase our earnings per diluted share guidance from $15.50 to $16.50 to $19 to $20. We are seeing incredible execution in the field, and the operating margins in our Construction segments are more resilient and higher than we have experienced in the past or expected at the beginning of the year. We expect these trends to continue with respect to our success in bidding, winning and executing work in favorable market sectors that I've outlined such as network and communications to include data centers, high-tech manufacturing, energy efficiency work, health care and traditional manufacturing and industrial. Further, we expect our U.S. and U.K. Building Services segments continue to perform as outlined in previous calls, and we expect the Industrial Services segment to perform at its highest level post pandemic. We will continue to face challenges in markets, especially in our site-based services business in the U.S. and U.K. Macro factors such as higher interest rates, a presidential election which may slow decision-making, supply chain and energy price disruptions and global conflicts will continue to post challenges for us. But as we have done in the past, we will continue to plan and execute as best we can to overcome these challenges. Also, we remain diligent in how we serve our commercial real estate and private equity customers as high interest rates and scarcity of capital can impact their businesses. Finally, as I always do, I want to thank all of our EMCOR leaders and teammates for their hard work and dedication to serving our customers in a safe and productive way. We have a very talented team here at EMCOR guided by our EMCOR values of Mission First, People Always. And we'll continue to be focused on executing our mission for our customers and shareholders while keeping EMCOR a great place to work for our employees. With that, Danielle, I will take questions? Yes. I mean, look, if you think big picture, right, these are sites that are going to be developed over 10 to 15 years. And so nothing has changed, right? The fabs are moving from Taiwan back to the U.S., so there's near-shoring. There's expanded need for chips because of AI. And all that remains true today just like it did last quarter, the quarter before that, the quarter before that and the quarter before that. We executed at a fairly high burn rate on one of those sites as we hit peak manpower, and we hit peak scope, right? We're at the sweet spot on one of the major sites. And that's a good thing. You could see that in our cash flow, and you can see that in the execution and the drop-through in our mechanical business, especially when you get focused on high tech. So if you go to the semiconductor sector, we're bullish on the sites we're on. We have good line of sight to multiyear projects. But like I've said before, sometimes the multiyear projects now come in different chunks. We're there now. We're working. We're part of the team. We're developing the site. And then sometimes they'll come in, in a different contracting form or they will come back in lump sum. Our job is to make sure we stay as part of that team, execute well, finish the work well, get a commission well and move to the next phase. And most of these sites, the 3 or 4 big ones we're on have 3 or 4 more fabs they're going to build. And it's just not like they jump from one to the other, and everything happens literally. So we feel really good about semiconductors. And nothing's changed in our outlook on pharma and biopharma either. A lot going on. We're in the right places, especially in Research Triangle Park in Indiana and in New Jersey. And these are long-term building programs, again, where you will hit a revenue run rate where we're at now, which is hard to keep up with the RPOs and then again, go back to the contracting mechanism. And reshoring and near-shoring, we show really no change. As far as EVs, I've said this before, we were actually very careful of how we did this. We really led with fire, life safety. The structures are getting built. They're going to continue to get built as they build out a site. The next phase will be equipment and placement. That has slowed down. That was never the biggest part of what we were doing. It was a big part of what we did, like Jason said in the second quarter, but it was never the biggest part of what our high-tech manufacturing exposure has been. And look, I have a personal view. It doesn't really matter whether it's 12%, 15% or 20% or 30%. It's going to be somewhere in there of EV penetration, and then more things will be built. There will be consolidation in that space, and we'll be very careful. We've always been careful how we serve the automotive sector because it is a very episodic-type business. And quite frankly, they're a very difficult customer, and you have to be careful. And then finally, as you go to other near-shoring, we continue to see that as a long-term trend. That trend was happening before COVID. COVID accelerated it, and it continues to be as people look to reshore and expand their supply chains. So that's a long-winded answer to what we're seeing there, but we still are very bullish yet on what's happening in high-tech manufacturing and manufacturing industrial. Those things are really hard to separate because on these bigger projects, which is really what's driving our margins, most times, we are working in a collaborative way with the customer to be able to fit inside their budget and come up with solutions that work with their budget. So it gets really hard to talk about pricing. I think productivity and our ability to do virtual design and construct and enter earlier in the design phase and do -- and we're not design builders necessarily, but upstream to do engineering assist, which will then compress the time and get the drawings right to begin with. And then to be able to develop a good model that we can all work from and build and not run into the collisions and things you do on the work site and then take that BIM plan and drive it to a very thoughtful prefabrication and supply chain management plan and work with our suppliers, I think my gut, 3/4 of this is coming from productivity and means and methods and planning. And 1/4 of it's coming from price or less because there's too much work going on in productivity. And it's -- or too linked with these customers on the build to think it could be priced. And let's be clear. Nothing's changed in this business as far as and anything we do, there's competition. And these are large sophisticated customers that know how to drive competition to a site. I mean I always think about things, right? I think you know, in general, we're very cautious and conservative, right, by nature. And I think that's why we've had this long-term record of success in what is a pretty difficult business. I think about things maybe a little differently, right, in a sense of you got to put the enablers in place to allow growth, and you got to be positioned with the right customers in the right place. And so the question is, are you continuing to expand the geography you can serve and the sites you can serve? Have you opened up the types of things you can do? An example of that is we continue to look for opportunities to expand the geographies we're in. Our acquisition program in the first part of this year and really over the last number of years forever has been a focus on that. But then you got to think about, okay, I built a capability to do this kind of project in this geography with this subsidiary. Are there other people that have the capability to do that, they do projects that are similar and that it's coming to their geography, can we do a lot of peer learning? Can we have people teach them how to do the project planning upfront? Can they come and learn the means and methods? So I don't know what end demand will ever be, right? We try to position ourselves to markets we think are growing. But I do know if you continue to build capability within your workforce, you continue to build capability in the number of markets you can serve. And if you continue to train your leaders the right way and how you treat people and how you lead and how you plan and you do those things right, then long term, you can build on success. And I think that's the playbook we've been following for a while. I think we're in a period now that, obviously, it's accelerated over these past 3 years. But I think a lot of that is investments that we made 5, 10 years ago to continue to build that workforce and build the culture that we have that allows for transparency, that allows for teamwork, that allows for respect and share ideas across our company. And then you couple that with a strong focus on discipline and disciplined execution and then you always keep safety of your workforce and your planning in paramount, I think you get good results. And you position yourself well with key customers, you can grow with them as they expand what they're doing. No, I think we'd say -- and Jason, maybe you can elaborate on this and put some context on it, it's exactly where we thought it would be. And quite frankly, we might have had this decline even if the commercial market was strong because we would have pivoted our resources to some of the high-tech manufacturing and traditional manufacturing anyway because it's longer-term, larger projects, more difficult projects, which is right in our wheelhouse, especially on the fire and life safety side. So we would have -- not that we have a shortage of workforce, but we would have pivoted some of that workforce to a more lucrative market anyway. Jason, you got... We -- look, let's think about business in general, right? These are massive markets even when times aren't as bullish as they are now. When you run a company like ours and you're running it at the subsidiary level, you're always focused on what's the best opportunities in the market I have for the capabilities I have, and how am I going to deploy those resources. And you do it 2 different ways, right? You think about those that you're going to deploy over a 1-year or 2-year horizon on a set of projects and opportunities. But you also keep running at a more routine stuff, the short duration projects, and you keep that alive in the market. And we're blessed here at EMCOR is our team, our subsidiary CEOs, I would say, with the guidance of the segment folks, are masters at thinking about how you take the resource and deployment in the most effective way possible. You'd always say -- I've never been one to say, \"Oh, we're turning away all kind of work, we're doing this or that\" because I don't believe that's what we actually do. I think we say, \"This is the team we're playing with. This is what we have. This is how we're building workforce capability.\" And we're going to grow 2 ways. Either we can do more projects because we build more capability with foreman and superintendent to that or the size of the projects going up in some cases, and that multiyear opportunity and that person can run bigger work over a longer time period. So I don't think we're labor short. We're always looking for great labor. We have great labor. I think, though, that if you have a metering, it's not around the actual labor, the journeyman, the apprentices and the wireman and those folks. The labor shortages, if you're going to have any, it's about your workforce development over time would be in the foreman, the project managers, the project executives and the skilled estimating resources you have, and we're always developing those. So it very much is a how you're going to manage the mix in your local geography and how we're going to manage the mix across EMCOR. Yes. A lot of stuff has got to come together, and it has been coming together. You got to start with all those things we've talked about: workforce development, investments in technology, best practice sharing. It echoes across from estimating, mix management, means and methods, virtual design and construct, BIM, supply chain management. I mean you really have to take your -- what you're doing well and then spread that through the company, and that's one way to get margin. The second thing is we're in a tough business. And so absence of badness is a big deal. And so we've invested and trained our folks pretty strongly on contract negotiations. And when it's a more difficult negotiation, we've enhanced our legal capability to be able to respond and be thoughtful. And then when we do run into a problem, like not everything is perfect all the time, we're prepared for that dispute with facts and adherence to the contract so we can get a better result than we may have gotten 5, 8 years ago. And then I think the other thing is you got to have good markets where you get good absorption in and you're working alongside the customer to get a good result. And where do margins go from here? I mean, obviously, we believe for the rest of the year, they're about the same as you go to -- right, Jason? It's fairly broad-based in the markets that we're in. So -- but if you go to where the real growth is coming from, I think you'd have to say Texas, specifically around high-tech manufacturing and data centers. I think the Midwest has been fairly strong for us, and that's driven by auto, data centers and just general construction across the Midwest and even still some cold storage and things like that. I think Arizona has been very strong for us, as you'd expect. The Mid-Atlantic has been very strong for us. New York City, sort of flattish. Again, we're mainly an aftermarket company in New York City now, [indiscernible] company. I think Boston has slowed a little bit. It's more flat, but it's up yet from where it was 5 years ago, but it's slowed a little bit. I mean some of the R&D facilities they were building have slowed. They were doing that sort of hotel concept around lab space. That certainly slowed. California has been okay, and energy retrofit work in California has been pretty strong. Some of the health care work in California has been pretty strong. Oregon, Washington continues to be strong, especially around data centers. Salt Lake's up, I mean, maybe not as strong as Arizona and other places, but still up. So it's pretty broad-based. I would say sort of the Northeast is sort of flattish, again, going back. The rest of the country, I think, is doing pretty well. Jason? I'd add Georgia and North Carolina. They're very strong for us right now. Yes. We have a good pipeline. Deals happen when they happen. I would expect right now, I mean, obviously, we're not afraid of doing $0.5 billion or $1 billion deal. But right now, what we're looking at is more of the same of what we did here in the first half of the year, which we're very pleased with. Our M&A execution over the last 5 years has been superb. And those who have known me over a long period of time, I think M&A is very difficult. I think we've been a good B+, A- student for a while here. The size of the deal goes up, the execution risk gets a lot harder. But so far, we've executed well. We have a good pipeline. Jason, I'd turn it over to you. I think we're going to continue to return cash to shareholders, and we're going to continue to grow the company through M&A and organic growth. I mean I think I've always been a proponent you don't force M&A. I think you -- some of the things we did here in the first half of the year, we've been talking to those people for 3 years. Some of the things we'll do a year from now, we've been talking to them for 3 years. I mean we are so focused on making sure we have a good cultural fit. We'll get the numbers right, right? If the cultural fits right, we're usually talking to a really good company that shares our values. What we won't do -- and also it's something we believe we can grow. And it's something that adds capability to us. What we won't do is play the multiple game, right? We're not out there trying to say, well, we're at X, and we can buy whatever is out there for a much -- 7 to 10, and therefore, we're creating value. That never works out well, especially -- and maybe it works out well for the PE guys. But I can promise you that doesn't work out well as an operating company because we own them forever, and we've got to build the businesses and they got to culturally fit. So we're much more focused on that than anything else. And you can see the fruits of our M&A work today in our numbers from deals we made 15, 16, 10, 12 years ago. And we really haven't wavered from that and has paid significant dividends for us. We start with management. If we don't believe the management has the skill and character and all the things and the competency that we all think is important, we won't buy the company because even if you can replace management, if those things aren't evident in the company, that bleeds through the entire company that create nothing but problems for us. We wouldn't have that kind of visibility. We just know that it's expanded. The only thing you could parse through is maybe the power requirements have gone up, but they were going up anyway. Ultimately, we'll build a data center. We'll energize the racking. We'll do day 2 work. What's actually going on in there, we don't have a lot of visibility to post once we build it. Even if we're doing some of the maintenance there, we don't have a lot of visibility on what the customers are using for. I thought where you headed the developers versus the 5 or 6 owners to build them, and there, there's really no difference, right? In the end of the day, those people are building them for the 5 or 6 people that would be building the data centers. Sure. I'm just going to tell you, thank you. I appreciate your interest in EMCOR. And be safe. With that, I'll turn it over to Andy to close us off here."

            "content": "Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Over the next several slides, I will review the operating performance of each of our segments as well as some of the key financial data for the second quarter of 2024 as compared to the second quarter of 2023. I'm going to start on Slide 5 with revenues. As Tony mentioned, consolidated revenues were $3.67 billion, an increase of $621.3 million or 20.4% as demand for our services continues to be strong across the majority of the market sectors we serve. Each of our reportable segments experienced year-over-year increases in revenues, and we achieved organic revenue growth of nearly 18%. Looking at each of our segments. Revenues of U.S. Electrical Construction were $800 million, an increase of 18%. This segment continues to benefit from increased demand across many market sectors with the most significant revenue growth once again coming from network and communications, which, as a reminder, is predominantly our data center projects. In addition, this segment experienced increases in revenues within the transportation, high-tech manufacturing and manufacturing and industrial market sectors. Revenues for U.S. Mechanical Construction were $1.7 billion, increasing nearly 39%. This segment saw revenue growth across the majority of the market sectors in which we operate and benefited from greater levels of short duration projects and service work. The strongest growth was seen within the high-tech manufacturing market sector largely driven by continued demand for our Mechanical Construction and fire protection services by customers engaged in the design, development and production of semiconductors or electric vehicles and lithium batteries. Beyond high-tech manufacturing, we also saw notable increases within network and communications, institutional, manufacturing and industrial, health care and water and wastewater. Demand within this segment continues to be broad-based. As expected, partially offsetting the growth for both of our Construction segments was a decrease in revenues from the commercial market sector due to either reduced demand across the commercial real estate industry or the completion of various warehousing and distribution products, which were active a year ago. Together, our domestic Construction segments generated revenues of $2.5 billion, an increase of just over 31%. Moving to U.S. Building Services. Revenues were $781.1 million, representing a modest increase year-over-year. With revenues increasing $67.2 million or 13%, our Mechanical Services division within this segment continues to benefit from strong demand across its service lines with the most significant growth coming from HVAC projects and retrofits. However, as anticipated and as discussed on prior calls, revenues of the segment were impacted by the nonrenewal of certain contracts within our commercial and government site-based businesses. The loss of these facilities maintenance contracts largely offset the growth within Mechanical Services. Looking at U.S. Industrial Services, revenues were $324 million, increasing just under 11% driven by improved demand across the segment's field services division coupled with greater new build heat exchanger sales within its shop services business. And lastly, U.K. Building Services delivered revenues of $106.6 million, in line with that of the prior year period. If we turn to Slide 6, for the quarter, we reported operating income of $332.8 million or 9.1% of revenues. This compares favorably to operating income of $196.7 million or 6.5% of revenues a year ago. Once again, a more favorable mix of work, exceptional project execution and enhanced productivity due in part to our investments in virtual design construction and prefabrication continue to be key drivers of our improved performance. Looking at our segments. U.S. Electrical Construction reported operating income of $88.6 million, which represents a nearly 75% increase and operating margin of 11.1%, which is a 360 basis point improvement. Increased gross profit and gross profit margin were the primary drivers of this quarter's performance. While the most notable increases were experienced within network and communications, this segment additionally benefited from greater gross profit on projects within the transportation, institutional, high-tech manufacturing and manufacturing and industrial market sectors. Operating income for U.S. Mechanical Construction was $213.4 million, an increase of just over 78%. An operating margin of 12.9% expanded by 290 basis points. This segment experienced greater gross profit from the majority of the market sectors in which we operate with the largest increases being generated within high-tech manufacturing, network and communications and commercial. Together, our Construction segments reported an operating margin of 12.3%. Operating income for U.S. Building Services was $46.8 million or 6% of revenues, in line with the year-ago period. Consistent with the revenue performance of the segment, increased gross profit and gross profit margin from our Mechanical Services division was largely offset by reductions within commercial and government site-based due to the headwinds we previously discussed. Moving to Industrial Services. Operating income was $12.7 million or 3.9% of revenues, representing a nearly 62% increase in operating income and a 120 basis point improvement in operating margin. In addition to the impact of greater revenues, operating income of this segment benefited from higher gross profit margin primarily within the shop services division due to favorable pricing and greater indirect cost absorption. And lastly, U.K. Building Services reported operating income of $5.8 million or 5.4% of revenues, which is relatively consistent with the year-ago period. Let's now turn to Slide 7. A few highlights on this slide not covered by my previous commentary, starting with gross profit. Due to a combination of the revenue growth we just discussed as well as a 260 basis point increase in gross margin, our gross profit of $684 million has increased by nearly 40%. While our SG&A has increased year-over-year, our SG&A margin for the quarter of 9.6% remains consistent with that of the year-ago period. And finally, diluted earnings per share was $5.25 compared to $2.95, an increase of 78%. Briefly turning to Slide 8. This slide outlines EMCOR's performance for the first 6 months of 2024 and has been included here for your reference. Rather than go through our year-to-date results in detail, I wanted to simply highlight that we've had a tremendous start to the year, setting a number of new company records as we continue to deliver for our customers and shareholders. In a later slide, Tony will outline our updated earnings guidance for 2024. And I mention that now as it is this performance which frames our updated guidance. As you can see on the page, we have earned a year-to-date operating margin of 8.3%. This record margin serves as a key data point within our guidance as the midpoint of such range reflects a full year operating margin in line with what we have achieved to date. And finally, on Slide 9, as we've previously stated, our balance sheet remains strong and liquid and continues to be a differentiator for us in the market. Further, the size and strength of our balance sheet, coupled with our significant cash generation, leaves us well positioned to fund organic growth, pursue strategic M&A and return capital to shareholders. In addition to the organic growth we have generated thus far, this is evidenced in part by the $173 million we have spent on acquisitions and $149 million we have utilized for share repurchases year-to-date. Although not shown on this slide, operating cash flow for the quarter was approximately $280 million, which represents 84% of operating income. And on a year-to-date basis, we have generated $412 million of operating cash, equivalent to 70% of operating income. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Tony for a discussion on RPOs. Tony, I would agree with that. I think right on the commercial side, it is the only market sector where on a quarter-to-date basis, we are down on the Construction side. It's exactly what we expected, both electrically and mechanically. And as Tony said before, we've pivoted ourselves elsewhere where we are seeing growth. And then on commercial, if the question is specific to commercial site based where we've talked about the headwinds there, it's exactly the contracts that we spoke about at the end of December. The revenue decline there is exactly what we anticipated. And Building Services is operating collectively as a segment right where we thought it would be, right, the growth in the quarter being 1% and on a year-to-date basis at 4%. Yes. If you look at the guidance, really what we've assumed there, and I touched on the midpoint, right, which is if you look at the midpoint of our guidance, we're saying we can repeat in the back half of the year what we've done through the first 6 months of the year. When you look at those, the low end of the guidance, we're essentially saying we believe that at the low end, we can achieve the record margins that we achieved in the back half of last year. And if you look at the high end, we're essentially assuming 30 to 40 basis points above where we're at today. I think you hit on it all, Tony. Yes. I think overall, right, no real change in strategy here. I think we'll continue to be balanced capital allocators. As Tony said, we're pleased with what we did through the first half of the year, right? We generated $412 million of operating cash, but our cash balances remain largely unchanged from the end of 2023. And that's the acquisitions at $173 million, the share repurchases at $149 million, our CapEx and our dividends. And in the back of our slide deck, I think it's Slide 13, we've updated our historical capital allocation here. If you look where we are so far this year, it's weighted 45% to shareholder return and 55% to business reinvestment. And if you look over time, we're closer to 50-50, and we'll continue to strive for that over time. So I think a long-winded way to say the back half of the year should look very similar to the first half."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the EMCOR Group's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] \n I will now turn the call over to Andy Backman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Backman, you may begin. \nAndrew Backman: Thank you, Marliese, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to EMCOR's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. For those of you joining us by webcast, we are at the beginning of our slide presentation that will accompany our remarks today. This presentation will be archived in the Investor Relations section of our website at emcorgroup.com. \n With me today are Tony Guzzi, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jason Nalbandian, Senior Vice President and EMCOR's newly appointed Chief Financial Officer; and Maxine Mauricio, Executive Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel. \n For today's call, Tony will provide comments on our first quarter. Jason will then review our first quarter numbers before turning it back to Tony to discuss RPOs, key market drivers and how they impact our business segments, as well as reviewing our revised 2024 guidance before we open it up for Q&A. \n Before we begin, as a reminder, this presentation and discussion contains certain forward-looking statements and may contain certain non-GAAP financial information. Slide 2 of our presentation describes in detail these forward-looking statements and the non-GAAP financial information disclosures. I encourage everyone to review both disclosures in conjunction with our discussion and accompanying slides. \n And finally, as a reminder, all financial information discussed during this morning's call is included in our consolidated financial statements within both our earnings press release issued this morning and in our Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \n And with that, let me turn the call over to Tony. Tony? \nAnthony Guzzi: Good morning. Thanks, Andy, and thanks all of you for joining our call. I'm going to begin my discussion on Page 4. We had an exceptional start to the year at EMCOR. It was another quarter of records as our performance established new first quarter records for revenues, operating income, operating margin and diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. \n We earned $4.17 per diluted share and grew revenues by 18.7% to $3.43 billion. Revenues increased 18.5% organically. And we were still able to grow RPOs to $9.2 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion or 16.5% versus the year-ago period. Our consolidated operating margin was a very strong 7.6%. \n The performance of our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments this quarter continued to exceed our already high expectations. Our Electrical Construction segment revenues grew 18.6% with operating margin reaching a record 12%. Our Mechanical Construction segment grew revenues 32.4% with record first quarter revenues and a record first quarter operating margin of 10.6%. \n We executed well with strong demand across many of the market sectors we serve, including high-tech and traditional manufacturing as well as network and communications, which includes our data center work. We had outstanding performance at some of the most demanding projects for our most sophisticated customers. \n Central to our success is how our leadership teams effectively plan where and how we will compete and select the right sectors and geographies that allow us the best opportunity to earn the best outcome when deploying our precious resources. Then our excellence in BIM, which is really a lot more than building information modeling, it's much evolved into virtual design and construction. You'll hear me talk about VDC, that's how we talk about it at EMCOR. Which then moves into prefabrication, estimating, project planning and management, and our best-in-class labor sourcing management and training have all supported and continue to support this strong performance. \n Our leadership teams, from the segment, through the subsidiary level, down to our project managers and frontline supervision, are performing work productively and most importantly, safely, resulting in excellent outcomes for our customers and shareholders. \n Our Industrial Services segment reported its best quarter post pandemic. We continue to see improved demand for our services and completed some of our largest turnarounds in over 5 years. Our shops continue to perform well. And the electrical business within this segment is experiencing increased demand, both from traditional upstream and midstream customers as well as for certain renewable fuel projects. \n Within our U.S. Building Services segment, our Mechanical Services business continues to perform well with a solid high single-digit operating margins. And strong demand persists for our energy efficiency, building controls and retrofit projects. Our U.K. business continues to hold up well despite a tough economic environment. \n We always have challenges, and this quarter was no different. As mentioned in our last few calls, we've had a few contract losses in our U.S. site-based services business as real estate companies, in this market, continue to be aggressive and take work at or near cost. In addition, during this past month, we had a retail customer file for bankruptcy, which caused us to increase our bad debt reserves, offsetting the increased profitability otherwise experienced within our U.S. Building Services segment. \n Overall, we had a great quarter and are seeing continued strength in the market trends we have been discussing for the past few quarters. In addition, in April, we closed 3 acquisitions that will add to our capabilities in our Mechanical Construction segment and our U.S. Building Services segment. We spent $137 million in upfront consideration on these 3 acquisitions and are excited to integrate them into our business, and integration is well underway. We've also signed a definitive agreement to acquire another company for $38 million that will add to the electrical capabilities in our Industrial Services segment. This acquisition is expected to close on or around May 1. \n We ended the quarter with strong RPOs and a balance sheet that continues to support the growth of our business, both organically and through acquisition. \n With that being said, Jason, I will turn the call over to you. \nJason Nalbandian: Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Over the next several slides, I'll review our operating performance for each of our segments as well as some of the key financial data for the first quarter of 2024 in comparison to the first quarter of 2023. \n I'm going to start on Slide 5, which is revenues. As Tony mentioned, consolidated revenues were $3.43 billion, an increase of $541.8 million or 18.7%. Each of our domestic reportable segments experienced year-over-year increases in revenue, and with organic growth of 18.5%, substantially all of this growth was organic. \n If we look at each of our segments. Revenues of U.S. Electrical Construction were $764.7 million, an increase of 18.6%. This segment continues to benefit from growth across many of the market sectors in which we participate with the most significant revenue growth in network and communications, which is predominantly our data center projects. The increased need for cloud computing, data storage and the emergence of AI have accelerated the demand for these services. \n Revenues in U.S. Mechanical Construction were $1.4 billion, increasing 32.4%, with revenue growth across the majority of the market sectors in which we operate. While the most significant growth occurred in the high-tech manufacturing market sector, we also saw notable increases in manufacturing, industrial, institutional and network and communications. \n As we've mentioned on previous calls, as a result of projects for customers engaged in the design and manufacturing of semiconductors as well as the production and development of electric vehicles and related battery technologies, this segment is experiencing strong demand for both its traditional mechanical services as well as our fire and life safety offerings. \n Coupled with the continued build-out of hyperscale data centers and domestic near-shoring and reshoring, these trends continue to be the driving factors behind the segment's significant organic revenue growth. Together, our domestic construction segments generated revenues of $2.2 billion, an increase of just over 27%. \n If we move to U.S. Building Services, revenues grew 7.7% or 6.6% organically to $781.2 million. The most significant growth in this segment was generated by our Mechanical Services division. We continue to benefit from strong demand for HVAC projects and retrofits as well as building automation and control services. In addition, we're experiencing service volume growth due in part to an expanded customer base. \n Looking at U.S. Industrial Services. Revenues were $354 million, increasing 7% year-over-year. With contracts of a more typical size, we executed against a more normal turnaround season and benefited from scope expansion on certain of these projects. This segment additionally benefited from increased demand for certain renewable fuel projects within the quarters. \n And lastly on this slide. Revenues of $104.7 million for our U.K. Building Services segment was exceptional despite a tough operating environment which has led to lower facilities maintenance and discretionary project revenues. \n If we turn to Slide 6, you can see operating income for the quarter was $260 million or 7.6% of revenues. This compares favorably to operating income of just under $155 million or 5.4% of revenues a year ago. A more favorable mix of work and exceptional project execution continue to be the drivers of our improved performance. \n Once again, if we look at each of our segments, U.S. Electrical Construction is reporting operating income of $91.6 million, which represents a 126% increase; an operating margin of 12%, which is a 570 basis point improvement. Increased gross profit and gross profit margin were the primary drivers of this performance, with the most notable increases in gross profit within network and communications, commercial, and manufacturing and industrial. \n Operating income for U.S. Mechanical Construction was $150.7 million, an increase of nearly 75%. And operating margin of 10.6% represents a 260 basis point improvement. This segment experienced increases in gross profit from the majority of the market sectors in which we operate with the most notable contribution being generated within the high-tech manufacturing and commercial market sectors. \n I should also point out that in addition to increased gross profit margin, the operating margin of each of our construction segments benefited from a reduction in SG&A margin as we leveraged our overhead cost structure during this period of growth. Together, our domestic construction segments earned operating margin of 11.1%. \n Operating income for U.S. Building Services was $33.5 million or 4.3% of revenues. While revenues and gross profit of this segment both exceeded that of the prior year, operating income and operating margin decreased by $4 million and 90 basis points. \n Unfortunately, a customer bankruptcy within our commercial site-based services division more than offset the increased profitability generated by our Mechanical Services group during the quarter. This bankruptcy negatively impacted operating income and operating margin of this segment by $11 million and 140 basis points. \n Moving to Industrial Services. Operating income was $18 million or 5.1% of revenues, representing an increase in operating income of 19.6% and a 60 basis point improvement in operating margin. In addition to a slight increase in gross profit margin, this segment benefited from greater overhead absorption, given the increase in quarterly revenues previously mentioned. \n And lastly, U.K. Building Services is reporting operating income of $5.4 million or 5.1% of revenues. Despite a reduction in quarterly revenues of this segment, operating income is in line with that of the prior year and operating margin has improved by 20 basis points, as we continue to optimize our project and service mix while seeking to more effectively leverage the overhead cost structure of this segment. \n Let's turn to Slide 7. We've covered most of this slide already, but I did want to briefly look at SG&A and diluted earnings per share. If we start with SG&A, as I mentioned while reviewing the operating performance of our segments, we were successful in leveraging our overhead cost structure, as evidenced by the 10 basis point reduction in SG&A margin from 9.7% to 9.6%. But I should also point out that somewhat masking our SG&A leverage is the provision we took for the customer bankruptcy within U.S. Building Services, which negatively impacted our consolidated SG&A margin by 40 basis points. \n And moving to EPS. Diluted earnings per share was $4.17, a nearly 80% increase compared to $2.32 in Q1 of 2023. This EPS performance, like many of our first quarter financial metrics, established a new record for EMCOR for a first quarter. \n And finally, if we turn to Slide 8, the strength of EMCOR's balance sheet continues to be a differentiator for us in the market, providing our customers with confidence as we bid on large-scale, complex and demanding projects. Given the size and strength of our balance sheet, including $841 million of cash on hand and $1.2 billion of capacity available to us under our revolving credit facility, coupled with our significant cash generation, we remain well positioned to fund organic growth, pursue strategic M&A and return capital to shareholders. \n Although not shown on this slide, operating cash flow for the quarter was $132.3 million, which represents approximately 50% of operating income. As I mentioned on last quarter's earnings call, on an annual basis, we do expect operating cash flow to be in line with a normalized historical average of between 75% to 80% of operating income or approximately equal to net income. \n And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Tony for a review of our RPO and market sectors. \nAnthony Guzzi: Thanks, Jason. I'm now on Slide 9. So on Slide 9, you'll see a chart that I've discussed, it's a little bit reformatted over the last 4 quarters, which highlights some of the key market sectors where we are seeing growth. In many ways, this chart, over a long period of time, and we start showing it about 4 quarters, but this idea behind this chart has really been how we allocated resource for the last 5 years or so. \n And now let me get into the details of this chart. We reformat a little bit, so we put things together here. And I'm going to start on the upper left-hand corner and talk about data centers and connectivity. We have that in network and communications. And our RPOs are up 9%, 51% year-over-year. And they're at a record $1.7 billion. On a year-over-year basis, they're up $575 million. A lot of this will tie to the information on the next page. I'm not going to cover it twice. \n We continue to see strong demand for data center, and let me sort of reflect a little bit. We've been on calls about 4 or 6 quarters ago where people were talking about was data center demand slowing? We hadn't seen that, and part of that could be our market position with really good customers that really value what we do to help deliver great projects for them. \n And -- but also, I think we were seeing the beginning of the AI almost 6 quarters ago. And it has become more pronounced. You can't pick up a newspaper today without seeing and talking about data center growth and the quest for more data and more computing power. They also need more energy, and I think that will play out over time to EMCOR's favor later as we continue to build out all sources of energy. \n But right now, let's focus on data centers. We're well positioned. I'll just give you sort of some top-level numbers on how we think about the market. It's a geographic market and it's a national market. On a geographic basis today, and if you rewound that tape to early 2019, we were only servicing maybe 3 data center markets. And that was pretty much where the markets were. We've expanded -- that was electrically. And today, we're servicing 9 data center markets, and a lot of that driven by our customers. \n Now we've done that through acquisition to better serve our customers. We've done that through organic growth, taking our existing operations and teaching them how to do more, but -- through a lot of peer learning. And we've done that through greenfield expansion. And so now we're able to serve more customers in a better way and deliver more projects for them to serve their ultimate customers. \n On the mechanical side, we were really only servicing one major market in 2019. And through acquisition and organic growth, capability building, today, we service 6. And really, a lot of it has to do with -- really, acquisition has been part of it. But really, a lot of it has to do with just strong organic growth, capability growing, peer learning and greenfield expansion. \n And so we have to serve our customers. We love to serve our customers. We have some of the best data center capability in the industry, so do other people, and we'll continue to build that capability and build the resources we need to perform. And this is where the virtual design and construct. \n This page really, other than energy efficiency, is a page that's focused on virtual design and construct and what we bring to the market. As we get to energy efficiency and sustainability, sequentially we're up 9%, 8% year-over-year. This has been a good long-term market for EMCOR. We're really good at it. \n Now if you just think about it broadly, energy costs are going up. Paybacks are coming down. You would expect this to continue to grow. And then you add on top of it the people looking for more sustainable solutions for their facilities. They have all committed to different goals through carbon and energy reduction. \n Now what drives this is equipment today is much more efficient than it was 10 or 15 years ago. And this has been going on for 20, 25 years. But what's really driving that? You can only add so much copper to the equipment to make it more efficient. So it's really also being driven by variable speed drive motors, especially in the air handlers and some of the chillers, and even in some of the rooftop units. It's being driven by better integration of digital controls, not only at product integrated controls, but also the control systems. And we're able to bring that solution. Any of -- there's still pneumatic controls out there. And the more you take those out, you bring efficiency. \n So the digital controls are better, the equipment is better, and our installation capability continues to be -- and our ability to analyze the building. And if you look at EMCOR today, we have 500 energy engineers and people that are LEED-certified through the business helping people come up with these solutions. \n Then you bring in also the continued benefit of some alternative energy solutions where people want to integrate that into that solution. And we really can offer a great solution for our end customers. And these tend to be, on with our biggest customers, multiyear program to think about how they make their facilities, offices, factories more energy efficient. And then -- and there is some government incentive that's supporting this. It started with the CARES Act, and there's been a couple of other acts that helped that do that. \n You get to health care, this has been a good long-term market for EMCOR. There's -- any city where we operate, people want us to be part of that solution because, again, the same things that make you great in data centers, the same things that make you set in advanced manufacturing, a hospital in today's world looks like an advanced manufacturing plant to us. \n With all the different systems that come to play to make that hospital functional, you need a contractor that can bring that VDC capability. That's really the birthplace of BIM and VDC for EMCOR, was the health care sector 18 years ago, 20 years ago. \n Now hospitals need to be more flexible. That was happening before COVID. COVID put that on exponential growth for more flexibility. The outpatient facilities are more sophisticated. And you're doing that both in a retrofit market and a new construction market. And then you have the ongoing work to make those facilities more efficient and more energy efficient. These are big energy users, and of course, they can't go down, right? They need 100% power all the time, just like the data centers. \n Now let's drop to the bottom of the page and talk about these things together and focus on the center, which is reshoring, near-shoring. I don't think you can separate what's going on in the chip space from reshoring, right? It was a national security issue that started to drive the CHIPS Act, which started to drive people to want to invest here, right? It wasn't like we woke up one morning and say, \"Hey, we're comfortable with having 85% of our chip production somewhere else other than the United States.\" So that was a reshoring trend. \n But it goes beyond that. We saw some of that even before the CHIPS Act. It helped stabilize it and make it -- I think it's going to extend the cycle. But you also saw it in other industries. And that's why we made the investments we made in our organic businesses in the Southeast, but also built through acquisition a footprint in the Southeast because we wanted to be part of this trend. And this has been going on for 15 years at EMCOR to better serve our customers. \n And now you have the high-tech manufacturing and life sciences. And really what's driving high-tech manufacturing, a lot of it's chip work for us. And what do you need to do that? Well, the legislation is written that you need a great workforce that came from an apprentice program, that's highly trained, that pays good wages, that operate safely. And quite frankly, it's written to benefit the union contractor or the nonunion contractor, that wage and benefits-wise, looks an awful lot like a union contractor. \n And then you get to life sciences, a lot of this was coming back anyway. The disruption in the supply chains caused by COVID made more of it come. And then you take it and then you think about all the new drugs, especially the weight loss drugs. And we're in all the right places to support that, whether it be in Indiana, whether it be in the Research Triangle Park or New Jersey, mechanically, electrically and some of our prime contracting ability on the industrial side. \n When you get to the EV value chain, look, I don't know whether it's going to be 10% penetration, 15% penetration or 20% penetration. We just know it's going to be more than it is today. And the infrastructure, which is what we've mainly been participating in, that's going to be built, we're going to participate in. \n And when you look at this bottom page, where all of our trades are participating, whether it be fire or life safety, whether it be mechanical or electrical. And that's really true for this whole page. I would say the energy efficiency for us is mainly a mechanical, mechanical services play. \n But the other ones, all our company, we're not in every market doing everything, but we have capability there to really play in all of this. And that's what this is, a resource allocation chart. And we think about that long and hard. And we've been thinking about this chart really for 6, 7 years now. \n And now I'm going to go to the next page on 10, and I'm not going to belabor the point other than to add we had pretty good growth outside of that page, right? I mean, our water and wastewater, which you can see on the right-hand side, is now $636 million. It's up 30%. \n And these are bigger awards. They typically become episodic. And most of our work is being performed in Florida for the reasons that you know. There was a Consent Decree about 6 years ago in Miami Dade. But also, it's just growth in population in Florida, both on the East and West Coast of Florida, and we participate in both. \n Institutional was actually a little bit of a surprise to us. The work now at a new record RPO and up 36% year-over-year. I guess it shouldn't have been. We have capability, and the kind of things we do in the institutional sector, whether it's K-12 schools on the energy efficiency side and remodel, or really a lot of this is being driven by state and local federal buildings, but mainly campuses and institutions that have broader campus settings in a multiyear program. \n And a lot of these facilities, whether it be better connectivity, where we're helping them get better WiFi across the whole campus; or it's quite simply energy efficiency programs across the campus; or building research facilities that look an awful lot like the life science labs and facilities that we talked about on the previous page. \n Transportation grew for us. Again, that's episodic in nature also. But this right now for us is electrical work and it's airports and traffic control systems. \n And then the short duration project, which mixes into a lot of the energy efficiency work and is more broadly based is up nearly 9%. That's a good sign. Now that's pretty interesting because what's happening there is we're back into a book-to-bill mode. We figure out the supply chain. Lead times are extended. We had the bubble there, in short. I actually didn't think it would continue to grow the way it's been. But that just shows you the strong underlying demand for people to get more efficient and upgrade their facilities. Some of it is as simple as they have to be competitive in a triple net lease environment. And if they don't upgrade it, they won't be. \n Now we have had some decrease in commercial. As Jason described, it's still a big part of what we do, still pretty profitable. Again, commercial for us has not been a new office building sector for a long time. Now we will go in and do tenant bid-out work, multiple floors for high-end clients, like some of you listening to this call. We will do that work. But -- and also, the decrease mainly was some of the logistical work we were doing for large dry good distribution centers. That would be both electrical and fire or life safety. \n But we have seen an increase in cold storage warehouses, which are smaller in dollar award that require actually a higher skill for us to do, both from a mechanical -- especially some of the refrigerant work on that, and fire or life safety. \n So you put all that together and you look at the right-hand -- left-hand side, we're up in domestic construction substantially, $1.2 billion over year. We're up in Building Services. And industrial has good bookings in its shop work. \n So now what does that lead you to do? You go to Page 11, which is what most of you care about. We had this robust performance. You got to look at it and say, what are you going to do? Well, we're going to increase guidance, right? And we're going to -- we're executing exceptionally well, really better than we ever have. We have really strong mix in our RPOs. We're winning the right work in the right markets. They're significant projects that are technically complex with accelerated timelines and scope expansion and more reasonable contract terms, especially in our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments. \n As a result of that, our EPS guidance range is going to go from $14 to $15 per share, to $15.50 to $16.50 per share. We're also going to increase our revenue guidance from a range of $13.5 billion to $14 billion, to $14 billion to $14.5 billion. \n In order to achieve the end of this revised guidance range, we got to keep executing with discipline and precision, the results and strong operating margin. And what we're telling you on this call to save you asking the question, in this guidance, we plan on operating the business this year between 7% and 7.5% operating margins. \n We're going to continue to face challenges. We talked about one today. We're going to continue to face challenges, both in our site-based business in the U.S. and U.K. We'll work through those. We've shown we can do that. \n Macro factors, such as high interest rates, supply chain, energy price disruptions, global conflicts, they're all going to post challenges for us. I'd like to say that we haven't done all that in the past and been good at it, but we are. We will develop contingency plans. We have them, we develop them every day. And we execute as best as we can to overcome these challenges. \n We're also going to remain diligent in those that are more exposed, especially to high interest rates. And for us, that means our commercial real estate and private equity customers. \n We're going to continue to be balanced capital allocators and invest in organic growth as well as strategic acquisitions. We've already done more acquisitions year-to-date this year than we have in the last 2 years and -- individually in those years. And we already really like what we've done because it continues to build the business for the long term and serve our customers better. \n Finally -- by the way, our acquisition pipeline is robust. And you would expect that. I'm going to get into that, I'll save you the question. Why is it robust? Because people are doing better after the pandemic, right? People -- good companies aren't for sale when they're not doing well. They become for sale when they're doing well. In the markets we're serving, they're doing well. Also maybe not as well as we are, but they're doing well. And so that's when companies become for sale. \n And like I've always said 1,000 times over, never fall in love with a deal, and deals happen when they happen. I've done this long enough that I don't fall in love with deals. Maybe I did that 20 years ago. \n Finally, I want to thank all of the EMCOR leaders and teammates for their hard work and dedication to serving our customers, primarily in a safe and productive way. We put safety first as one of our core values. \n Personally, I'm grateful to lead such an outstanding team. We do lead our company through our EMCOR values and mission first, people always. And we're going to be continuing to be focused on executing our mission for our customers and shareholders while keeping EMCOR a great place to work for all employees. \n With that, Marliese, I'll turn it over to you and take any questions you may have. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] At this time, we'll start with a question from Brent Thielman from DA Davidson. \nBrent Thielman: Tony, I guess the manufacturing and the high-tech manufacturing verticals, how do you think about the sustainability of those areas without government incentives? And then also, how much of those verticals for you are being driven by, call them, mega jobs that might require kind of billions of investment versus sort of more selected -- that might be more selective versus kind of broader-based investment? \nAnthony Guzzi: I don't know how to parse the second one really as far as mega jobs versus -- but we're seeing demand being pretty strong across it. My general view on some of the high-tech manufacturing areas that have been built, you think about there's probably 6 semiconductor or 7 semiconductor markets. They've been semiconductor markets. There is a rebirth in some of those markets. \n The only real new one is the one in outside Syracuse in Clay, New York. The other one is where the business happened, right? It was happening in Phoenix before. It was happening in Austin, Texas before. It was happening -- Columbus, Ohio was new also, I guess. But I think Intel has been thinking of expanding. Boise, Idaho was happening before. Salt Lake City was happening before. Oregon was happening before. So these for the most part, other than maybe 2 markets, have been well-established markets. Even Raleigh, North Carolina. I mean, Wolfspeed, which is one of the customers -- that was Cree one time, and Cree did semiconductors for their lighting products and decided just to focus on semiconductors. \n So I think a lot of it would be happening anyway. I think they realized they were too exposed to the supply chain. The supply chain had to move more to the U.S. It's pretty obvious why you can't -- if you're a Taiwan semiconductor, why you just can't be in Taiwan. It's both a diversification. It's what any responsible business would do. \n Intel is investing for their next generation. I mean, Intel was not cash-poor, neither is Samsung, neither is Micron. These are very good companies that know how to invest through a cycle. \n Now what have the government incentives done? Well, they've done a couple of things, right? I think they've helped strengthen commitment to a site. I think they've also sort of put some rules around how the work will get done and with what kind of people and what kind of trade skill, which is very high trade skill, which was probably going to happen anyway because you need the kind of people that we're privileged to have here at EMCOR and working with us to do those kind of jobs. \n But I think it lengthens it and it makes it less turbulent as far as how it will get built out because I think there's a fairly significant surety of supply in national security play. And then you combine that with the need for AI chips, they have a market, right? \n Now there's been a lot of talk when you get to that specific market, is are they stopping? Are they starting? Pauses and stops and maybe our award sizes won't be so big. But the sites we're working on today, we feel really good, are long-term sites. We have a couple more we're helping start the infrastructure on. We'll see what happens there. So that one we feel good about it. \n You get to the broader industrial, this was happening. It was just starting to happen pre-COVID. It's why we invested in the Southeast from 2008 to 2020 through acquisition and then organic expansion and building capability. And we have some great companies down there, right? I mean these are market leaders led by really strong teams, and we're a destination employer. \n But people are bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. Why now? Part of it was energy before. We were lower-cost energy. I'm not going to get into all the scenario around why we're not as lower cost as we were at one time. But we're also a more safe market. And quite frankly, the logistical challenges and the cost advantages of being in China and Southeast Asia aren't what they once were. And so -- and then with automation, when you bring it back, you can have better supply. \n And then you think about what happened with COVID. I said this before, I used to be a manufacturer, right? So -- and I used to do a lot of work around manufacturing in a previous life. We started with we always wanted 2 suppliers for most of our critical components, right, if you go back 25 years. And then we said, \"Okay, well, maybe we don't need to do that for the critical components. We at least need our key suppliers to be doing that out of 2 factories.\" And then we got sloppy over the last 10 years, and we said, \"Well, we can have one supplier out of one factory, and we'll be okay, and that doesn't matter whether that was in Mexico or China or Eastern Europe.\" That didn't turn out to be okay, right? \n And now we're back to building supply chain redundancy. And the natural catching point for that supply chain redundancy is the U.S., and that's mainly centered in the mid-central places like Indiana, the Southeast and Texas, quite frankly. And so we feel really bullish about that. \n Look, there'll be ups and downs. Maybe the awards won't be as large in the future, but we're well entrenched with some key customers and some key sites to deliver great results for them on really sophisticated projects. \nBrent Thielman: Okay. Okay. Appreciate that. And then just on the Electrical business, I mean, 12% margins is exceptional. Just wondering, can you unpack that? I mean, what leads to a 12% sort of print here? Just the way to think about it -- going forward. \nAnthony Guzzi: Yes, I'm going to -- I never talk about go-forward margins. We always think about it in bands and we always think about it over sort of 8 quarters, looking back. But it wasn't all that too long ago in the first quarter of 2022, not to bring up a more challenging time for us, where we had, through supply chain, a lot of jobs stalled in the Electrical sector. And we weren't earning the margins. I think we earned 6% margin or high 5s that quarter. And external folks' hairs were on fire, and we sort of knew what the drivers were. And I would say those drivers flipped this quarter, right? \n So the drivers of why we didn't do well, it had nothing to do with execution in the field. We -- maybe we had a little unproductive labor because we kept people and we were waiting for jobs, that didn't start up, to start up. We had some supply chain stalls that caused that. And then that caused people to delay the site conditions and the buildup. And so we did the right thing. We kept our powder dry. We kept some of our key labor, especially supervision, because we knew we were going to begin on the work. \n I would say the opposite happened this quarter. We had near-flawless execution in our Electrical business on a really good mix of work that led to these results. Is it always going to be this good? Probably not. But we have a really good Electrical business, led in the field by really capable people with a great segment team. \n Yes, Jason? \nJason Nalbandian: The only thing I would add there, right, is it truly is a combination of execution and mix in the quarter. There's no anomalies when we look at large project closeouts or project losses, anything to that effect really netted to near 0 in the quarter. So it truly is mix and execution. \n I think 12% is a record quarterly operating margin for Electrical. So I wouldn't necessarily say that, that's the new norm. I think to Tony's point, it makes sense to look at it over a 15- to 18-month period, and that's probably something we can expect to see from Electrical in the near term. \nAnthony Guzzi: If you looked at our electrical team and our mechanical team and say, what do they actually focus on? They look at the operating margin in a given quarter as an output metric. So what are they focused on? The inputs, right? How productive is the labor on a job? How safe is that labor on a job? How much portion of the job we've been able to put through our VDC process, which is prefab, BIM modeling? How successful we've been in negotiating the contract to have constructive discussions as scope expands? \n They're looking at the input metrics, right? And then they're looking at the absorption they're getting on their overhead as they do this work. And that leads to great results. I mean I think they look at the end of the quarter and look down at the results, hey, that's pretty good. But they're back to focusing on the input metrics. \nBrent Thielman: Okay. And Tony or Jason, I mean, just with respect to the comments on mix also in the context of the guidance, and I realize it moves around quarter-to-quarter. I guess when I think about mix for you guys, it's sort of larger, more complex sort of developments that require some level of sophistication that you bring. Why would that look any different going forward? \nAnthony Guzzi: I don't think it will, at least in our guidance. Jason, you agree? \nJason Nalbandian: Yes. And I think, right, when you look at our guidance, as Tony said, margins for the year between 7% and 7.5%, right? I think the thing to remember is 7% margins will be equivalent to what we did on an annual basis in 2023, which was a record. And 7.5% margin is really our trailing 12-month average margin. And so I think what we're saying there is that mix we expect for the remainder of the year is consistent with the mix we've seen in the last 12 months. \nAnthony Guzzi: Or -- and if you think about the input side of that, we're doing a really good job on resource allocation. And that extends -- obviously, you see it in the construction segment over the last several quarters. But quite frankly, you're also seeing it in Building Services because of what's happening in Mechanical Services and building controls, right? The mix there is very good also. \n And look, the industrial team also has focused the mix in a good direction, whether it's how they manage the mix within their shops, of the 5 shops we have, how they think about their field resources and how they do that versus some of the specialty services we have versus the turnaround. \n And then quite frankly, we're pretty excited about some of the things we have going on in our Electrical business and then how they think about mix there. When you have really precious resources like we have, and for us, that really means supervision, shop capability, VDC capability, project engineers, project managers, we think hard and long about what we're going to commit to over a long period of time and what's more attractive. And quite frankly, what's happening with us, we're winning, right? Our customers are choosing us because we deliver for them. \nOperator: And now we will take a question from Adam Thalhimer from Thompson, Davis. \nAdam Thalhimer: Great quarter. Congrats on that. And Jason, welcome to the call. \nJason Nalbandian: Thank you. \nAdam Thalhimer: Tony, can you just keep going on that? Because I was actually curious how you do allocate resources. How much of it is top-down, like you're having the discussion with the customers? And how much of it is your subsidiaries? \nAnthony Guzzi: Most of it is at the subsidiary and segment level. We -- for lack of a better word, we, at the segment and corporate level think, we put out our intent. We think about markets, we think about where is the best place for us to allocate our resources, how we're going to allocate them. \n But our fighting unit, quite frankly at EMCOR, is our subsidiaries, and they're good. And then within those subsidiaries, right, we think about which subsidiaries get more investment versus other subsidiaries because of the opportunities that are in front of them. \n And it's a very thoughtful process. We have very sophisticated business leaders at the subsidiary level, supported by great relationships whether -- with labor, whether it's union or nonunion, with superintendents and project foreman and project managers. And they look at their playing field and say, what's the best way to allocate these resources to derive the best results for our company, their people; the best results for our customers; and to build something that's sustainable in these markets based on the opportunities they see in front of them. And for us, that's usually a 6- to 24-month planning horizon at the subsidiary level and then thinking about how that builds capability. \n So look, what makes a great data center builder makes a good complex project builder that can do things under pressure with a fast timeline with a demanding customer. A lot of markets that look like that, but you have to build that capability. \n And then what we do a really good job of, and this is where our segment teams do an exceptional job of, how do you -- you don't move the people for a long period of time, but how do you peer learn? Peer learning at EMCOR is a big deal. So I talked about the expansion into other markets that we've done. It's not like we -- every place that we expanded into a data center market, we didn't have a company. It's just they weren't serving a data center market. And so the team or the electrical team said, \"Okay, we do this really well. Why can't we do it here? And when we do it here, this is how we have to think about let's go way back here to estimating. So we'll work together on the estimate. And then how do we think about building the VDC capability? How do we think about prefab in that market? What does schedule start to look like?\" \n Because we're going to make a commitment to a customer we probably have in another market to tell them now we can do that in this market. And for our guys, that's a pretty high bar to jump over, to have them trained up and ready to go. And that's how our folks think about it. That's one example that's happening every day across our company. \nAdam Thalhimer: I guess you've kind of put a speed governor on the RPO growth. Is that fair? \nAnthony Guzzi: We don't take work we don't think we can execute. That's true. But I wouldn't -- I've heard other people say, \"Hey, we're turning away work.\" I don't think that would be true here. I think we think about what we're going to bid. And when we bid the work or estimate the work or work in partnership with our customers to think about taking the work, we're pretty sure we can execute it. And we may not win it all the time. We don't. We don't have everything that we want to win. \n But I wouldn't call it a speed governor, but we very much don't try to outrun our headlights, right? We try to stay within our capability. Where do contractors don't do well is where they don't have the capability to do a job, they grow beyond the capabilities and they lack the execution resources. So the way we build capability and build capacity is someone that had been an assistant project manager or assistant project engineer, a regular foreman, now can become a general foreman, maybe help us get another superintendent out on the field which allows us to build more labor force. And then that assistant project manager now can run their own work a year, 1.5 years later with the right training. And then we can build that capability. \n Or if we're going to expand in another market. So maybe one of our electricals that have done a pretty -- a lot of industrial work, we take that person and say, \"Okay, here's what's different between that work and data center work. Or here's what's different between that work and semiconductor work. And this is the things you need to be aware of.\" And they work with other EMCOR companies to understand those nuances. \n But I would say, yes, our governor is our capacity to build skill and -- it's not cash. It's not capital investment. It's building the human capital and acquiring the human capital and training that we feel comfortable we can expand the company. \nAdam Thalhimer: And sorry if I missed it. What was the forward look on data centers? \nAnthony Guzzi: I think it's pretty good. I mean, you read the same things we've done. We've done a lot of work on that. I think it's pretty good. I mean, we don't see any slowdown. And the thing that will constrain it, but then we'll fix that, we always do, people, is there will be more investment in the energy infrastructure, and then they'll keep growing. And there's nothing in the near term that suggests that's a problem, though. \nAdam Thalhimer: And are you seeing any -- to the extent you're seeing any weakness in nonres kind of more broadly, like commercial, I know you don't play there much. But it sounds like that would be confined to Building Services. \nAnthony Guzzi: No. That's not true. We just reallocate our resources. So we were very good at -- in the fire or life safety world, at large big box retail distribution centers. That slowed down on the dry goods side. That -- they're very capable people. We moved that capability to other places like battery plants, like semiconductor plants, through training, through a very careful, do in once, do it right, and get it right. We have a great team there, and we build that. \n So yes, there's slowdowns. I mean, there are certain markets -- I don't think the New York guys are running around spiking the ball in the end zone right now. They're working hard, and they're doing fine. But you wouldn't say that's a booming market. There's no Hudson Yards. There's none of that happening right now. \n Maybe a little slowdown in the Northeast overall, but that's been overcome by other parts of the country. I mean, nothing is always up and to the right, as you know, Adam. I mean, commercial, yes, we're not really in the light commercial business in any significant way, even in Building Services other than some of the maintenance contracts. So yes, I mean, we have our share of challenges. But luckily, we have more good than those challenges right now. \n Jason, do you have anything to add? \nJason Nalbandian: I think you covered it, Tony. \nOperator: And we continue with a question from Alex Dwyer from KeyBanc. \nAlexander Dwyer: Congrats on a great start to the year. \nAnthony Guzzi: Thanks. \nAlexander Dwyer: So I just wanted to ask about the productivity improvements we've seen over the past year. Like how broad-based have these improvements been in the business? Is it concentrated in a couple of end markets or projects or geographies? I just want to get a better sense for how much more room there is to run in like implementing prefab and virtual design and BIM throughout the broader company. \nAnthony Guzzi: Now look, Alex, the reality is we're every day trying to figure out that impact on our ongoing margins versus more favorable contract terms. I would say most of our margin enhancement is coming from execution. I mean, any job we do, there's plenty of competition. I mean, there's other people that know how to do this work. And so I never sit there and think about -- we have very capable competitors in every business that we have. So we're earning margins because we're earning them. \n And it's hard to separate. I would say this in general, right? The place where you have a multiyear build, like some of these data center markets or semiconductor markets or even the manufacturing sites, where you have a multiyear build, you get better. Your people get better, they get more productive. We think of better ways to do it. \n And if the mix of contracts skew more for us towards fixed price versus GMP with a fee, then we do better. If we can convert more GMP to fixed price, that's good for us and the owner because we have certainty -- they have certainty of cost. And somewhere 50%, 60% along the way, we also have certainty of outcome. Or we think we do. \n So it's hard to separate some of that stuff. I will tell you this, though, right? The more work we can do in the shop versus in the field, the better we do. The more we can get in the planning earlier with our VDC, the virtual design construct, and implement more of those tools, the earlier we can do that, the better off we work. \n And so I'll just give you a broad number. And we have -- we were probably around 500 VDC people, mainly BIM operators in 2019, end of '18. Today, that number is 1,500. Now you could draw a correlation between that and our margin increase. I think that's part of it, that we're doing more. \n And it goes beyond prefab. A lot of times, we simplify VDC to prefab, but it goes way beyond that. It goes to -- we have a couple of people that are really good. You start to build things in 4D or parametric, right? And what you're doing is you're finding the mistakes before you go to the site. And if you can find the mistakes before you go to the site and the collisions and all the things that are going to go wrong, then you perform better, right? \n The most frustrating thing in the world for a foreman or a trade person or project engineer, project manager is to have installed something and then have to take it out or have someone take your work out because they didn't get it right. And our people don't like rework even if we get paid for it. That's not -- you got folks are really proud of the work. \n Quality also goes up, right, with VDC, whether it's field installed or whether it's shop. Because, again, if you went to a construction site today, and it's almost any site, even the smaller projects, our guys for the most part are looking at something on an iPad or a workstation. And they're looking at what they're going to build in 3 dimensions on that iPad. And they visually see what they're going to build and what it should look like versus trying to read it in 2 dimensions just off a drawing. \n And our technology has seeped through the organization, and we really have taken the tools. Now we just take tools to make them better. We don't self-develop any of these tools because there's good tools out there. But we've really taken leadership of that. \n And we have a dedicated group that does that now in our construction segment. The two work together on electrical, mechanical. It's not that different. The mechanical is probably a little more complex and advanced than the electrical folks on this because think about there's flows happening, there's systems. Where the electrical is, it's more rigidity, conduit and runs, right? But both are doing more of it. \n And with electrical guys think about when they do VDC is, how do I take something I'm going to do 100 times and take that work out of the field so there's less connections and the connection is easier. That's broadly speaking how they think about it. \n And then we're doing more skids and assemblies in both mechanical and electrical. And again, that makes it more rigorous. It makes it more stable when it gets to the field and be able to be built. \n So I'd say is it half of why we're doing better productivity? Sure. And then some of it is just working better because we've done these jobs multiple times. And look, EMCOR is a wonderful peer learning environment. So that's the construction side. \n When you get to the smaller project, Mechanical Service side, it's a little different. There, when you're doing a project a lot of times, productivity is almost secondary to making sure you don't disrupt the owner. And then it becomes a logistical game because you're usually operating in a build site, right? So they got to keep working. And so our guys have to really understand that, get the logistics right, get that in and get the building up right. \n So when you're doing a retrofit project, especially a midsized to medium-sized and smaller one, there, you're thinking about how do I make my customer more productive when I do it? And then how do I make sure that I've covered all my contingencies when I have to do these very complex logistical jobs in a build site? So that's a long-winded answer to what you were searching for, but... \nJason Nalbandian: I think the only thing I would add, you asked specifically about investments in certain markets or different sectors. And I think, right, none of these investments are targeted at a single market sector, right? The same prefabrication facility that can do a high-tech manufacturing -- support a high-tech manufacturing project can support a health care project or any other sector that we're working in. And the same thing with VDC or BIM, right? It's not targeted at any subset of our work, other than more so to our construction side than our service side. \nAnthony Guzzi: Maybe, Jason, talk a little bit about how CapEx moved here and how do we build or build infrastructure or things like that. \nJason Nalbandian: In the quarter, relatively comparable year-over-year. And I think if you go to a full year of 2023, that's when you'd really see it compared to the full year of 2022. I think our CapEx was up roughly 60%, and that really was a lot of these investments that Tony has been talking about. And we'll continue to invest in prefab facilities. We'll continue to invest in BIM. We'll expand the facilities that we have where we need more capacity. And we'll find ways to add facilities in other markets where we currently don't have the same capacity we do elsewhere. \nAnthony Guzzi: But all our investments, someone asked the question earlier about are these top-down or are they bottom-up? They're bottom-up, but there's a receptive knowledgeable ear at the top to ascertain where the best way to invest, and also to provide resources when needed, to help them invest. \n We haven't turned down a significant capital investment here in 5 years. I only say 5 years because I don't remember before that, because our folks bring these forward, they tend to be very well thought. And they take a -- and as a contractor, just so we understand that, too, our folks are looking for less than 4-year cash payback when they make that infrastructure investment because we do think like contractors, right? \n We're looking at the current market and say, \"This is good for today, it'll be good for the future. But let's make sure we can earn today.\" And the other thing is we -- 95% I always qualify things, probably it's 100%, but 95% of our prefabrication is for us in our jobs. We don't prefabricate for the market. \nAlexander Dwyer: That's really helpful. So if I can just ask the next one. I guess like the Industrial Services outlook commentary, it seemed a lot more positive this quarter. Large turnarounds are coming through with the larger scopes and you're getting better overhead leverage on that. And then 1Q was the best performance since the pandemic. Like would you say there's better visibility now into customer spending plans and turnarounds now? Or is it still kind of different? \nAnthony Guzzi: I'd say yes and no, right? Yes in that we have pretty good visibility in that we understand they're going to do the work. But they could shift it from fourth quarter to first quarter or third quarter to fourth quarter. \n I would say that I had the privilege of seeing the kind of relationships our folks have firsthand recently at one of the biggest refining customers. And they're at the top, and they're deep. Why? Because we help that customer perform and solve problems. And ultimately, that's what that business comes down to. You have to have the best technical resources. \n And the good news I take away from what I've seen recently in that business is there's a little straining for manpower going on right now. And when that happens in the Gulf Coast, that's usually a good thing. It means that there's more activity going on. And when there's more activity going on, that's good for the larger contractors like us. \nOperator: Thank you very much. Mr. Guzzi, we have no further questions at this time. And I will turn it back to you for some closing comments, please. \nAnthony Guzzi: Look, we got off to a good start this year. It's been a -- we've been performing really well. I don't think you can ever discount the skill it takes of our folks in the field. You heard me talk about it earlier. \n And someone asked me an interesting question today. Are these decisions being made top-down at the segment level, subsidiary level? I'd say it's a team sport. But at the end of the day, we're only as good as our subsidiaries deliver on the projects that they commit to our customers. \n And with that, I'll thank them, and see you all in a couple of months. Bye. \nAndrew Backman: Great. Thank you, Tony, and thank you, Jason, and thank you, Maxine, and to all of you for joining us today. If you should have any follow-up questions, please do not hesitate to reach out. \n Thank you all again, and have a great day. And Marliese, could you please close the call? \nOperator: Yes. This conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect. Have a great rest of your day.",

            "name": "Anthony Guzzi",
            "content": "Good morning. Thanks, Andy, and thanks all of you for joining our call. I'm going to begin my discussion on Page 4. We had an exceptional start to the year at EMCOR. It was another quarter of records as our performance established new first quarter records for revenues, operating income, operating margin and diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. \n We earned $4.17 per diluted share and grew revenues by 18.7% to $3.43 billion. Revenues increased 18.5% organically. And we were still able to grow RPOs to $9.2 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion or 16.5% versus the year-ago period. Our consolidated operating margin was a very strong 7.6%. \n The performance of our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments this quarter continued to exceed our already high expectations. Our Electrical Construction segment revenues grew 18.6% with operating margin reaching a record 12%. Our Mechanical Construction segment grew revenues 32.4% with record first quarter revenues and a record first quarter operating margin of 10.6%. \n We executed well with strong demand across many of the market sectors we serve, including high-tech and traditional manufacturing as well as network and communications, which includes our data center work. We had outstanding performance at some of the most demanding projects for our most sophisticated customers. \n Central to our success is how our leadership teams effectively plan where and how we will compete and select the right sectors and geographies that allow us the best opportunity to earn the best outcome when deploying our precious resources. Then our excellence in BIM, which is really a lot more than building information modeling, it's much evolved into virtual design and construction. You'll hear me talk about VDC, that's how we talk about it at EMCOR. Which then moves into prefabrication, estimating, project planning and management, and our best-in-class labor sourcing management and training have all supported and continue to support this strong performance. \n Our leadership teams, from the segment, through the subsidiary level, down to our project managers and frontline supervision, are performing work productively and most importantly, safely, resulting in excellent outcomes for our customers and shareholders. \n Our Industrial Services segment reported its best quarter post pandemic. We continue to see improved demand for our services and completed some of our largest turnarounds in over 5 years. Our shops continue to perform well. And the electrical business within this segment is experiencing increased demand, both from traditional upstream and midstream customers as well as for certain renewable fuel projects. \n Within our U.S. Building Services segment, our Mechanical Services business continues to perform well with a solid high single-digit operating margins. And strong demand persists for our energy efficiency, building controls and retrofit projects. Our U.K. business continues to hold up well despite a tough economic environment. \n We always have challenges, and this quarter was no different. As mentioned in our last few calls, we've had a few contract losses in our U.S. site-based services business as real estate companies, in this market, continue to be aggressive and take work at or near cost. In addition, during this past month, we had a retail customer file for bankruptcy, which caused us to increase our bad debt reserves, offsetting the increased profitability otherwise experienced within our U.S. Building Services segment. \n Overall, we had a great quarter and are seeing continued strength in the market trends we have been discussing for the past few quarters. In addition, in April, we closed 3 acquisitions that will add to our capabilities in our Mechanical Construction segment and our U.S. Building Services segment. We spent $137 million in upfront consideration on these 3 acquisitions and are excited to integrate them into our business, and integration is well underway. We've also signed a definitive agreement to acquire another company for $38 million that will add to the electrical capabilities in our Industrial Services segment. This acquisition is expected to close on or around May 1. \n We ended the quarter with strong RPOs and a balance sheet that continues to support the growth of our business, both organically and through acquisition. \n With that being said, Jason, I will turn the call over to you. Thanks, Jason. I'm now on Slide 9. So on Slide 9, you'll see a chart that I've discussed, it's a little bit reformatted over the last 4 quarters, which highlights some of the key market sectors where we are seeing growth. In many ways, this chart, over a long period of time, and we start showing it about 4 quarters, but this idea behind this chart has really been how we allocated resource for the last 5 years or so. \n And now let me get into the details of this chart. We reformat a little bit, so we put things together here. And I'm going to start on the upper left-hand corner and talk about data centers and connectivity. We have that in network and communications. And our RPOs are up 9%, 51% year-over-year. And they're at a record $1.7 billion. On a year-over-year basis, they're up $575 million. A lot of this will tie to the information on the next page. I'm not going to cover it twice. \n We continue to see strong demand for data center, and let me sort of reflect a little bit. We've been on calls about 4 or 6 quarters ago where people were talking about was data center demand slowing? We hadn't seen that, and part of that could be our market position with really good customers that really value what we do to help deliver great projects for them. \n And -- but also, I think we were seeing the beginning of the AI almost 6 quarters ago. And it has become more pronounced. You can't pick up a newspaper today without seeing and talking about data center growth and the quest for more data and more computing power. They also need more energy, and I think that will play out over time to EMCOR's favor later as we continue to build out all sources of energy. \n But right now, let's focus on data centers. We're well positioned. I'll just give you sort of some top-level numbers on how we think about the market. It's a geographic market and it's a national market. On a geographic basis today, and if you rewound that tape to early 2019, we were only servicing maybe 3 data center markets. And that was pretty much where the markets were. We've expanded -- that was electrically. And today, we're servicing 9 data center markets, and a lot of that driven by our customers. \n Now we've done that through acquisition to better serve our customers. We've done that through organic growth, taking our existing operations and teaching them how to do more, but -- through a lot of peer learning. And we've done that through greenfield expansion. And so now we're able to serve more customers in a better way and deliver more projects for them to serve their ultimate customers. \n On the mechanical side, we were really only servicing one major market in 2019. And through acquisition and organic growth, capability building, today, we service 6. And really, a lot of it has to do with -- really, acquisition has been part of it. But really, a lot of it has to do with just strong organic growth, capability growing, peer learning and greenfield expansion. \n And so we have to serve our customers. We love to serve our customers. We have some of the best data center capability in the industry, so do other people, and we'll continue to build that capability and build the resources we need to perform. And this is where the virtual design and construct. \n This page really, other than energy efficiency, is a page that's focused on virtual design and construct and what we bring to the market. As we get to energy efficiency and sustainability, sequentially we're up 9%, 8% year-over-year. This has been a good long-term market for EMCOR. We're really good at it. \n Now if you just think about it broadly, energy costs are going up. Paybacks are coming down. You would expect this to continue to grow. And then you add on top of it the people looking for more sustainable solutions for their facilities. They have all committed to different goals through carbon and energy reduction. \n Now what drives this is equipment today is much more efficient than it was 10 or 15 years ago. And this has been going on for 20, 25 years. But what's really driving that? You can only add so much copper to the equipment to make it more efficient. So it's really also being driven by variable speed drive motors, especially in the air handlers and some of the chillers, and even in some of the rooftop units. It's being driven by better integration of digital controls, not only at product integrated controls, but also the control systems. And we're able to bring that solution. Any of -- there's still pneumatic controls out there. And the more you take those out, you bring efficiency. \n So the digital controls are better, the equipment is better, and our installation capability continues to be -- and our ability to analyze the building. And if you look at EMCOR today, we have 500 energy engineers and people that are LEED-certified through the business helping people come up with these solutions. \n Then you bring in also the continued benefit of some alternative energy solutions where people want to integrate that into that solution. And we really can offer a great solution for our end customers. And these tend to be, on with our biggest customers, multiyear program to think about how they make their facilities, offices, factories more energy efficient. And then -- and there is some government incentive that's supporting this. It started with the CARES Act, and there's been a couple of other acts that helped that do that. \n You get to health care, this has been a good long-term market for EMCOR. There's -- any city where we operate, people want us to be part of that solution because, again, the same things that make you great in data centers, the same things that make you set in advanced manufacturing, a hospital in today's world looks like an advanced manufacturing plant to us. \n With all the different systems that come to play to make that hospital functional, you need a contractor that can bring that VDC capability. That's really the birthplace of BIM and VDC for EMCOR, was the health care sector 18 years ago, 20 years ago. \n Now hospitals need to be more flexible. That was happening before COVID. COVID put that on exponential growth for more flexibility. The outpatient facilities are more sophisticated. And you're doing that both in a retrofit market and a new construction market. And then you have the ongoing work to make those facilities more efficient and more energy efficient. These are big energy users, and of course, they can't go down, right? They need 100% power all the time, just like the data centers. \n Now let's drop to the bottom of the page and talk about these things together and focus on the center, which is reshoring, near-shoring. I don't think you can separate what's going on in the chip space from reshoring, right? It was a national security issue that started to drive the CHIPS Act, which started to drive people to want to invest here, right? It wasn't like we woke up one morning and say, \"Hey, we're comfortable with having 85% of our chip production somewhere else other than the United States.\" So that was a reshoring trend. \n But it goes beyond that. We saw some of that even before the CHIPS Act. It helped stabilize it and make it -- I think it's going to extend the cycle. But you also saw it in other industries. And that's why we made the investments we made in our organic businesses in the Southeast, but also built through acquisition a footprint in the Southeast because we wanted to be part of this trend. And this has been going on for 15 years at EMCOR to better serve our customers. \n And now you have the high-tech manufacturing and life sciences. And really what's driving high-tech manufacturing, a lot of it's chip work for us. And what do you need to do that? Well, the legislation is written that you need a great workforce that came from an apprentice program, that's highly trained, that pays good wages, that operate safely. And quite frankly, it's written to benefit the union contractor or the nonunion contractor, that wage and benefits-wise, looks an awful lot like a union contractor. \n And then you get to life sciences, a lot of this was coming back anyway. The disruption in the supply chains caused by COVID made more of it come. And then you take it and then you think about all the new drugs, especially the weight loss drugs. And we're in all the right places to support that, whether it be in Indiana, whether it be in the Research Triangle Park or New Jersey, mechanically, electrically and some of our prime contracting ability on the industrial side. \n When you get to the EV value chain, look, I don't know whether it's going to be 10% penetration, 15% penetration or 20% penetration. We just know it's going to be more than it is today. And the infrastructure, which is what we've mainly been participating in, that's going to be built, we're going to participate in. \n And when you look at this bottom page, where all of our trades are participating, whether it be fire or life safety, whether it be mechanical or electrical. And that's really true for this whole page. I would say the energy efficiency for us is mainly a mechanical, mechanical services play. \n But the other ones, all our company, we're not in every market doing everything, but we have capability there to really play in all of this. And that's what this is, a resource allocation chart. And we think about that long and hard. And we've been thinking about this chart really for 6, 7 years now. \n And now I'm going to go to the next page on 10, and I'm not going to belabor the point other than to add we had pretty good growth outside of that page, right? I mean, our water and wastewater, which you can see on the right-hand side, is now $636 million. It's up 30%. \n And these are bigger awards. They typically become episodic. And most of our work is being performed in Florida for the reasons that you know. There was a Consent Decree about 6 years ago in Miami Dade. But also, it's just growth in population in Florida, both on the East and West Coast of Florida, and we participate in both. \n Institutional was actually a little bit of a surprise to us. The work now at a new record RPO and up 36% year-over-year. I guess it shouldn't have been. We have capability, and the kind of things we do in the institutional sector, whether it's K-12 schools on the energy efficiency side and remodel, or really a lot of this is being driven by state and local federal buildings, but mainly campuses and institutions that have broader campus settings in a multiyear program. \n And a lot of these facilities, whether it be better connectivity, where we're helping them get better WiFi across the whole campus; or it's quite simply energy efficiency programs across the campus; or building research facilities that look an awful lot like the life science labs and facilities that we talked about on the previous page. \n Transportation grew for us. Again, that's episodic in nature also. But this right now for us is electrical work and it's airports and traffic control systems. \n And then the short duration project, which mixes into a lot of the energy efficiency work and is more broadly based is up nearly 9%. That's a good sign. Now that's pretty interesting because what's happening there is we're back into a book-to-bill mode. We figure out the supply chain. Lead times are extended. We had the bubble there, in short. I actually didn't think it would continue to grow the way it's been. But that just shows you the strong underlying demand for people to get more efficient and upgrade their facilities. Some of it is as simple as they have to be competitive in a triple net lease environment. And if they don't upgrade it, they won't be. \n Now we have had some decrease in commercial. As Jason described, it's still a big part of what we do, still pretty profitable. Again, commercial for us has not been a new office building sector for a long time. Now we will go in and do tenant bid-out work, multiple floors for high-end clients, like some of you listening to this call. We will do that work. But -- and also, the decrease mainly was some of the logistical work we were doing for large dry good distribution centers. That would be both electrical and fire or life safety. \n But we have seen an increase in cold storage warehouses, which are smaller in dollar award that require actually a higher skill for us to do, both from a mechanical -- especially some of the refrigerant work on that, and fire or life safety. \n So you put all that together and you look at the right-hand -- left-hand side, we're up in domestic construction substantially, $1.2 billion over year. We're up in Building Services. And industrial has good bookings in its shop work. \n So now what does that lead you to do? You go to Page 11, which is what most of you care about. We had this robust performance. You got to look at it and say, what are you going to do? Well, we're going to increase guidance, right? And we're going to -- we're executing exceptionally well, really better than we ever have. We have really strong mix in our RPOs. We're winning the right work in the right markets. They're significant projects that are technically complex with accelerated timelines and scope expansion and more reasonable contract terms, especially in our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments. \n As a result of that, our EPS guidance range is going to go from $14 to $15 per share, to $15.50 to $16.50 per share. We're also going to increase our revenue guidance from a range of $13.5 billion to $14 billion, to $14 billion to $14.5 billion. \n In order to achieve the end of this revised guidance range, we got to keep executing with discipline and precision, the results and strong operating margin. And what we're telling you on this call to save you asking the question, in this guidance, we plan on operating the business this year between 7% and 7.5% operating margins. \n We're going to continue to face challenges. We talked about one today. We're going to continue to face challenges, both in our site-based business in the U.S. and U.K. We'll work through those. We've shown we can do that. \n Macro factors, such as high interest rates, supply chain, energy price disruptions, global conflicts, they're all going to post challenges for us. I'd like to say that we haven't done all that in the past and been good at it, but we are. We will develop contingency plans. We have them, we develop them every day. And we execute as best as we can to overcome these challenges. \n We're also going to remain diligent in those that are more exposed, especially to high interest rates. And for us, that means our commercial real estate and private equity customers. \n We're going to continue to be balanced capital allocators and invest in organic growth as well as strategic acquisitions. We've already done more acquisitions year-to-date this year than we have in the last 2 years and -- individually in those years. And we already really like what we've done because it continues to build the business for the long term and serve our customers better. \n Finally -- by the way, our acquisition pipeline is robust. And you would expect that. I'm going to get into that, I'll save you the question. Why is it robust? Because people are doing better after the pandemic, right? People -- good companies aren't for sale when they're not doing well. They become for sale when they're doing well. In the markets we're serving, they're doing well. Also maybe not as well as we are, but they're doing well. And so that's when companies become for sale. \n And like I've always said 1,000 times over, never fall in love with a deal, and deals happen when they happen. I've done this long enough that I don't fall in love with deals. Maybe I did that 20 years ago. \n Finally, I want to thank all of the EMCOR leaders and teammates for their hard work and dedication to serving our customers, primarily in a safe and productive way. We put safety first as one of our core values. \n Personally, I'm grateful to lead such an outstanding team. We do lead our company through our EMCOR values and mission first, people always. And we're going to be continuing to be focused on executing our mission for our customers and shareholders while keeping EMCOR a great place to work for all employees. \n With that, Marliese, I'll turn it over to you and take any questions you may have. I don't know how to parse the second one really as far as mega jobs versus -- but we're seeing demand being pretty strong across it. My general view on some of the high-tech manufacturing areas that have been built, you think about there's probably 6 semiconductor or 7 semiconductor markets. They've been semiconductor markets. There is a rebirth in some of those markets. \n The only real new one is the one in outside Syracuse in Clay, New York. The other one is where the business happened, right? It was happening in Phoenix before. It was happening in Austin, Texas before. It was happening -- Columbus, Ohio was new also, I guess. But I think Intel has been thinking of expanding. Boise, Idaho was happening before. Salt Lake City was happening before. Oregon was happening before. So these for the most part, other than maybe 2 markets, have been well-established markets. Even Raleigh, North Carolina. I mean, Wolfspeed, which is one of the customers -- that was Cree one time, and Cree did semiconductors for their lighting products and decided just to focus on semiconductors. \n So I think a lot of it would be happening anyway. I think they realized they were too exposed to the supply chain. The supply chain had to move more to the U.S. It's pretty obvious why you can't -- if you're a Taiwan semiconductor, why you just can't be in Taiwan. It's both a diversification. It's what any responsible business would do. \n Intel is investing for their next generation. I mean, Intel was not cash-poor, neither is Samsung, neither is Micron. These are very good companies that know how to invest through a cycle. \n Now what have the government incentives done? Well, they've done a couple of things, right? I think they've helped strengthen commitment to a site. I think they've also sort of put some rules around how the work will get done and with what kind of people and what kind of trade skill, which is very high trade skill, which was probably going to happen anyway because you need the kind of people that we're privileged to have here at EMCOR and working with us to do those kind of jobs. \n But I think it lengthens it and it makes it less turbulent as far as how it will get built out because I think there's a fairly significant surety of supply in national security play. And then you combine that with the need for AI chips, they have a market, right? \n Now there's been a lot of talk when you get to that specific market, is are they stopping? Are they starting? Pauses and stops and maybe our award sizes won't be so big. But the sites we're working on today, we feel really good, are long-term sites. We have a couple more we're helping start the infrastructure on. We'll see what happens there. So that one we feel good about it. \n You get to the broader industrial, this was happening. It was just starting to happen pre-COVID. It's why we invested in the Southeast from 2008 to 2020 through acquisition and then organic expansion and building capability. And we have some great companies down there, right? I mean these are market leaders led by really strong teams, and we're a destination employer. \n But people are bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. Why now? Part of it was energy before. We were lower-cost energy. I'm not going to get into all the scenario around why we're not as lower cost as we were at one time. But we're also a more safe market. And quite frankly, the logistical challenges and the cost advantages of being in China and Southeast Asia aren't what they once were. And so -- and then with automation, when you bring it back, you can have better supply. \n And then you think about what happened with COVID. I said this before, I used to be a manufacturer, right? So -- and I used to do a lot of work around manufacturing in a previous life. We started with we always wanted 2 suppliers for most of our critical components, right, if you go back 25 years. And then we said, \"Okay, well, maybe we don't need to do that for the critical components. We at least need our key suppliers to be doing that out of 2 factories.\" And then we got sloppy over the last 10 years, and we said, \"Well, we can have one supplier out of one factory, and we'll be okay, and that doesn't matter whether that was in Mexico or China or Eastern Europe.\" That didn't turn out to be okay, right? \n And now we're back to building supply chain redundancy. And the natural catching point for that supply chain redundancy is the U.S., and that's mainly centered in the mid-central places like Indiana, the Southeast and Texas, quite frankly. And so we feel really bullish about that. \n Look, there'll be ups and downs. Maybe the awards won't be as large in the future, but we're well entrenched with some key customers and some key sites to deliver great results for them on really sophisticated projects. Yes, I'm going to -- I never talk about go-forward margins. We always think about it in bands and we always think about it over sort of 8 quarters, looking back. But it wasn't all that too long ago in the first quarter of 2022, not to bring up a more challenging time for us, where we had, through supply chain, a lot of jobs stalled in the Electrical sector. And we weren't earning the margins. I think we earned 6% margin or high 5s that quarter. And external folks' hairs were on fire, and we sort of knew what the drivers were. And I would say those drivers flipped this quarter, right? \n So the drivers of why we didn't do well, it had nothing to do with execution in the field. We -- maybe we had a little unproductive labor because we kept people and we were waiting for jobs, that didn't start up, to start up. We had some supply chain stalls that caused that. And then that caused people to delay the site conditions and the buildup. And so we did the right thing. We kept our powder dry. We kept some of our key labor, especially supervision, because we knew we were going to begin on the work. \n I would say the opposite happened this quarter. We had near-flawless execution in our Electrical business on a really good mix of work that led to these results. Is it always going to be this good? Probably not. But we have a really good Electrical business, led in the field by really capable people with a great segment team. \n Yes, Jason? If you looked at our electrical team and our mechanical team and say, what do they actually focus on? They look at the operating margin in a given quarter as an output metric. So what are they focused on? The inputs, right? How productive is the labor on a job? How safe is that labor on a job? How much portion of the job we've been able to put through our VDC process, which is prefab, BIM modeling? How successful we've been in negotiating the contract to have constructive discussions as scope expands? \n They're looking at the input metrics, right? And then they're looking at the absorption they're getting on their overhead as they do this work. And that leads to great results. I mean I think they look at the end of the quarter and look down at the results, hey, that's pretty good. But they're back to focusing on the input metrics. I don't think it will, at least in our guidance. Jason, you agree? Or -- and if you think about the input side of that, we're doing a really good job on resource allocation. And that extends -- obviously, you see it in the construction segment over the last several quarters. But quite frankly, you're also seeing it in Building Services because of what's happening in Mechanical Services and building controls, right? The mix there is very good also. \n And look, the industrial team also has focused the mix in a good direction, whether it's how they manage the mix within their shops, of the 5 shops we have, how they think about their field resources and how they do that versus some of the specialty services we have versus the turnaround. \n And then quite frankly, we're pretty excited about some of the things we have going on in our Electrical business and then how they think about mix there. When you have really precious resources like we have, and for us, that really means supervision, shop capability, VDC capability, project engineers, project managers, we think hard and long about what we're going to commit to over a long period of time and what's more attractive. And quite frankly, what's happening with us, we're winning, right? Our customers are choosing us because we deliver for them. Most of it is at the subsidiary and segment level. We -- for lack of a better word, we, at the segment and corporate level think, we put out our intent. We think about markets, we think about where is the best place for us to allocate our resources, how we're going to allocate them. \n But our fighting unit, quite frankly at EMCOR, is our subsidiaries, and they're good. And then within those subsidiaries, right, we think about which subsidiaries get more investment versus other subsidiaries because of the opportunities that are in front of them. \n And it's a very thoughtful process. We have very sophisticated business leaders at the subsidiary level, supported by great relationships whether -- with labor, whether it's union or nonunion, with superintendents and project foreman and project managers. And they look at their playing field and say, what's the best way to allocate these resources to derive the best results for our company, their people; the best results for our customers; and to build something that's sustainable in these markets based on the opportunities they see in front of them. And for us, that's usually a 6- to 24-month planning horizon at the subsidiary level and then thinking about how that builds capability. \n So look, what makes a great data center builder makes a good complex project builder that can do things under pressure with a fast timeline with a demanding customer. A lot of markets that look like that, but you have to build that capability. \n And then what we do a really good job of, and this is where our segment teams do an exceptional job of, how do you -- you don't move the people for a long period of time, but how do you peer learn? Peer learning at EMCOR is a big deal. So I talked about the expansion into other markets that we've done. It's not like we -- every place that we expanded into a data center market, we didn't have a company. It's just they weren't serving a data center market. And so the team or the electrical team said, \"Okay, we do this really well. Why can't we do it here? And when we do it here, this is how we have to think about let's go way back here to estimating. So we'll work together on the estimate. And then how do we think about building the VDC capability? How do we think about prefab in that market? What does schedule start to look like?\" \n Because we're going to make a commitment to a customer we probably have in another market to tell them now we can do that in this market. And for our guys, that's a pretty high bar to jump over, to have them trained up and ready to go. And that's how our folks think about it. That's one example that's happening every day across our company. We don't take work we don't think we can execute. That's true. But I wouldn't -- I've heard other people say, \"Hey, we're turning away work.\" I don't think that would be true here. I think we think about what we're going to bid. And when we bid the work or estimate the work or work in partnership with our customers to think about taking the work, we're pretty sure we can execute it. And we may not win it all the time. We don't. We don't have everything that we want to win. \n But I wouldn't call it a speed governor, but we very much don't try to outrun our headlights, right? We try to stay within our capability. Where do contractors don't do well is where they don't have the capability to do a job, they grow beyond the capabilities and they lack the execution resources. So the way we build capability and build capacity is someone that had been an assistant project manager or assistant project engineer, a regular foreman, now can become a general foreman, maybe help us get another superintendent out on the field which allows us to build more labor force. And then that assistant project manager now can run their own work a year, 1.5 years later with the right training. And then we can build that capability. \n Or if we're going to expand in another market. So maybe one of our electricals that have done a pretty -- a lot of industrial work, we take that person and say, \"Okay, here's what's different between that work and data center work. Or here's what's different between that work and semiconductor work. And this is the things you need to be aware of.\" And they work with other EMCOR companies to understand those nuances. \n But I would say, yes, our governor is our capacity to build skill and -- it's not cash. It's not capital investment. It's building the human capital and acquiring the human capital and training that we feel comfortable we can expand the company. I think it's pretty good. I mean, you read the same things we've done. We've done a lot of work on that. I think it's pretty good. I mean, we don't see any slowdown. And the thing that will constrain it, but then we'll fix that, we always do, people, is there will be more investment in the energy infrastructure, and then they'll keep growing. And there's nothing in the near term that suggests that's a problem, though. No. That's not true. We just reallocate our resources. So we were very good at -- in the fire or life safety world, at large big box retail distribution centers. That slowed down on the dry goods side. That -- they're very capable people. We moved that capability to other places like battery plants, like semiconductor plants, through training, through a very careful, do in once, do it right, and get it right. We have a great team there, and we build that. \n So yes, there's slowdowns. I mean, there are certain markets -- I don't think the New York guys are running around spiking the ball in the end zone right now. They're working hard, and they're doing fine. But you wouldn't say that's a booming market. There's no Hudson Yards. There's none of that happening right now. \n Maybe a little slowdown in the Northeast overall, but that's been overcome by other parts of the country. I mean, nothing is always up and to the right, as you know, Adam. I mean, commercial, yes, we're not really in the light commercial business in any significant way, even in Building Services other than some of the maintenance contracts. So yes, I mean, we have our share of challenges. But luckily, we have more good than those challenges right now. \n Jason, do you have anything to add? Thanks. Now look, Alex, the reality is we're every day trying to figure out that impact on our ongoing margins versus more favorable contract terms. I would say most of our margin enhancement is coming from execution. I mean, any job we do, there's plenty of competition. I mean, there's other people that know how to do this work. And so I never sit there and think about -- we have very capable competitors in every business that we have. So we're earning margins because we're earning them. \n And it's hard to separate. I would say this in general, right? The place where you have a multiyear build, like some of these data center markets or semiconductor markets or even the manufacturing sites, where you have a multiyear build, you get better. Your people get better, they get more productive. We think of better ways to do it. \n And if the mix of contracts skew more for us towards fixed price versus GMP with a fee, then we do better. If we can convert more GMP to fixed price, that's good for us and the owner because we have certainty -- they have certainty of cost. And somewhere 50%, 60% along the way, we also have certainty of outcome. Or we think we do. \n So it's hard to separate some of that stuff. I will tell you this, though, right? The more work we can do in the shop versus in the field, the better we do. The more we can get in the planning earlier with our VDC, the virtual design construct, and implement more of those tools, the earlier we can do that, the better off we work. \n And so I'll just give you a broad number. And we have -- we were probably around 500 VDC people, mainly BIM operators in 2019, end of '18. Today, that number is 1,500. Now you could draw a correlation between that and our margin increase. I think that's part of it, that we're doing more. \n And it goes beyond prefab. A lot of times, we simplify VDC to prefab, but it goes way beyond that. It goes to -- we have a couple of people that are really good. You start to build things in 4D or parametric, right? And what you're doing is you're finding the mistakes before you go to the site. And if you can find the mistakes before you go to the site and the collisions and all the things that are going to go wrong, then you perform better, right? \n The most frustrating thing in the world for a foreman or a trade person or project engineer, project manager is to have installed something and then have to take it out or have someone take your work out because they didn't get it right. And our people don't like rework even if we get paid for it. That's not -- you got folks are really proud of the work. \n Quality also goes up, right, with VDC, whether it's field installed or whether it's shop. Because, again, if you went to a construction site today, and it's almost any site, even the smaller projects, our guys for the most part are looking at something on an iPad or a workstation. And they're looking at what they're going to build in 3 dimensions on that iPad. And they visually see what they're going to build and what it should look like versus trying to read it in 2 dimensions just off a drawing. \n And our technology has seeped through the organization, and we really have taken the tools. Now we just take tools to make them better. We don't self-develop any of these tools because there's good tools out there. But we've really taken leadership of that. \n And we have a dedicated group that does that now in our construction segment. The two work together on electrical, mechanical. It's not that different. The mechanical is probably a little more complex and advanced than the electrical folks on this because think about there's flows happening, there's systems. Where the electrical is, it's more rigidity, conduit and runs, right? But both are doing more of it. \n And with electrical guys think about when they do VDC is, how do I take something I'm going to do 100 times and take that work out of the field so there's less connections and the connection is easier. That's broadly speaking how they think about it. \n And then we're doing more skids and assemblies in both mechanical and electrical. And again, that makes it more rigorous. It makes it more stable when it gets to the field and be able to be built. \n So I'd say is it half of why we're doing better productivity? Sure. And then some of it is just working better because we've done these jobs multiple times. And look, EMCOR is a wonderful peer learning environment. So that's the construction side. \n When you get to the smaller project, Mechanical Service side, it's a little different. There, when you're doing a project a lot of times, productivity is almost secondary to making sure you don't disrupt the owner. And then it becomes a logistical game because you're usually operating in a build site, right? So they got to keep working. And so our guys have to really understand that, get the logistics right, get that in and get the building up right. \n So when you're doing a retrofit project, especially a midsized to medium-sized and smaller one, there, you're thinking about how do I make my customer more productive when I do it? And then how do I make sure that I've covered all my contingencies when I have to do these very complex logistical jobs in a build site? So that's a long-winded answer to what you were searching for, but... Maybe, Jason, talk a little bit about how CapEx moved here and how do we build or build infrastructure or things like that. But all our investments, someone asked the question earlier about are these top-down or are they bottom-up? They're bottom-up, but there's a receptive knowledgeable ear at the top to ascertain where the best way to invest, and also to provide resources when needed, to help them invest. \n We haven't turned down a significant capital investment here in 5 years. I only say 5 years because I don't remember before that, because our folks bring these forward, they tend to be very well thought. And they take a -- and as a contractor, just so we understand that, too, our folks are looking for less than 4-year cash payback when they make that infrastructure investment because we do think like contractors, right? \n We're looking at the current market and say, \"This is good for today, it'll be good for the future. But let's make sure we can earn today.\" And the other thing is we -- 95% I always qualify things, probably it's 100%, but 95% of our prefabrication is for us in our jobs. We don't prefabricate for the market. I'd say yes and no, right? Yes in that we have pretty good visibility in that we understand they're going to do the work. But they could shift it from fourth quarter to first quarter or third quarter to fourth quarter. \n I would say that I had the privilege of seeing the kind of relationships our folks have firsthand recently at one of the biggest refining customers. And they're at the top, and they're deep. Why? Because we help that customer perform and solve problems. And ultimately, that's what that business comes down to. You have to have the best technical resources. \n And the good news I take away from what I've seen recently in that business is there's a little straining for manpower going on right now. And when that happens in the Gulf Coast, that's usually a good thing. It means that there's more activity going on. And when there's more activity going on, that's good for the larger contractors like us. Look, we got off to a good start this year. It's been a -- we've been performing really well. I don't think you can ever discount the skill it takes of our folks in the field. You heard me talk about it earlier. \n And someone asked me an interesting question today. Are these decisions being made top-down at the segment level, subsidiary level? I'd say it's a team sport. But at the end of the day, we're only as good as our subsidiaries deliver on the projects that they commit to our customers. \n And with that, I'll thank them, and see you all in a couple of months. Bye."

            "name": "Jason Nalbandian",
            "content": "Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Over the next several slides, I'll review our operating performance for each of our segments as well as some of the key financial data for the first quarter of 2024 in comparison to the first quarter of 2023. \n I'm going to start on Slide 5, which is revenues. As Tony mentioned, consolidated revenues were $3.43 billion, an increase of $541.8 million or 18.7%. Each of our domestic reportable segments experienced year-over-year increases in revenue, and with organic growth of 18.5%, substantially all of this growth was organic. \n If we look at each of our segments. Revenues of U.S. Electrical Construction were $764.7 million, an increase of 18.6%. This segment continues to benefit from growth across many of the market sectors in which we participate with the most significant revenue growth in network and communications, which is predominantly our data center projects. The increased need for cloud computing, data storage and the emergence of AI have accelerated the demand for these services. \n Revenues in U.S. Mechanical Construction were $1.4 billion, increasing 32.4%, with revenue growth across the majority of the market sectors in which we operate. While the most significant growth occurred in the high-tech manufacturing market sector, we also saw notable increases in manufacturing, industrial, institutional and network and communications. \n As we've mentioned on previous calls, as a result of projects for customers engaged in the design and manufacturing of semiconductors as well as the production and development of electric vehicles and related battery technologies, this segment is experiencing strong demand for both its traditional mechanical services as well as our fire and life safety offerings. \n Coupled with the continued build-out of hyperscale data centers and domestic near-shoring and reshoring, these trends continue to be the driving factors behind the segment's significant organic revenue growth. Together, our domestic construction segments generated revenues of $2.2 billion, an increase of just over 27%. \n If we move to U.S. Building Services, revenues grew 7.7% or 6.6% organically to $781.2 million. The most significant growth in this segment was generated by our Mechanical Services division. We continue to benefit from strong demand for HVAC projects and retrofits as well as building automation and control services. In addition, we're experiencing service volume growth due in part to an expanded customer base. \n Looking at U.S. Industrial Services. Revenues were $354 million, increasing 7% year-over-year. With contracts of a more typical size, we executed against a more normal turnaround season and benefited from scope expansion on certain of these projects. This segment additionally benefited from increased demand for certain renewable fuel projects within the quarters. \n And lastly on this slide. Revenues of $104.7 million for our U.K. Building Services segment was exceptional despite a tough operating environment which has led to lower facilities maintenance and discretionary project revenues. \n If we turn to Slide 6, you can see operating income for the quarter was $260 million or 7.6% of revenues. This compares favorably to operating income of just under $155 million or 5.4% of revenues a year ago. A more favorable mix of work and exceptional project execution continue to be the drivers of our improved performance. \n Once again, if we look at each of our segments, U.S. Electrical Construction is reporting operating income of $91.6 million, which represents a 126% increase; an operating margin of 12%, which is a 570 basis point improvement. Increased gross profit and gross profit margin were the primary drivers of this performance, with the most notable increases in gross profit within network and communications, commercial, and manufacturing and industrial. \n Operating income for U.S. Mechanical Construction was $150.7 million, an increase of nearly 75%. And operating margin of 10.6% represents a 260 basis point improvement. This segment experienced increases in gross profit from the majority of the market sectors in which we operate with the most notable contribution being generated within the high-tech manufacturing and commercial market sectors. \n I should also point out that in addition to increased gross profit margin, the operating margin of each of our construction segments benefited from a reduction in SG&A margin as we leveraged our overhead cost structure during this period of growth. Together, our domestic construction segments earned operating margin of 11.1%. \n Operating income for U.S. Building Services was $33.5 million or 4.3% of revenues. While revenues and gross profit of this segment both exceeded that of the prior year, operating income and operating margin decreased by $4 million and 90 basis points. \n Unfortunately, a customer bankruptcy within our commercial site-based services division more than offset the increased profitability generated by our Mechanical Services group during the quarter. This bankruptcy negatively impacted operating income and operating margin of this segment by $11 million and 140 basis points. \n Moving to Industrial Services. Operating income was $18 million or 5.1% of revenues, representing an increase in operating income of 19.6% and a 60 basis point improvement in operating margin. In addition to a slight increase in gross profit margin, this segment benefited from greater overhead absorption, given the increase in quarterly revenues previously mentioned. \n And lastly, U.K. Building Services is reporting operating income of $5.4 million or 5.1% of revenues. Despite a reduction in quarterly revenues of this segment, operating income is in line with that of the prior year and operating margin has improved by 20 basis points, as we continue to optimize our project and service mix while seeking to more effectively leverage the overhead cost structure of this segment. \n Let's turn to Slide 7. We've covered most of this slide already, but I did want to briefly look at SG&A and diluted earnings per share. If we start with SG&A, as I mentioned while reviewing the operating performance of our segments, we were successful in leveraging our overhead cost structure, as evidenced by the 10 basis point reduction in SG&A margin from 9.7% to 9.6%. But I should also point out that somewhat masking our SG&A leverage is the provision we took for the customer bankruptcy within U.S. Building Services, which negatively impacted our consolidated SG&A margin by 40 basis points. \n And moving to EPS. Diluted earnings per share was $4.17, a nearly 80% increase compared to $2.32 in Q1 of 2023. This EPS performance, like many of our first quarter financial metrics, established a new record for EMCOR for a first quarter. \n And finally, if we turn to Slide 8, the strength of EMCOR's balance sheet continues to be a differentiator for us in the market, providing our customers with confidence as we bid on large-scale, complex and demanding projects. Given the size and strength of our balance sheet, including $841 million of cash on hand and $1.2 billion of capacity available to us under our revolving credit facility, coupled with our significant cash generation, we remain well positioned to fund organic growth, pursue strategic M&A and return capital to shareholders. \n Although not shown on this slide, operating cash flow for the quarter was $132.3 million, which represents approximately 50% of operating income. As I mentioned on last quarter's earnings call, on an annual basis, we do expect operating cash flow to be in line with a normalized historical average of between 75% to 80% of operating income or approximately equal to net income. \n And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Tony for a review of our RPO and market sectors. The only thing I would add there, right, is it truly is a combination of execution and mix in the quarter. There's no anomalies when we look at large project closeouts or project losses, anything to that effect really netted to near 0 in the quarter. So it truly is mix and execution. \n I think 12% is a record quarterly operating margin for Electrical. So I wouldn't necessarily say that, that's the new norm. I think to Tony's point, it makes sense to look at it over a 15- to 18-month period, and that's probably something we can expect to see from Electrical in the near term. Yes. And I think, right, when you look at our guidance, as Tony said, margins for the year between 7% and 7.5%, right? I think the thing to remember is 7% margins will be equivalent to what we did on an annual basis in 2023, which was a record. And 7.5% margin is really our trailing 12-month average margin. And so I think what we're saying there is that mix we expect for the remainder of the year is consistent with the mix we've seen in the last 12 months. Thank you. I think you covered it, Tony. I think the only thing I would add, you asked specifically about investments in certain markets or different sectors. And I think, right, none of these investments are targeted at a single market sector, right? The same prefabrication facility that can do a high-tech manufacturing -- support a high-tech manufacturing project can support a health care project or any other sector that we're working in. And the same thing with VDC or BIM, right? It's not targeted at any subset of our work, other than more so to our construction side than our service side. In the quarter, relatively comparable year-over-year. And I think if you go to a full year of 2023, that's when you'd really see it compared to the full year of 2022. I think our CapEx was up roughly 60%, and that really was a lot of these investments that Tony has been talking about. And we'll continue to invest in prefab facilities. We'll continue to invest in BIM. We'll expand the facilities that we have where we need more capacity. And we'll find ways to add facilities in other markets where we currently don't have the same capacity we do elsewhere."
