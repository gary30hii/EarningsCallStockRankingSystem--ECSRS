My name is Emily, and I'll be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions].  I will now hand you over to our host, Josh Smith, Head of Investor Relations to begin. Josh, please go ahead.\nJosh Smith: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Corebridge Financial's fourth quarter earnings update. Joining me on the call are Kevin Hogan, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Elias Habayeb, Chief Financial Officer. We will begin with prepared remarks by Kevin and Elias, and then we will take your questions.  Today's remarks may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based upon management's current expectations. Corebridge's filings with the SEC provide details on important factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by the applicable Securities Laws, Corebridge is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change.  Additionally, today's remarks may refer to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at www.corebridgefinancial.com.  With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Kevin.\nKevin Hogan: Thank you, Josh, and good morning to everyone. During our call today, we will present our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results. I will speak to the competitive landscape, review the progress we are making on our core strategies, reinforce our commitment to our financial goals and discuss how Corebridge is well positioned to create long-term value for shareholders and other stakeholders. Elias will then deliver additional details on our financial results, offer a few comments on LDTI and provide some guidance for 2023.  Corebridge Financial had a strong debut in 2022, notwithstanding external conditions. We delivered operating earnings per share of $0.88 in the fourth quarter and $2.87 for the year. Our results for the fourth quarter and the full year demonstrate the resilience of our franchise and the competitive strengths of our businesses. Our diverse sources of earnings, our broad product platform and our unrivaled network of distribution partners remain strategic advantages for Corebridge, and position us to perform well in different market environments.  Our businesses grew in 2022 as we expanded our product range, enhanced customer solutions, advanced strategic initiatives and began to implement a leaner operating model, all while completing our initial public offering last September. We are well on the way toward creating sustainable, profitable and incremental growth while delivering on the strategies and financial goals we've previously outlined.  Adjusting for earnings volatility related to market conditions, such as from variable investment income, the earnings power of our core insurance businesses improved, aided by tailwinds from higher interest rates, wider credit spreads and favorable mortality, which more than offset headwinds from equity market performance. New money rates more than doubled this year, climbing to 7% in the fourth quarter, an increase of approximately 400 basis points. Over the last 12 months, base net investment spread expanded during the second half of the year, contributing to a healthy level of organic growth.  Looking at individual retirement, we delivered balanced sales with healthy margins and strong general account cash flows across our spread-based products. The breadth of our portfolio and the strength of our distribution partnerships helped us generate premiums and deposits of $3.8 billion in the fourth quarter contributing to $15.1 billion of new deposits over the course of 2022, with positive net flows of $2.4 billion, reflecting nearly 200% growth in net flows year-over-year.  In fixed annuity, we saw some of the best conditions in recent memory. At the same time, we remain disciplined, effectively balancing competitiveness and margin growth. We delivered sales of more than $1.3 billion in each quarter of 2022, contributing to $5.7 billion in premiums and deposits for full year 2022, an 89% increase year-over-year. This extraordinary level of new business reflects a strong appetite for fixed annuity products in the marketplace, combined with the strength of our bank distribution relationships.  Fixed index annuity also benefited from a very attractive landscape with $1.7 billion of premiums and deposits in the fourth quarter and over $6.3 billion for the full year. Full year net inflows were $4.5 billion. The strong position of this business is supported by our income and accumulation products, which we distribute across a broad range of channels.  In Group Retirement, premiums and deposits were also strong at nearly $2.2 billion for the fourth quarter or approximately $8 billion for the full year, supported by new planned acquisitions and growth of out-of-plan deposits, in particular, in fixed annuities. These out-of-plan deposits reflect one part of our broader strategy for this business, which includes serving individuals outside of their traditional employer-sponsored retirement plans. And as a reminder, large new plant acquisitions or surrenders are nonlinear.  Thinking about retirement across group and individual, we were pleased the U.S. Congress was able to pass SECURE 2.0. This federal legislation is another important step in building a stronger retirement system and improving retirement outcomes for all Americans. We anticipate a positive impact from SECURE 2.0 across both our individual and group retirement businesses as this legislation should result in increased contributions, larger account balances and delayed withdrawals from retirement accounts.  Life Insurance generated stable premiums and deposits year-over-year as we continue to transform this business. Sales over the last year reflect our efforts to improve the mix of business in the U.S. and to grow the business in the UK. And in institutional markets, we closed pension risk transfer transactions totaling $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter. While premiums and deposits were lower in the fourth quarter and full year versus 2021, we continue to see a robust pipeline for full plan terminations in the U.S. and the UK.  We also remain confident in our ability to become a more consistent issuer of GICs in the future, subject to market conditions. Overall, I am very pleased with the performance of our businesses and the levels of organic growth we produced in spite of challenging market and industry conditions. We have a lot of momentum particularly since completing our IPO and we are well positioned to grow and continue to strengthen our relationships with distribution partners in the coming year.  Next, I will discuss the progress we are making to advance our investment partnerships and our efficiency strategies that I outlined during our third quarter earnings call. Our partnerships with Blackstone and BlackRock continued to benefit us as they each bring considerable resources to bear in support of our strategic initiatives.  Looking at Blackstone first, we continue to see great value from our growing relationship. Blackstone's asset sourcing capabilities have aided our product competitiveness as they are able to originate attractive assets at volumes we could not previously achieved. These assets are successfully supporting all four of our businesses. For the full year, Blackstone executed approximately $8 billion of new transactions across a variety of asset classes, including private and structured credit at an average gross yield of just over 6.5% and an average credit quality of single A.  The purchase yield on assets originated during the fourth quarter was 7.2%. We've been putting more money to work in private credit as we believe this asset class will generally perform better during a downturn due to the structural protections that are built into these transactions.  With respect to BlackRock, they are now managing approximately $83 billion of our invested assets, primarily focused on the public liquid credit portfolio. We also continue to make strides in our migration to BlackRock's Aladdin platform, which will further modernize our infrastructure and provide us with expanded analytics and accounting capabilities. We expect to be live on this platform in 2024.  Partnering with these world class asset managers greatly enhances our access to attractive assets but does not reflect the change to our investment strategy, risk appetite or asset allocation process. We own the balance sheet, and we will continue to direct asset allocation regardless of the source of origination. Our investment strategy has always been and will remain liability driven. Our diversified and high-quality investment portfolio is well matched to our liability profile.  Our risk appetite remains unchanged relative to our liabilities. We continue to actively manage both the performance and the risk of the entire portfolio, irrespective of origination and we are proactive in taking action on individual assets when appropriate. We believe we will be able to respond effectively to any changes in the credit cycle.  Now turning to Corebridge Forward, our modernization program that will deliver both expense reduction and increased efficiency. We have contracted on $232 million of exit run rate savings. This equates to more than 50% of our stated goal of $400 million of run rate savings over the next three years. Much of the exit run rate savings to date represent refinements to our operating model, enhanced outsourcing with existing partners, real estate consolidation opportunities and the early stages of our IT modernization, which will eventually lead to our ability to exit our data centers.  We continue to expect the majority of the run rate savings to earn in within 24 months of our IPO. Elias will provide more information in his remarks.  Turning to our financial goals, we remain focused on achieving each of the targets we outlined on our last earnings call as we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, deliver disciplined growth and provide an attractive return to shareholders. We maintain a clear line of sight toward achieving an ROE of 12% to 14%, and we remain committed to delivering capital to our shareholders through a combination of $600 million in annual dividends along with share repurchases, resulting in a 60% to 65% payout ratio on adjusted after-tax operating income. We are on target to achieve these goals within 24 months of our IPO.  Before turning the call over to Elias, I would like to add a few comments about our commitment to creating shareholder and broader stakeholder value. As I look back on 2022, market conditions were challenging. Our team demonstrated an ability to respond, leveraging our unique platform to maximize opportunities as they arose. While 2023 remains uncertain and volatile, we are well positioned to deliver to customers, shareholders and our other stakeholders.  Our broad diversification across products and channels continues to serve us well as we are not dependent upon a single product or distribution channel. We remain nimble and we'll pursue profitable growth by focusing on areas where risk-adjusted returns are the most attractive in our new business growth as this is most accretive to our operating earnings. While we have recently been emphasizing capital deployment to our spread-based businesses, our fee-based business remains healthy and is poised to benefit when asset values recover and investor appetite rebounds.  To summarize, the core strengths of Corebridge, coupled with changes to our operating model and the execution of our strategic initiatives position us to continue to generate attractive financial results under various scenarios. This, in combination with our active capital management strategy puts us in a position to create long-term shareholder value.  I will now turn the call over to Elias.\nElias Habayeb: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. I'll provide additional information about our financial results and key performance metrics as well as a few updates on LDTI and some high level guidance for 2023.  We reported fourth quarter results and full year results this morning, boosted by improving base spread income and favorable mortality experience, notwithstanding recent market conditions. And we continue to make meaningful progress on our strategic initiatives to improve profitability.  Fourth quarter adjusted ROE was 10.6%, operating EPS was $0.88, and adjusted pretax operating income, or APTOI, was $639 million. Our results included several notable items that contributed $0.16 to our operating EPS. These were offset by alternative returns below long term expectations of $0.12 and COVID mortality losses of $0.03. Adjusting for these items, our operating EPS would have been $0.87 for the quarter.  With respect to APTOI, our results were 31% or $287 million below the prior year quarter. Approximately $635 million of this decline was driven by the impact of market conditions and structural changes associated with debt capitalization of Corebridge as well as divestitures completed in 2021. The principal headwind was variable investment income, which accounted for nearly $490 million of the decline.  Excluding variable investment income, APTOI was 48% higher than the fourth quarter of 2021, largely due to increasing base spread income and improving mortality experience. Assets under management and administration was $357 billion as of December 31, up 3% sequentially, reflecting both market conditions and new business growth.  The strength and diversification of our core earnings power is evident when you look at our sources of income for the fourth quarter, which, in aggregate, were up 15% year-over-year, excluding variable investment income. Base spread income, which is our largest source of earnings, grew 25% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 due to higher new money rates coupled with strong growth in our spread-based products.  Fee income, our second largest source of earnings declined 20% versus the prior year quarter partially a function of underlying asset valuations. Underwriting margin, which is primarily derived from our life business, rose 91% year-over-year, excluding variable investment income, mainly due to improving mortality experience.  Shifting to net investment income, base yield was 4.42% in the fourth quarter. This was the second quarter in a row where we saw significant growth with a base yield up 34 basis points sequentially and 54 basis points year-over-year. This growth was driven by a combination of reinvestment activity at higher new money rates, resets on floating rate assets and growth of the overall portfolio as well as a onetime notable item. This notable item contributed 15 basis points to the base yield, most of which benefited our Life Insurance segment.  To reiterate my comments during last quarter's call, we expect the benefit of higher new money rates and our partnership with Blackstone to continue to emerge during future quarters as more of the investment portfolio is reinvested at higher yields and earns in. Thus far, the improvement in base yield has outweighed any increases in policyholder crediting rates.  Moving on to expenses, total operating expenses increased sequentially on a net basis. While our fixed cost benefits from Corebridge Forward activity, they were more than offset by incremental costs that kicked in with our IPO, continued establishment of standalone capabilities as well as a onetime item.  Following up on Kevin's earlier comments about Corebridge Forward, we have a roadmap for $400 million of expense savings, and we have acted upon or contracted approximately $232 million of exit run rate savings as of the end of 2022. Only a small percentage of these savings have earned into our results thus far. We expect that approximately $130 million will earn in, in 2023, with an offset from the full year earn-in effect from incremental costs that we picked up during 2022 to operate a standalone public company, which we estimate at $75 million to $100 million.  We continue to estimate the cost to achieve will approximate $300 million over the life of the initiative, with this onetime investment delivering $400 million in annual run rate savings. So far, the cost to achieve has been $84 million. We continue to expect the implementation of a leaner operating model will contribute approximately one point to ROE growth by 2024.  We also made significant strides separating Corebridge from AIG. To-date, we've incurred about $180 million of the $350 million to $450 million estimated cost to achieve. The bulk of the remaining work is centered around separating shared applications which should largely be completed by the end of 2023 or early '24.  Next, I will speak to segment results, beginning with Individual Retirement, our largest business. Individual Retirement reported APTOI of $436 million, benefiting from strong growth in base spread income as well as overall lower expenses, partially offset by lower fee income. Base spread income for the quarter was up 35% over the prior year quarter, driven by spread expansion. Base net investment spreads increased 54 basis points year-over-year and 27 basis points sequentially.  Fee income declined 21% due to lower asset valuations and net outflows in our variable annuity portfolio. Our hedging programs continued to perform as expected despite volatile market conditions. The higher rates that have been driving our strong sales at attractive margins are as expected, also leading to higher surrenders. That being said, our surrender rate remains below our expectation and net inflows in the general account were quite strong at $740 million in the fourth quarter and over $4 billion for all of 2022.  In addition, we maintained strong liquidity in the general account, well positioning us to cover surrenders which we expect will remain elevated in 2023 relative to historical levels due to the materially higher interest rate and credit spread environment.  Group Retirement has been influenced by many of the same trends impacting Individual Retirement. Group Retirement reported APTOI of $177 million, benefiting from strong growth in base spread income, offset by lower fee income. Base spread income grew 13% versus the fourth quarter of 2021 due to spread expansion. Base net investment spread increased 17 basis points year-over-year but was flat sequentially.  Fee income declined 20% year-over-year due to lower asset valuations and net outflows. While net flows remain negative, we continue to see outflows concentrated in the higher GMIR bucket with inflows in the lower GMIR buckets. This trend is expected to improve the spread profile for the business over time.  We expect continued growth of our advisory and brokerage fee revenue, which reflects our strategy to pivot the business into a platform which provides for a higher stream of less captive incentive cash flows over time.  Life Insurance reported APTOI of $97 million in the fourth quarter inclusive of $22 million of notable items. Core underwriting margin, excluding notable items, improved 78% year-over-year due to improved mortality experience. Our fourth quarter mortality experience was favorable to expectation, inclusive of $21 million of COVID losses.  Notable items in Life Insurance included approximately $64 million of a onetime item in net investment income, offset by $42 million related to the positive resolution of certain legal matters. The legal matters included a recapture of certain YRT treaties that were subject to arbitration as well as the resolution of an unrelated litigation matter. We have now resolved a majority of our YRT disputes.  Considering this business more broadly and looking forward, we expect continued growth of base portfolio income and a reversion to historical mortality levels as COVID moves into an endemic phase. Institutional markets reported APTOI of $64 million in the fourth quarter with stable core sources of income as compared to the prior year quarter. The year-over-year decline in APTOI was largely driven by lower variable investment income.  Total insurance reserves grew 8% year-over-year, reflecting the growth of our PRT business and gate [ph] portfolio. We're encouraged by the progression of the institutional markets business, reflecting consistent revenue growth -- sorry, reserve growth, strong new business margins and expanding spreads, which we expect will continue to improve profitability in 2023.  And lastly, losses in our Corporate and Other segment increased sequentially due to higher interest expense, resulting from a full quarter of debt service on hybrid securities and the delayed draw term loan, which was drawn down in the third quarter 2022.  Turning to our balance sheet, we assess the strength of our balance sheet through different lenses including, but not limited to liquidity levels, capital ratios, financial leverage and our risk profile. Our balance sheet remains healthy with strong liquidity and capital as well as a balanced diversified investment portfolio and reasonable financial leverage as of December 31.  Adjusted book value was $21.4 billion or $33.10 per share, up 9% year-over-year, but down 2% from the third quarter. The sequential decline was due to derivative and foreign exchange mark-to-market losses in the fourth quarter that partially reversed gains from the first nine months of the year.  Our financial leverage ratio was 29.6%, within our target range. We continue to expect that our balance sheet will naturally delever over time as a result of book value growth. Our Life Fleet RBC ratio remained strong and was above target of 400%, largely aligned with the prior year quarter estimate -- prior quarter estimate. Recognizing there's a lot of uncertainty in the macro environment, we feel we're starting 2023 in a strong position.  We ended the year with ample holding company liquidity of $1.5 billion. Our insurance companies returned $2.2 billion of normalized distribution during 2022 on par with the distributions made in each of the preceding three years. We paid dividends to our shareholders of approximately $300 million since the IPO. We declared our dividend for the first quarter of 2023, which will be paid on March 31. This represents a dividend yield over 4% based upon our recent stock price.  As Kevin previously indicated, we remain focused on delivering on our financial goals, including achieving a total payout ratio of 60% to 65% by 2024.  Pivoting to LDTI, it's important to remember that LTI [ph] does not impact our economic returns, statutory results or insurance company cash flows. When we begin reporting under LDTI in 2023, we expect to see reduced volatility in our operating results given changes to the accounting for market risk benefits impact. The impact to our operating earnings run rate should be neutral to modestly favorable over time.  We expect continued volatility in our GAAP earnings due to the requirement to fair value market risk benefits in our GAAP results. We also expect an increase in adjusted book value which we currently estimate to approximate $1.5 billion as of September 30, 2022.  In terms of the initial transition adjustment as of January 1, 2021, we currently estimate an approximate $1 billion to $1.5 billion reduction in GAAP shareholders' equity resulting from a decline in other comprehensive income, offset by an increase in retained earnings. We further estimate the overall impact to GAAP shareholders' equity as of September 30, 2022, is an increase of approximately $1 billion. This favorable impact to book value reflects the benefit of Corporate having a diversified balance sheet, including both life and annuity products.  In terms of sensitivities to macro factors, our preliminary estimate of the APTOI impact from movements in equities and interest rates post LDTI are as follows. First, an immediate 10% reduction in equities is expected to reduce fee income net of advisory fee expense by approximately $85 million over a 12 month period. And second, an immediate upward parallel shift of 100 basis points across the treasury curve is expected to raise APTOI by approximately $165 million, $265 million and $365 million for each of the first, second and third years following the rate increase.  Now I would like to conclude with a commentary on our outlook for 2023. Looking ahead, we expect to achieve EPS growth resulting from our initiatives involving expense savings, investments, organic growth and capital management. As to our sources of income over the next 12 months, we expect to see incremental growth in base spread income and underwriting margins, while fee income will depend on the extent of a recovery in asset valuations.  We continue to expect long-term return assumptions for our alternative investments will range between 8% and 9%. And finally, we expect our effective tax rate will approximate 21% in 2023 before discrete items.  In summary, we remain focused on executing our strategies and deploying capital in a way that aids our efforts to create sustainable and profitable long-term growth. We have a strong balance sheet, and we remain focused on delivering on our financial goals.  I will now hand it back to Kevin.\nKevin Hogan : Thank you, Elias. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Ryan Krueger with KBW. Ryan, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRyan Krueger : Hi, thanks good morning. Yesterday, on the AIG call, they indicated a possible secondary offering before the end of the first quarter. I just wanted -- was hoping for updated commentary on, if you think you would be in a position to commence the buyback program around that same time to be able to participate if that occurs?\nKevin Hogan : Yes. Thanks, Ryan. Our focus is on delivering on our strategies and having the financial flexibility. And we feel really good about where we ended the year. Our capital position at the end of the year was consistent with our strategy. Our RBC in the 410% to 420% [ph] range, similar to the third quarter. And that's, as Elias pointed out in his prepared remarks, after paying $2.2 billion in distributions.  And we also made a provision for some modest cash flow testing reserves in New York. And our parent liquidity is where we expect it to be. It's within our target of being able to pay for our corporate expenses and to have the financial flexibility to invest in attractive new business as well as to complement our committed dividend with additional repurchases. And our leverage is in the range that we intend, in the 25 to 30, at the higher end of the range based on where we are. So we feel good about where we are.  We can't comment further on AIG's plans relative to its strategy, but we have the financial flexibility that we intended.\nRyan Krueger : Great. Thanks. And then follow-up on the expense commentary. I just want to make sure I understood it correctly. Were your comments that you expect $130 million of incremental expense saves to earn in, in 2023 and that $75 million to $100 million of incrementally higher standalone company expenses. I just want to make sure that are those incremental or are they more total amounts? And if any of that was already incorporated into the 2022 results?\nKevin Hogan : Thanks, Ryan. There's a lot of moving parts. I'll ask Elias to sort of unpack all the pieces.\nElias Habayeb: Yes. So Ryan, we've acted or contracted about $232 million in savings related to -- exit run rate savings associated with Corebridge Forward. A little of that has earned in, in 2022. The incremental portion related to the $232 million that we estimate will earn in, in '23 is $130 million. But offsetting it, as you know, we have been -- if you look at over the course of the year, our expense has been coming up as we build up the capabilities to be a standalone public company. That has not fully earned into our results in '22.  So there's an offset of about $75 million to $100 million that we'll earn in next year.\nRyan Krueger : Great, thanks a lot.\nOperator: The next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse, please go ahead.\nElyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. My first question was on the elevated fixed annuity surrender activity in the quarter. I was just hoping to get more color on how customers are behaving given the rising interest rate environment? And what protections do you guys have in place against disintermediation on that product?\nKevin Hogan : Yes. Thanks, Elyse. So the environment for fixed annuities is very attractive, right? The higher rates, the wider spreads means both higher sales, but also very attractive margins. And it does come along with higher surrenders, which are quite natural. And I think that there's three things to keep in mind relative to the surrenders as we look at this portfolio. The first is that while the surrenders are higher, they are lower than our expectations based on where rates and spreads were during the fourth quarter. And so it is a natural part of managing a fixed annuity portfolio to manage surrenders and understand the right time to accept the surrender and essentially replace it with new business at higher margins. And that's essentially what we've chosen to do.  Now in order to be able to do that, you need to have the liquidity associated with that to be able to support the surrender without diluting the margin on the new business. And that has long been a part of our strategy to maintain that liquidity. So that's the first thing to keep in mind. The surrenders, whilst they are higher, are naturally higher based on where the rates were, but lower than what we are prepared for.  The second thing I would say is that kind of indicative of that is that despite the higher surrenders, because of the strength of the new business, we have had strong positive flows of $700 million in the fourth quarter, as Elias pointed out, and $4 billion in the full year. So the general account is growing.  And the third thing I would say is that we do actively manage crediting rates. We have the opportunity to manage crediting rates even for the business beyond the surrender charge period. And that's really where we make the economic decision relative to the value of a surrender as opposed to the opportunity for new business. So we're quite comfortable where the fixed annuity portfolio is. It's possible if rates rise further, spreads widen further, that surrenders may rise, but that means that new business is also likely to rise and the margin is likely even more attractive than what we found in the fourth quarter.\nElyse Greenspan : And then my second question, the parent liquidity went down $500 million in the quarter. I know the interest and dividend's around $250 million. What were the other sources and uses that took that down? And as we think about going forward, is the target -- are you looking for that to still be, I guess, last quarter, I think you said around $1.1 billion after you go through some of the expenses associated with the separation and the program?\nElias Habayeb: Elyse, it's Elias. So we manage our liquidity at the parent to cover the next 12 month worth of expenses or needs from the parent. And we treat the $600 million annual dividend to our shareholders as if it's a fixed cost. So we reserve for it from that perspective. Now -- and that's going to be our philosophy, how we manage liquidity going forward. Where we ended up the year at $1.5 billion, it approximates our next 12 month needs.  And with respect to what drove the decline from the end of September down to the end of December, one element is debt service. Our debt service payments are lumped between the second and the fourth quarter. In addition, we didn't pay the third quarter dividend until October. So you had another $150 million there. And finally, we're making progress on the onetime expenses and that's kind of another contributor to the drop from the third quarter.\nElyse Greenspan : Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Alex, please go ahead. \nAlex Scott: Hi, good morning. First one, I had is a little nuance. I was looking at your interest maintenance reserve and the statutory filings, and it looked like you guys have one of the larger balances. And I was interested just because I think that would potentially give you more flexibility in a higher rate environment to reallocate. And I know you've already sort of talked about these plans to some degree with Blackstone. But just interested in timing and just thinking through the interest maintenance reserve balance, I mean, does that allow you to be a little more aggressive with reallocating more near term?\nElias Habayeb: So hey, Alex, it's Elias. So when we look at our investments plan, we look at totality. IMR is just one element from how we look at balance sheet capacity. But to us, that's not necessarily a determining factor for how we decide what to do with the investment portfolio. As Kevin said, our strategy around investments is really driven by the liabilities and where we see opportunities in the market. And we consider also capital in totality and not just looking at the IMR. We do continue to have a positive IMR balance, but to note, as you've seen in our stat supplement.\nAlex Scott: Understood. Okay, thanks. Second question I had is just a follow-up on some of the commentary on the crediting rate decisions you're making. Could you talk about the benefit of higher net investment income from yields? And how is your decision making around crediting rates evolving? And has that changed at all, the sensitivity that is?\nKevin Hogan : Sure. So let's look at the fourth quarter. So new money rates in the fourth quarter were about 400 basis points higher than what they were at the beginning of the year. And the margins on the new business are extremely attractive, also supported by some of the asset origination through our partner, Blackstone, which are high credit quality as well as higher returning assets in the current market. And so the margin opportunity is really reflected in what's going on with our net spreads.  If you look at the total portfolio on a sequential basis, the net spreads are up 27 basis points and year-over-year, up 54 basis points. That's a reflection of the improving earnings capacity of the business. And in terms of our strategy for managing crediting rates, we understand what the implications of potentially increasing crediting rates could be on preservation of the business. But much of that business would be preserved irrespective of what we do with the crediting rate.  So economically, the new business capital and the margins on the new business capital are more valuable than the capital supporting that in-force business. And it is a dynamic kind of trade, a surrender in fixed annuity and return for new business and indexed annuity. And our team has a great deal of experience in managing the cycle of the fixed annuity and indexed annuity portfolios, and I think we're benefiting from that insight.\nAlex Scott: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from John Barnidge with Piper Sandler. John, please go ahead.\nJohn Barnidge : Thank you very much. Favorable mortality experience was called out. I know UK is a sizable market there and has seen stubbornly elevated mortality. Sequential growth in underwriting margin in that business, was UK mortality improvement, a driver or any additional color on underlying mortality trends, as some noted in early peaking of flu? Thank you.\nKevin Hogan : Yes. Thanks, John. Look we're very happy with the overall life business and the way that it's performed even through the pandemic. And the mortality improvement -- the UK, it's a nice business. It's a fast-growing business in terms of new business, but the balance sheet is still quite small because it's a relatively young business. The real improvement in mortality for us was in the U.S. where once again, even including COVID, which remains at that sensitivity that we have projected since the beginning of the pandemic, even including COVID, was for the second quarter in a row below our pricing expectations.  So the mortality performance really in the U.S. is what is driving that improvement and has consistently been quite attractive over the last couple of years. And we're repositioning the portfolio in the U.S. and that's also going well. We've moved away from the more interest rate-sensitive businesses, essentially stopped VUL and GUL a couple of years ago and are focusing on indexed universal life in the permanent area, and then simpler protection products in the rest of the portfolio.  The fourth quarter did have a couple of one-offs, as Elias mentioned, but the earnings have returned in this portfolio to the levels that we would have expected pre-pandemic. And in addition, it contributes extremely strong cash flows. So we're very happy with the position of the Life business.\nJohn Barnidge : Thank you very much. And my follow-up question, sticking with that business, are you experiencing an increase reinsurance rates after the pandemic? Some other companies have noted that. Thank you.\nKevin Hogan : The reinsurance rate environment following the pandemic hasn't been something that has been a material factor for us in managing the business.\nJohn Barnidge : Thank you very much.\nKevin Hogan : Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Ward with Citi. Michael, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMichael Ward: Thanks. Good morning. I was just wondering if you could discuss some of your portfolio -- investment portfolio changes between asset classes. I think for the year, I noticed you guys rotated out of residential and commercial MBS and into a little bit more CLOs and ABS. So I'm just curious how you see these asset classes, and I assume part of it is from your partnerships with asset managers.\nKevin Hogan : Yes. Thanks, Michael. I'll start and then maybe hand over to Elias. But first of all, I'd just like to say we're very comfortable with our asset portfolio. It's a high-quality, well-diversified portfolio, on average credit rating of single A minus where it's been the last couple of years. And our assets reflect the profile of our liabilities, including our spread businesses, which are, in many cases, illiquid and longer dated. And we do actively manage the portfolio, which has performed well in different cycles. So I think that's the context in which to think about our asset strategy, but I'll hand over to Elias.\nElias Habayeb: Hey, Michael, hi. How are you? So with respect to your question on the portfolio, we have shifted over the course of the year some of the asset allocation. That was a deliberate action. As Kevin said, our investment strategy is driven by the liability side. But we've been working with our asset management partners to see what's the opportunities and see what's the appropriate asset classes for the business we write.  You called out CLO specifically. So our total CLO portfolio as of the end of the year is about $9 billion out of about $200 billion in assets. And the vast majority is investment-grade and over 90% is in single A and better. And we like that asset class. We think it makes a lot of sense given some of the liabilities we issue. And our portfolio over the last 10 years has performed really well.  With respect to 2022, we invested a little over $2 billion in CLO, about $1.6 billion is AA rated class. So we like it, and we're comfortable with it, and it fits our risk appetite.\nMichael Ward: Awesome. Thanks, helpful. And then I was just wondering, as you look forward and recognizing you guys have a lot to work on between expense programs, capital distributions and secondaries, but strategically, just wondering how you think about liability repositioning as in -- and I know we've touched on this in the past, but how do you guys think about your business mix going forward? Are you looking at making any changes from here?\nKevin Hogan : So yes, thanks, Michael. We feel very good about the portfolio that we have. I mean we've worked hard over the last 8, 10 years to focus on the four businesses where we have very strong market positions, strategically well positioned and supported by the tailwinds of the macro environment. But as I think we demonstrated when we created Fortitude Re, we are constantly looking to optimize the liability side of the portfolio. That was a big transaction for us and ultimately derisking with the disposition of that.  We're constantly looking for opportunities to optimize the in-force. And as you would expect, we are in the current conversation relative to where the market is relative to various transactions. We certainly haven't seen anything yet that makes economic sense to us, but we will continue to look for opportunities to optimize. But we're extremely comfortable with the portfolio that we have. We don't see any holes in the portfolio. And we have, as you said, a lot on our plate.  We're focused on executing the strategies necessary to deliver on our financial targets, the 12% to 14% ROE, having the financial flexibility to deliver beyond the dividend and engage in repurchases to get to that 60% to 65% payout ratio once we get through onetime expenses. So that's what we're fully focused on.\nMichael Ward: Awesome, thank you guys.\nKevin Hogan : Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead, Erik.\nErik Bass: Hi, thank you. Just hoping you could give a little bit more color on how you see base NII building over the course of 2023. Maybe how much uplift there still could be from floating rate assets? How much incremental reinvestment is still happening with the assets transferred to Blackstone? And then any sense of just portfolio cash flows to invest at clearly a lot higher new money yields.\nKevin Hogan : Yes. Thanks, Eric. I'll hand over to Elias in a minute here. But the first thing I want to say is that we do not have an intention of any portfolio trade relative to the assets that we transferred to Blackstone. That's not the idea. We transferred them assets to manage, and those assets support our liabilities. So it's not like there's an intention of something like that. I'll ask Elias relative to the further questions on NII, what's happened and where we see it going.\nElias Habayeb: So Eric, hi. So there's been like three drivers behind our base NII and base spread income growth year-over-year through '22. And we expect that trend to continue into 2023. We're benefiting from the higher new money rates. So on the reinvestment side, in the fourth quarter, as Kevin quoted, purchase yields on average are about 7%. That's about 400 basis points up relative to the beginning of the year and 300 basis points above where the portfolio yield was in the fourth quarter. And that's going to continue to earn in.  You also got floaters, and the floaters will be impacted by more short-term rate side, but some of it is matching floating rate liabilities. So that we will give back given what happens to rate. And finally, growth. The portfolio is growing, as you've seen during the quarter of '22. So those three drivers should continue to contribute to growth in base NII as well as base spread income next year.\nErik Bass: Got it. Thank you. And then apologies if I missed this, but Elias, can you spike out what you're including in the $0.16 of favorable items that you mentioned?\nElias Habayeb: Yes. So the $0.16 is on the -- in the earnings deck. It's a combination of -- we had a lower tax rate. We've had a onetime item on investments associated with it. But it's in the earnings that we gave you the details on it.\nErik Bass: Okay, thank you.\nKevin Hogan : Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Suneet Kamath with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSuneet Kamath: Great, thanks. I wanted to ask about the $2.2 billion of distributions to the holding company despite the weaker markets. Is there a way to think about how much of that was RBC drawdown versus capital generated and maybe some thoughts on what you expect for 2023?\nKevin Hogan : Suneet, good to hear from you. So the $2.2 billion is made up of two things. It's made up of dividends that were paid to the holding company, which is about $1.8 billion as well as about $400 million in tax sharing payments paid to AIG. And those are related to tax strategies that increase taxable income but not statutory income. Those strategies ended with the IPO when we deconsolidated from AIG on a tax basis and they reduced kind of dividend capacity dollar for dollar in the past. So that's why we give you this normalized view $2.2 billion.  As it relates to the year, if you look at the past year, the insurance companies distributed about $2.2 billion. We also had the macro environment, and we also grew new business during the course of the year. But in totality, we still ended the year above our target of $400 million. So we're at $410 million to $420 million which still puts us in a healthy position. And if you look historically, our insurance companies distributed about $2 billion a year, that's been our historical trend from there.\nSuneet Kamath: Got it. Okay. And then I guess maybe a separate question just on your annuity philosophy. It seems like you are one of the few companies that's not pursuing the RILA market. And so I'm just curious, why not when it seems like pretty much everybody else is entering that market?\nKevin Hogan : Yes. Thanks, Suneet. When we started developing our index annuity -- our index annuity strategy, we recognize that our suite of both income-oriented and accumulation-oriented index annuities serves a similar population as to the RILA marketplace, albeit with a potential advantage of a zero floor. And we have a broad range of index options for investors to invest in, and our fixed index annuity portfolio continues to expand and grow.  We added an additional option more recently from Dimensional Fund Advisors that seems quite popular. So we haven't necessarily ruled out entering the RILA marketplace, but serving a similar market with a different product has worked well for us so far.\nSuneet Kamath : Okay, thanks Kevin.\nKevin Hogan : Thank you.\nOperator: That's all the questions we have for today. We currently have no further questions in the queue. So I'll hand the call back to Kevin Hogan for closing remarks.\nKevin Hogan : Thanks, everybody for joining the call today to ask your questions. As I mentioned, 2022 is an important year for Corebridge and I would like to thank all of our colleagues across Corebridge, our colleagues at AIG and our various partners for their great work throughout the year. As we look ahead to 2023, we are well-positioned to capitalize on the positive momentum of the last 12 months, which should bolster our ability to deliver on our commitments, and we look forward to creating long-term value for our shareholders. Have a good day. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. This concludes our call, and you may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Elias Habayeb",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. I'll provide additional information about our financial results and key performance metrics as well as a few updates on LDTI and some high level guidance for 2023.  We reported fourth quarter results and full year results this morning, boosted by improving base spread income and favorable mortality experience, notwithstanding recent market conditions. And we continue to make meaningful progress on our strategic initiatives to improve profitability.  Fourth quarter adjusted ROE was 10.6%, operating EPS was $0.88, and adjusted pretax operating income, or APTOI, was $639 million. Our results included several notable items that contributed $0.16 to our operating EPS. These were offset by alternative returns below long term expectations of $0.12 and COVID mortality losses of $0.03. Adjusting for these items, our operating EPS would have been $0.87 for the quarter.  With respect to APTOI, our results were 31% or $287 million below the prior year quarter. Approximately $635 million of this decline was driven by the impact of market conditions and structural changes associated with debt capitalization of Corebridge as well as divestitures completed in 2021. The principal headwind was variable investment income, which accounted for nearly $490 million of the decline.  Excluding variable investment income, APTOI was 48% higher than the fourth quarter of 2021, largely due to increasing base spread income and improving mortality experience. Assets under management and administration was $357 billion as of December 31, up 3% sequentially, reflecting both market conditions and new business growth.  The strength and diversification of our core earnings power is evident when you look at our sources of income for the fourth quarter, which, in aggregate, were up 15% year-over-year, excluding variable investment income. Base spread income, which is our largest source of earnings, grew 25% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 due to higher new money rates coupled with strong growth in our spread-based products.  Fee income, our second largest source of earnings declined 20% versus the prior year quarter partially a function of underlying asset valuations. Underwriting margin, which is primarily derived from our life business, rose 91% year-over-year, excluding variable investment income, mainly due to improving mortality experience.  Shifting to net investment income, base yield was 4.42% in the fourth quarter. This was the second quarter in a row where we saw significant growth with a base yield up 34 basis points sequentially and 54 basis points year-over-year. This growth was driven by a combination of reinvestment activity at higher new money rates, resets on floating rate assets and growth of the overall portfolio as well as a onetime notable item. This notable item contributed 15 basis points to the base yield, most of which benefited our Life Insurance segment.  To reiterate my comments during last quarter's call, we expect the benefit of higher new money rates and our partnership with Blackstone to continue to emerge during future quarters as more of the investment portfolio is reinvested at higher yields and earns in. Thus far, the improvement in base yield has outweighed any increases in policyholder crediting rates.  Moving on to expenses, total operating expenses increased sequentially on a net basis. While our fixed cost benefits from Corebridge Forward activity, they were more than offset by incremental costs that kicked in with our IPO, continued establishment of standalone capabilities as well as a onetime item.  Following up on Kevin's earlier comments about Corebridge Forward, we have a roadmap for $400 million of expense savings, and we have acted upon or contracted approximately $232 million of exit run rate savings as of the end of 2022. Only a small percentage of these savings have earned into our results thus far. We expect that approximately $130 million will earn in, in 2023, with an offset from the full year earn-in effect from incremental costs that we picked up during 2022 to operate a standalone public company, which we estimate at $75 million to $100 million.  We continue to estimate the cost to achieve will approximate $300 million over the life of the initiative, with this onetime investment delivering $400 million in annual run rate savings. So far, the cost to achieve has been $84 million. We continue to expect the implementation of a leaner operating model will contribute approximately one point to ROE growth by 2024.  We also made significant strides separating Corebridge from AIG. To-date, we've incurred about $180 million of the $350 million to $450 million estimated cost to achieve. The bulk of the remaining work is centered around separating shared applications which should largely be completed by the end of 2023 or early '24.  Next, I will speak to segment results, beginning with Individual Retirement, our largest business. Individual Retirement reported APTOI of $436 million, benefiting from strong growth in base spread income as well as overall lower expenses, partially offset by lower fee income. Base spread income for the quarter was up 35% over the prior year quarter, driven by spread expansion. Base net investment spreads increased 54 basis points year-over-year and 27 basis points sequentially.  Fee income declined 21% due to lower asset valuations and net outflows in our variable annuity portfolio. Our hedging programs continued to perform as expected despite volatile market conditions. The higher rates that have been driving our strong sales at attractive margins are as expected, also leading to higher surrenders. That being said, our surrender rate remains below our expectation and net inflows in the general account were quite strong at $740 million in the fourth quarter and over $4 billion for all of 2022.  In addition, we maintained strong liquidity in the general account, well positioning us to cover surrenders which we expect will remain elevated in 2023 relative to historical levels due to the materially higher interest rate and credit spread environment.  Group Retirement has been influenced by many of the same trends impacting Individual Retirement. Group Retirement reported APTOI of $177 million, benefiting from strong growth in base spread income, offset by lower fee income. Base spread income grew 13% versus the fourth quarter of 2021 due to spread expansion. Base net investment spread increased 17 basis points year-over-year but was flat sequentially.  Fee income declined 20% year-over-year due to lower asset valuations and net outflows. While net flows remain negative, we continue to see outflows concentrated in the higher GMIR bucket with inflows in the lower GMIR buckets. This trend is expected to improve the spread profile for the business over time.  We expect continued growth of our advisory and brokerage fee revenue, which reflects our strategy to pivot the business into a platform which provides for a higher stream of less captive incentive cash flows over time.  Life Insurance reported APTOI of $97 million in the fourth quarter inclusive of $22 million of notable items. Core underwriting margin, excluding notable items, improved 78% year-over-year due to improved mortality experience. Our fourth quarter mortality experience was favorable to expectation, inclusive of $21 million of COVID losses.  Notable items in Life Insurance included approximately $64 million of a onetime item in net investment income, offset by $42 million related to the positive resolution of certain legal matters. The legal matters included a recapture of certain YRT treaties that were subject to arbitration as well as the resolution of an unrelated litigation matter. We have now resolved a majority of our YRT disputes.  Considering this business more broadly and looking forward, we expect continued growth of base portfolio income and a reversion to historical mortality levels as COVID moves into an endemic phase. Institutional markets reported APTOI of $64 million in the fourth quarter with stable core sources of income as compared to the prior year quarter. The year-over-year decline in APTOI was largely driven by lower variable investment income.  Total insurance reserves grew 8% year-over-year, reflecting the growth of our PRT business and gate [ph] portfolio. We're encouraged by the progression of the institutional markets business, reflecting consistent revenue growth -- sorry, reserve growth, strong new business margins and expanding spreads, which we expect will continue to improve profitability in 2023.  And lastly, losses in our Corporate and Other segment increased sequentially due to higher interest expense, resulting from a full quarter of debt service on hybrid securities and the delayed draw term loan, which was drawn down in the third quarter 2022.  Turning to our balance sheet, we assess the strength of our balance sheet through different lenses including, but not limited to liquidity levels, capital ratios, financial leverage and our risk profile. Our balance sheet remains healthy with strong liquidity and capital as well as a balanced diversified investment portfolio and reasonable financial leverage as of December 31.  Adjusted book value was $21.4 billion or $33.10 per share, up 9% year-over-year, but down 2% from the third quarter. The sequential decline was due to derivative and foreign exchange mark-to-market losses in the fourth quarter that partially reversed gains from the first nine months of the year.  Our financial leverage ratio was 29.6%, within our target range. We continue to expect that our balance sheet will naturally delever over time as a result of book value growth. Our Life Fleet RBC ratio remained strong and was above target of 400%, largely aligned with the prior year quarter estimate -- prior quarter estimate. Recognizing there's a lot of uncertainty in the macro environment, we feel we're starting 2023 in a strong position.  We ended the year with ample holding company liquidity of $1.5 billion. Our insurance companies returned $2.2 billion of normalized distribution during 2022 on par with the distributions made in each of the preceding three years. We paid dividends to our shareholders of approximately $300 million since the IPO. We declared our dividend for the first quarter of 2023, which will be paid on March 31. This represents a dividend yield over 4% based upon our recent stock price.  As Kevin previously indicated, we remain focused on delivering on our financial goals, including achieving a total payout ratio of 60% to 65% by 2024.  Pivoting to LDTI, it's important to remember that LTI [ph] does not impact our economic returns, statutory results or insurance company cash flows. When we begin reporting under LDTI in 2023, we expect to see reduced volatility in our operating results given changes to the accounting for market risk benefits impact. The impact to our operating earnings run rate should be neutral to modestly favorable over time.  We expect continued volatility in our GAAP earnings due to the requirement to fair value market risk benefits in our GAAP results. We also expect an increase in adjusted book value which we currently estimate to approximate $1.5 billion as of September 30, 2022.  In terms of the initial transition adjustment as of January 1, 2021, we currently estimate an approximate $1 billion to $1.5 billion reduction in GAAP shareholders' equity resulting from a decline in other comprehensive income, offset by an increase in retained earnings. We further estimate the overall impact to GAAP shareholders' equity as of September 30, 2022, is an increase of approximately $1 billion. This favorable impact to book value reflects the benefit of Corporate having a diversified balance sheet, including both life and annuity products.  In terms of sensitivities to macro factors, our preliminary estimate of the APTOI impact from movements in equities and interest rates post LDTI are as follows. First, an immediate 10% reduction in equities is expected to reduce fee income net of advisory fee expense by approximately $85 million over a 12 month period. And second, an immediate upward parallel shift of 100 basis points across the treasury curve is expected to raise APTOI by approximately $165 million, $265 million and $365 million for each of the first, second and third years following the rate increase.  Now I would like to conclude with a commentary on our outlook for 2023. Looking ahead, we expect to achieve EPS growth resulting from our initiatives involving expense savings, investments, organic growth and capital management. As to our sources of income over the next 12 months, we expect to see incremental growth in base spread income and underwriting margins, while fee income will depend on the extent of a recovery in asset valuations.  We continue to expect long-term return assumptions for our alternative investments will range between 8% and 9%. And finally, we expect our effective tax rate will approximate 21% in 2023 before discrete items.  In summary, we remain focused on executing our strategies and deploying capital in a way that aids our efforts to create sustainable and profitable long-term growth. We have a strong balance sheet, and we remain focused on delivering on our financial goals.  I will now hand it back to Kevin. Yes. So Ryan, we've acted or contracted about $232 million in savings related to -- exit run rate savings associated with Corebridge Forward. A little of that has earned in, in 2022. The incremental portion related to the $232 million that we estimate will earn in, in '23 is $130 million. But offsetting it, as you know, we have been -- if you look at over the course of the year, our expense has been coming up as we build up the capabilities to be a standalone public company. That has not fully earned into our results in '22.  So there's an offset of about $75 million to $100 million that we'll earn in next year. Elyse, it's Elias. So we manage our liquidity at the parent to cover the next 12 month worth of expenses or needs from the parent. And we treat the $600 million annual dividend to our shareholders as if it's a fixed cost. So we reserve for it from that perspective. Now -- and that's going to be our philosophy, how we manage liquidity going forward. Where we ended up the year at $1.5 billion, it approximates our next 12 month needs.  And with respect to what drove the decline from the end of September down to the end of December, one element is debt service. Our debt service payments are lumped between the second and the fourth quarter. In addition, we didn't pay the third quarter dividend until October. So you had another $150 million there. And finally, we're making progress on the onetime expenses and that's kind of another contributor to the drop from the third quarter. So hey, Alex, it's Elias. So when we look at our investments plan, we look at totality. IMR is just one element from how we look at balance sheet capacity. But to us, that's not necessarily a determining factor for how we decide what to do with the investment portfolio. As Kevin said, our strategy around investments is really driven by the liabilities and where we see opportunities in the market. And we consider also capital in totality and not just looking at the IMR. We do continue to have a positive IMR balance, but to note, as you've seen in our stat supplement. Hey, Michael, hi. How are you? So with respect to your question on the portfolio, we have shifted over the course of the year some of the asset allocation. That was a deliberate action. As Kevin said, our investment strategy is driven by the liability side. But we've been working with our asset management partners to see what's the opportunities and see what's the appropriate asset classes for the business we write.  You called out CLO specifically. So our total CLO portfolio as of the end of the year is about $9 billion out of about $200 billion in assets. And the vast majority is investment-grade and over 90% is in single A and better. And we like that asset class. We think it makes a lot of sense given some of the liabilities we issue. And our portfolio over the last 10 years has performed really well.  With respect to 2022, we invested a little over $2 billion in CLO, about $1.6 billion is AA rated class. So we like it, and we're comfortable with it, and it fits our risk appetite. So Eric, hi. So there's been like three drivers behind our base NII and base spread income growth year-over-year through '22. And we expect that trend to continue into 2023. We're benefiting from the higher new money rates. So on the reinvestment side, in the fourth quarter, as Kevin quoted, purchase yields on average are about 7%. That's about 400 basis points up relative to the beginning of the year and 300 basis points above where the portfolio yield was in the fourth quarter. And that's going to continue to earn in.  You also got floaters, and the floaters will be impacted by more short-term rate side, but some of it is matching floating rate liabilities. So that we will give back given what happens to rate. And finally, growth. The portfolio is growing, as you've seen during the quarter of '22. So those three drivers should continue to contribute to growth in base NII as well as base spread income next year. Yes. So the $0.16 is on the -- in the earnings deck. It's a combination of -- we had a lower tax rate. We've had a onetime item on investments associated with it. But it's in the earnings that we gave you the details on it."

            "name": "Kevin Hogan",
            "content": "Thank you, Josh, and good morning to everyone. During our call today, we will present our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results. I will speak to the competitive landscape, review the progress we are making on our core strategies, reinforce our commitment to our financial goals and discuss how Corebridge is well positioned to create long-term value for shareholders and other stakeholders. Elias will then deliver additional details on our financial results, offer a few comments on LDTI and provide some guidance for 2023.  Corebridge Financial had a strong debut in 2022, notwithstanding external conditions. We delivered operating earnings per share of $0.88 in the fourth quarter and $2.87 for the year. Our results for the fourth quarter and the full year demonstrate the resilience of our franchise and the competitive strengths of our businesses. Our diverse sources of earnings, our broad product platform and our unrivaled network of distribution partners remain strategic advantages for Corebridge, and position us to perform well in different market environments.  Our businesses grew in 2022 as we expanded our product range, enhanced customer solutions, advanced strategic initiatives and began to implement a leaner operating model, all while completing our initial public offering last September. We are well on the way toward creating sustainable, profitable and incremental growth while delivering on the strategies and financial goals we've previously outlined.  Adjusting for earnings volatility related to market conditions, such as from variable investment income, the earnings power of our core insurance businesses improved, aided by tailwinds from higher interest rates, wider credit spreads and favorable mortality, which more than offset headwinds from equity market performance. New money rates more than doubled this year, climbing to 7% in the fourth quarter, an increase of approximately 400 basis points. Over the last 12 months, base net investment spread expanded during the second half of the year, contributing to a healthy level of organic growth.  Looking at individual retirement, we delivered balanced sales with healthy margins and strong general account cash flows across our spread-based products. The breadth of our portfolio and the strength of our distribution partnerships helped us generate premiums and deposits of $3.8 billion in the fourth quarter contributing to $15.1 billion of new deposits over the course of 2022, with positive net flows of $2.4 billion, reflecting nearly 200% growth in net flows year-over-year.  In fixed annuity, we saw some of the best conditions in recent memory. At the same time, we remain disciplined, effectively balancing competitiveness and margin growth. We delivered sales of more than $1.3 billion in each quarter of 2022, contributing to $5.7 billion in premiums and deposits for full year 2022, an 89% increase year-over-year. This extraordinary level of new business reflects a strong appetite for fixed annuity products in the marketplace, combined with the strength of our bank distribution relationships.  Fixed index annuity also benefited from a very attractive landscape with $1.7 billion of premiums and deposits in the fourth quarter and over $6.3 billion for the full year. Full year net inflows were $4.5 billion. The strong position of this business is supported by our income and accumulation products, which we distribute across a broad range of channels.  In Group Retirement, premiums and deposits were also strong at nearly $2.2 billion for the fourth quarter or approximately $8 billion for the full year, supported by new planned acquisitions and growth of out-of-plan deposits, in particular, in fixed annuities. These out-of-plan deposits reflect one part of our broader strategy for this business, which includes serving individuals outside of their traditional employer-sponsored retirement plans. And as a reminder, large new plant acquisitions or surrenders are nonlinear.  Thinking about retirement across group and individual, we were pleased the U.S. Congress was able to pass SECURE 2.0. This federal legislation is another important step in building a stronger retirement system and improving retirement outcomes for all Americans. We anticipate a positive impact from SECURE 2.0 across both our individual and group retirement businesses as this legislation should result in increased contributions, larger account balances and delayed withdrawals from retirement accounts.  Life Insurance generated stable premiums and deposits year-over-year as we continue to transform this business. Sales over the last year reflect our efforts to improve the mix of business in the U.S. and to grow the business in the UK. And in institutional markets, we closed pension risk transfer transactions totaling $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter. While premiums and deposits were lower in the fourth quarter and full year versus 2021, we continue to see a robust pipeline for full plan terminations in the U.S. and the UK.  We also remain confident in our ability to become a more consistent issuer of GICs in the future, subject to market conditions. Overall, I am very pleased with the performance of our businesses and the levels of organic growth we produced in spite of challenging market and industry conditions. We have a lot of momentum particularly since completing our IPO and we are well positioned to grow and continue to strengthen our relationships with distribution partners in the coming year.  Next, I will discuss the progress we are making to advance our investment partnerships and our efficiency strategies that I outlined during our third quarter earnings call. Our partnerships with Blackstone and BlackRock continued to benefit us as they each bring considerable resources to bear in support of our strategic initiatives.  Looking at Blackstone first, we continue to see great value from our growing relationship. Blackstone's asset sourcing capabilities have aided our product competitiveness as they are able to originate attractive assets at volumes we could not previously achieved. These assets are successfully supporting all four of our businesses. For the full year, Blackstone executed approximately $8 billion of new transactions across a variety of asset classes, including private and structured credit at an average gross yield of just over 6.5% and an average credit quality of single A.  The purchase yield on assets originated during the fourth quarter was 7.2%. We've been putting more money to work in private credit as we believe this asset class will generally perform better during a downturn due to the structural protections that are built into these transactions.  With respect to BlackRock, they are now managing approximately $83 billion of our invested assets, primarily focused on the public liquid credit portfolio. We also continue to make strides in our migration to BlackRock's Aladdin platform, which will further modernize our infrastructure and provide us with expanded analytics and accounting capabilities. We expect to be live on this platform in 2024.  Partnering with these world class asset managers greatly enhances our access to attractive assets but does not reflect the change to our investment strategy, risk appetite or asset allocation process. We own the balance sheet, and we will continue to direct asset allocation regardless of the source of origination. Our investment strategy has always been and will remain liability driven. Our diversified and high-quality investment portfolio is well matched to our liability profile.  Our risk appetite remains unchanged relative to our liabilities. We continue to actively manage both the performance and the risk of the entire portfolio, irrespective of origination and we are proactive in taking action on individual assets when appropriate. We believe we will be able to respond effectively to any changes in the credit cycle.  Now turning to Corebridge Forward, our modernization program that will deliver both expense reduction and increased efficiency. We have contracted on $232 million of exit run rate savings. This equates to more than 50% of our stated goal of $400 million of run rate savings over the next three years. Much of the exit run rate savings to date represent refinements to our operating model, enhanced outsourcing with existing partners, real estate consolidation opportunities and the early stages of our IT modernization, which will eventually lead to our ability to exit our data centers.  We continue to expect the majority of the run rate savings to earn in within 24 months of our IPO. Elias will provide more information in his remarks.  Turning to our financial goals, we remain focused on achieving each of the targets we outlined on our last earnings call as we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, deliver disciplined growth and provide an attractive return to shareholders. We maintain a clear line of sight toward achieving an ROE of 12% to 14%, and we remain committed to delivering capital to our shareholders through a combination of $600 million in annual dividends along with share repurchases, resulting in a 60% to 65% payout ratio on adjusted after-tax operating income. We are on target to achieve these goals within 24 months of our IPO.  Before turning the call over to Elias, I would like to add a few comments about our commitment to creating shareholder and broader stakeholder value. As I look back on 2022, market conditions were challenging. Our team demonstrated an ability to respond, leveraging our unique platform to maximize opportunities as they arose. While 2023 remains uncertain and volatile, we are well positioned to deliver to customers, shareholders and our other stakeholders.  Our broad diversification across products and channels continues to serve us well as we are not dependent upon a single product or distribution channel. We remain nimble and we'll pursue profitable growth by focusing on areas where risk-adjusted returns are the most attractive in our new business growth as this is most accretive to our operating earnings. While we have recently been emphasizing capital deployment to our spread-based businesses, our fee-based business remains healthy and is poised to benefit when asset values recover and investor appetite rebounds.  To summarize, the core strengths of Corebridge, coupled with changes to our operating model and the execution of our strategic initiatives position us to continue to generate attractive financial results under various scenarios. This, in combination with our active capital management strategy puts us in a position to create long-term shareholder value.  I will now turn the call over to Elias. Thank you, Elias. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Yes. Thanks, Ryan. Our focus is on delivering on our strategies and having the financial flexibility. And we feel really good about where we ended the year. Our capital position at the end of the year was consistent with our strategy. Our RBC in the 410% to 420% [ph] range, similar to the third quarter. And that's, as Elias pointed out in his prepared remarks, after paying $2.2 billion in distributions.  And we also made a provision for some modest cash flow testing reserves in New York. And our parent liquidity is where we expect it to be. It's within our target of being able to pay for our corporate expenses and to have the financial flexibility to invest in attractive new business as well as to complement our committed dividend with additional repurchases. And our leverage is in the range that we intend, in the 25 to 30, at the higher end of the range based on where we are. So we feel good about where we are.  We can't comment further on AIG's plans relative to its strategy, but we have the financial flexibility that we intended. Thanks, Ryan. There's a lot of moving parts. I'll ask Elias to sort of unpack all the pieces. Yes. Thanks, Elyse. So the environment for fixed annuities is very attractive, right? The higher rates, the wider spreads means both higher sales, but also very attractive margins. And it does come along with higher surrenders, which are quite natural. And I think that there's three things to keep in mind relative to the surrenders as we look at this portfolio. The first is that while the surrenders are higher, they are lower than our expectations based on where rates and spreads were during the fourth quarter. And so it is a natural part of managing a fixed annuity portfolio to manage surrenders and understand the right time to accept the surrender and essentially replace it with new business at higher margins. And that's essentially what we've chosen to do.  Now in order to be able to do that, you need to have the liquidity associated with that to be able to support the surrender without diluting the margin on the new business. And that has long been a part of our strategy to maintain that liquidity. So that's the first thing to keep in mind. The surrenders, whilst they are higher, are naturally higher based on where the rates were, but lower than what we are prepared for.  The second thing I would say is that kind of indicative of that is that despite the higher surrenders, because of the strength of the new business, we have had strong positive flows of $700 million in the fourth quarter, as Elias pointed out, and $4 billion in the full year. So the general account is growing.  And the third thing I would say is that we do actively manage crediting rates. We have the opportunity to manage crediting rates even for the business beyond the surrender charge period. And that's really where we make the economic decision relative to the value of a surrender as opposed to the opportunity for new business. So we're quite comfortable where the fixed annuity portfolio is. It's possible if rates rise further, spreads widen further, that surrenders may rise, but that means that new business is also likely to rise and the margin is likely even more attractive than what we found in the fourth quarter. Sure. So let's look at the fourth quarter. So new money rates in the fourth quarter were about 400 basis points higher than what they were at the beginning of the year. And the margins on the new business are extremely attractive, also supported by some of the asset origination through our partner, Blackstone, which are high credit quality as well as higher returning assets in the current market. And so the margin opportunity is really reflected in what's going on with our net spreads.  If you look at the total portfolio on a sequential basis, the net spreads are up 27 basis points and year-over-year, up 54 basis points. That's a reflection of the improving earnings capacity of the business. And in terms of our strategy for managing crediting rates, we understand what the implications of potentially increasing crediting rates could be on preservation of the business. But much of that business would be preserved irrespective of what we do with the crediting rate.  So economically, the new business capital and the margins on the new business capital are more valuable than the capital supporting that in-force business. And it is a dynamic kind of trade, a surrender in fixed annuity and return for new business and indexed annuity. And our team has a great deal of experience in managing the cycle of the fixed annuity and indexed annuity portfolios, and I think we're benefiting from that insight. Yes. Thanks, John. Look we're very happy with the overall life business and the way that it's performed even through the pandemic. And the mortality improvement -- the UK, it's a nice business. It's a fast-growing business in terms of new business, but the balance sheet is still quite small because it's a relatively young business. The real improvement in mortality for us was in the U.S. where once again, even including COVID, which remains at that sensitivity that we have projected since the beginning of the pandemic, even including COVID, was for the second quarter in a row below our pricing expectations.  So the mortality performance really in the U.S. is what is driving that improvement and has consistently been quite attractive over the last couple of years. And we're repositioning the portfolio in the U.S. and that's also going well. We've moved away from the more interest rate-sensitive businesses, essentially stopped VUL and GUL a couple of years ago and are focusing on indexed universal life in the permanent area, and then simpler protection products in the rest of the portfolio.  The fourth quarter did have a couple of one-offs, as Elias mentioned, but the earnings have returned in this portfolio to the levels that we would have expected pre-pandemic. And in addition, it contributes extremely strong cash flows. So we're very happy with the position of the Life business. The reinsurance rate environment following the pandemic hasn't been something that has been a material factor for us in managing the business. Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Michael. I'll start and then maybe hand over to Elias. But first of all, I'd just like to say we're very comfortable with our asset portfolio. It's a high-quality, well-diversified portfolio, on average credit rating of single A minus where it's been the last couple of years. And our assets reflect the profile of our liabilities, including our spread businesses, which are, in many cases, illiquid and longer dated. And we do actively manage the portfolio, which has performed well in different cycles. So I think that's the context in which to think about our asset strategy, but I'll hand over to Elias. So yes, thanks, Michael. We feel very good about the portfolio that we have. I mean we've worked hard over the last 8, 10 years to focus on the four businesses where we have very strong market positions, strategically well positioned and supported by the tailwinds of the macro environment. But as I think we demonstrated when we created Fortitude Re, we are constantly looking to optimize the liability side of the portfolio. That was a big transaction for us and ultimately derisking with the disposition of that.  We're constantly looking for opportunities to optimize the in-force. And as you would expect, we are in the current conversation relative to where the market is relative to various transactions. We certainly haven't seen anything yet that makes economic sense to us, but we will continue to look for opportunities to optimize. But we're extremely comfortable with the portfolio that we have. We don't see any holes in the portfolio. And we have, as you said, a lot on our plate.  We're focused on executing the strategies necessary to deliver on our financial targets, the 12% to 14% ROE, having the financial flexibility to deliver beyond the dividend and engage in repurchases to get to that 60% to 65% payout ratio once we get through onetime expenses. So that's what we're fully focused on. Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Eric. I'll hand over to Elias in a minute here. But the first thing I want to say is that we do not have an intention of any portfolio trade relative to the assets that we transferred to Blackstone. That's not the idea. We transferred them assets to manage, and those assets support our liabilities. So it's not like there's an intention of something like that. I'll ask Elias relative to the further questions on NII, what's happened and where we see it going. Thank you. Suneet, good to hear from you. So the $2.2 billion is made up of two things. It's made up of dividends that were paid to the holding company, which is about $1.8 billion as well as about $400 million in tax sharing payments paid to AIG. And those are related to tax strategies that increase taxable income but not statutory income. Those strategies ended with the IPO when we deconsolidated from AIG on a tax basis and they reduced kind of dividend capacity dollar for dollar in the past. So that's why we give you this normalized view $2.2 billion.  As it relates to the year, if you look at the past year, the insurance companies distributed about $2.2 billion. We also had the macro environment, and we also grew new business during the course of the year. But in totality, we still ended the year above our target of $400 million. So we're at $410 million to $420 million which still puts us in a healthy position. And if you look historically, our insurance companies distributed about $2 billion a year, that's been our historical trend from there. Yes. Thanks, Suneet. When we started developing our index annuity -- our index annuity strategy, we recognize that our suite of both income-oriented and accumulation-oriented index annuities serves a similar population as to the RILA marketplace, albeit with a potential advantage of a zero floor. And we have a broad range of index options for investors to invest in, and our fixed index annuity portfolio continues to expand and grow.  We added an additional option more recently from Dimensional Fund Advisors that seems quite popular. So we haven't necessarily ruled out entering the RILA marketplace, but serving a similar market with a different product has worked well for us so far. Thank you. Thanks, everybody for joining the call today to ask your questions. As I mentioned, 2022 is an important year for Corebridge and I would like to thank all of our colleagues across Corebridge, our colleagues at AIG and our various partners for their great work throughout the year. As we look ahead to 2023, we are well-positioned to capitalize on the positive momentum of the last 12 months, which should bolster our ability to deliver on our commitments, and we look forward to creating long-term value for our shareholders. Have a good day. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Corebridge Financial Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. My name is Lauren, and I will be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions]  \n I will now hand you over to your host, Josh Smith, Head of Investor Relations, to begin. Josh, please go ahead. \nJosh Smith: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Corebridge Financial's third quarter earnings update. \n Today's remarks may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based upon management's current expectations. \n Corebridge's filings with the SEC provide details on important factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by the applicable securities laws, Corebridge is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change.  \n Additionally, today's remarks may refer to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at www.corebridgefinancial.com.  \n With that, I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Kevin Hogan. \nKevin Hogan: Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our first earnings call as Corebridge Financial. I am joined today by Elias Habayeb, our Chief Financial Officer.  \n Over the last 2 years, a great number of people from our own team, our parent company AIG and our various partners worked diligently to position Corebridge Financial to become a successful standalone public company. This culminated with our September 15 listing on the New York Stock Exchange. I would like to start by thanking all of those that were involved for their contributions in reaching this milestone.  \n During today's call, I will focus on our financial performance and current market conditions, reinforce our commitment to our stated financial targets, provide an update on recent strategic progress and review our strong financial position. Elias will provide additional detail on our financial results, and then we will take questions.  \n The third quarter was a very good quarter for Corebridge Financial. I am both pleased with our results and confident in our future. We delivered solid sales in the dynamic market. We made significant progress on our core strategies. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we are on pace to deliver an attractive return of capital to shareholders.  \n Corebridge reported operating earnings per share of $0.57 for the third quarter, with an adjusted return on average equity, or adjusted ROAE, of 6.8%. This reflects strong results from our core businesses in the face of a challenging macroeconomic environment that was felt across our industry. \n Recent market dynamics, such as the pullback in equity markets, increased interest rates and widened credit spreads, and resulting asset value reductions affected each of our businesses to different degrees in the quarter. However, I want to emphasize that we expect that short-term market-related impacts should be more than offset over time by the long-term upside we experienced from rising interest rates and the impact that has on driving sales and margin growth. \n The benefits from these conditions began to emerge last quarter, supporting strong new business generation and leading to an inflection point, where historical year-over-year 8 to 16 basis points of base net investment spread compression finally turned from a headwind to a tailwind. We are now seeing spread expansion for the first time in years. Elias will provide more details on this important emerging development.  \n Turning to the financial targets we disclosed as part of the IPO. We remain confident in achieving each of them as we maintain a strong balance sheet and deliver disciplined growth. We have a clear line of sight on achieving an adjusted ROAE of 12% to 14% and delivering a 60% to 65% payout ratio on adjusted after-tax operating income within 24 months from the IPO. \n We expect to deliver capital to our shareholders through a combination of $600 million in annual dividends, along with share repurchases. We have committed to an annual dividend payable quarterly and have already paid our first and declared our second quarterly dividend. And we expect to have the financial flexibility to complement our dividend with additional return of capital to shareholders as early as the second quarter of 2023.  \n Our ability to execute our capital management strategy is based on the strength of our balance sheet, the consistency of our insurance company cash flows and the diversification in our businesses and earnings sources.  \n During the third quarter, we also made significant progress on organic growth, investment partnerships and efficiency strategies. As to organic growth, we delivered a strong quarter with robust sales and deposit flows. All 4 of our businesses delivered year-over-year growth in the quarter, and all 4 were supported by assets originated by Blackstone. \n Our multiple sources of earnings, diversified product platform and network of distribution partners represent a strategic advantage. We are able to pursue profitable organic growth opportunities by focusing where risk-adjusted returns are the most attractive and customer needs the greatest under various market conditions. \n The third quarter once again demonstrated our ability to remain nimble and to pivot between spread-based and fee-based products as capital markets evolve, driving more attractive opportunities for policyholders and for our business in our spread-based products, such as both our fixed and fixed index annuities.\n Fixed index annuity conditions were very appealing across our broad range of channels, supported by our income and accumulation products. We set a company record for sales this quarter with deposits of over $1.7 billion, and we delivered positive net flows of $1.3 billion. \n The strong position and consistent performance of our fixed index annuity business, a core product for us and individual retirement, has yielded over $4 billion of positive net flows over the last 12 months. \n Fixed annuity conditions also remain attractive, where we continue to mobilize our strong position in bank distribution and were further supported by Blackstone's ability to originate attractive assets, leading to fixed annuity sales of approximately $1.3 billion for the third consecutive quarter. \n Overall, individual retirement delivered deposits of $3.8 billion for the quarter, reflecting 17% growth year-over-year and positive net flows of nearly $700 million over the 3-month period.  \n In Group Retirement, deposits were also strong at $2 billion, 11% higher than the prior year quarter, supported in part by new plan acquisitions and growth of out-of-plan deposits, in particular, in fixed annuities.  \n Turning to Life Insurance. While premiums and deposits were consistent year-over-year, they reflect an improving mix of business in the U.S. and a continuing growth trend in the U.K., where we remain optimistic about our international growth prospects. \n And lastly, in Institutional Markets, we had strong GIC issuance of $1 billion, originated $760 million of pension risk transfer transactions and saw inflows to stable value wraps in the face of market uncertainty. We remain focused on full plan terminations in the U.S. and U.K. With attractive funding levels for many plans, our pension risk transfer pipeline remains robust. We also remain confident in our ability to become a more consistent issuer of GICs in the future.  \n Our broad position across products and channels has been especially advantageous, as we have been able to respond effectively to rapidly changing market conditions and investor appetites. \n We are also making good progress in implementing our investment partnerships with both Blackstone and BlackRock. First, Blackstone continues to originate attractive assets across the duration spectrum and volumes that we could not previously achieve, supporting our product competitiveness and recent growth. \n The partnership is running well, with Blackstone managing $50 billion of assets that we transferred at the end of 2021 and reinvesting proceeds from those assets. To date, Blackstone has originated approximately $5 billion of private and structured credit at an average gross yield of 6% and an average credit quality of BBB+. \n This new origination is part of the asset mix that has supported growth in our shorter-dated annuities and is positioned to support our strong pipeline of pension risk transfer opportunities.  \n With respect to BlackRock, we are well ahead of the original schedule to transfer our public liquid assets and some private securities, representing $90 billion in amortized cost and $76 billion in market value. As of today, we have substantially completed these asset transfers. \n We are also in the product -- project planning stages of the Aladdin platform, which will further modernize our infrastructure and provide us with expanded analytics and accounting capabilities.  \n In addition to modernizing our business, we are also driving towards a leaner operating model. Our expense reduction and productivity program, known as Corebridge Forward, includes various initiatives such as leveraging our current outsourcing partnerships, refining our target operating model, modernizing our IT infrastructure and rationalizing our real estate footprint. \n It is expected to generate approximately $400 million of savings on a run rate basis, with the majority achieved within the next 2 years. We have already made meaningful progress and have achieved just over $100 million of run rate savings year-to-date, ahead of the original plan to achieve the initial $100 million of savings by the end of the year. Elias will provide more information on our Corebridge Forward program.  \n Turning to the balance sheet. Our capital, liquidity and leverage positions remain strong, despite recent market conditions. Year-to-date, our insurance companies have distributed $2 billion of dividends and tax-sharing payments tied to tax strategies. Our strong position gives us confidence that we are on the path to deliver on our stated financial commitments.  \n We are excited about our current opportunities and what the future holds for Corebridge. We are gaining momentum from some of the most attractive pricing conditions in recent memory as well as strong tailwinds generated by the rising interest rate environment. We are well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities moving forward while, at the same time, delivering on our capital commitments to shareholders.  \n I will now turn the call over to Elias. \nElias Habayeb: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. I will provide more details about our financial results and key performance metrics as well as a few updates on the fourth quarter.  \n Corebridge's performance during the third quarter demonstrates the power of our franchise and the competitive strength of our businesses. We delivered strong growth in our diversified product offerings, with premiums and deposits increasing 23% year-over-year. \n In addition, and for the first time in many years, the base yield in our insurance companies as well as the base net investment spread in both of our retirement businesses expanded on a sequential basis as well as on a year-over-year basis. We believe this represents a new trend towards further growth in our base spread income.  \n Our balance sheet continues to maintain a healthy buffer to our target RBC ratio and the cash flows distributed by our insurance companies in the first 9 months of this year approximate the total distributions made in the entire prior year. \n This morning, we reported third quarter adjusted ROAE of 6.8% and operating EPS of $0.57, which includes notable items that lowered our operating EPS by $0.07. In addition, alternative investment returns were below long-term expectations by approximately $0.16, and COVID mortality losses in the quarter amounted to $0.03. Details are provided on Page 5 of the earnings presentation available on our website.  \n Adjusted pretax operating income, or APTOI, was $423 million, approximately $449 million below a year ago. The decrease in APTOI was driven by approximately a $785 million reduction due to the impact of market conditions on variable investment income, DAC amortization, SOP 03-1 reserves and fee income, as well as structural changes associated with the debt capitalization of Corebridge and divestitures completed in 2021. \n This was offset in part by increasing base spread income, improving overall mortality experience, lower expenses and a comparatively better impact from the annual actuarial assumption review.  \n Turning to earnings. The strength and diversification of our core earnings power is readily apparent when you break down our sources of earnings, which are up 4% year-over-year after excluding variable investment income. Base spread income, which is our largest source of earnings, grew 7% year-over-year. \n The longer lasting benefits of higher new money rates and our partnership with Blackstone continue to emerge with more to earn-in during future quarters as more of the investment portfolio is reinvested at higher yields. Since the beginning of this year, we've seen new money rates increase by approximately 300 basis points, presenting a strong tailwind for our base spread income.  \n Fee income, our second largest source of earnings, is partially a function of underlying asset valuations. Fee income declined 18% versus the prior year quarter due to recent declines in fixed income and equity asset valuations.  And fee income is expected to recover as asset valuations increase. \n Underwriting margin, excluding variable investment income, which is primarily derived from our Life business, rose 62% year-over-year due to improving mortality experience.  \n With respect to net investment income, I would like to focus on our base yield, which was 4.08% for the quarter. The base yield was up 5 basis points year-over-year and was up 24 basis points sequentially. The base yield improvement was driven by a combination of factors that includes reinvestment activities at higher rates, reset on floating rate positions and growth of the overall portfolio. \n New money rates in the quarter were approximately 6%, having increased 300 basis points since the beginning of the year and now exceed base yields by approximately 200 basis points. Accordingly, we have achieved year-over-year spread expansion for the first time in many years. \n Looking forward, while we expect our base yield to continue to benefit from the higher new money rates and floating rate resets, the quantum of the sequential increase will depend on a number of variables, including rates and spreads.  \n Next, I want to provide you an update on Corebridge Forward, our expense reduction and productivity program. As Kevin indicated, as of September 30, we've already achieved over $100 million of the nearly $400 million of run rate savings from Corebridge Forward that we disclosed as part of our IPO. \n The majority of the savings achieved to date represent headcount reductions against our expense baseline, which includes the incremental costs of approximately $300 million to be a separate company. We continue to estimate the onetime cost to achieve of the total $400 million run rate savings program to be in the $300 million range. To date, we've incurred $66 million in costs, which is reported as a component of restructuring and other costs below the line. \n I would note that, while we've been able to eliminate some of the expected increase in corporate expenses, we still expect our corporate expenses to increase to approximately $60 million in the fourth quarter as certain expenses kicked in with the IPO.\n In terms of our separation efforts from AIG, we continue to estimate that the total investment to complete separation will be in the $350 million to $450 million range, in addition to the $300 million onetime cost to achieve estimate for Corebridge Forward. Year-to-date, we've incurred about $120 million of separation costs, which are reported as a component of separation costs below the line.  \n Turning to Page 9 in our presentation. The annual actuarial assumption review lowered adjusted pretax operating income by $57 million in the third quarter as compared to $226 million reduction in the prior year and had a de minimis impact to pretax income in the third quarter versus $144 million reduction in the prior year quarter.  \n There were no significant reserve adjustments this quarter. Specifically, there were no reserve changes to universal life with secondary guarantees, which is a small portfolio for us, representing less than 2% of our net liabilities. We continue to believe our lapse rate assumptions for universal life with secondary guarantees are reasonable and supportable. \n For U.S. GAAP, we assume ultimate lapse rates of approximately 1%, while we assume 0% lapses for statutory purposes. The results of the annual assumption review performed in the third quarter principally reflect the impact of a significant rise in interest rates over a relatively short period of time driving up expected fixed annuity lapse rates, resulting in a modest acceleration of DAC amortization. I would also note that the annual actuarial assumption review does not reflect the potential positive impact of rising interest rates on new business margins.  \n Moving on to our businesses, I'll begin with our largest segment, Individual Retirement. In terms of core earnings sources, base spread income was up nearly 8% over the last year driven by spread expansion, while fee income declined 19% year-over-year due to lower asset valuations. Base net investment spreads increased by 28 basis points sequentially and 8 basis points on a year-over-year basis. \n We're encouraged by the operating environment for Individual Retirement and the collective growth of our fixed and fixed index annuity books. Our positive net flows, strong new business margins and expanding spreads continue to improve portfolio profitability. As Kevin noted, our ability to pivot between spread-based and fee-based products in this segment is a strategic advantage.  \n Similar to Individual Retirement, Group Retirement base spreads income rose 4% over the last year due to spread expansion. Fee income declined 18% year-over-year due to lower asset valuation. Base net investment spreads increased by approximately 25 basis points sequentially and 7 basis points on a year-over-year basis. \n In terms of underwriting margin in our Life Insurance business, third quarter results, excluding variable investment income, improved 64% year-on-year. This significant increase in underwriting margin was driven by improved mortality experience on both a COVID and non-COVID basis. \n Our third quarter COVID losses of $28 million were largely consistent with the second quarter and in line with our previously provided sensitivity, while our non-COVID mortality emerged favorable to expectations.  \n In terms of earnings sources for our Institutional Markets business, base spread income increased 11% versus a year ago due to growth in the pension risk transfer portfolio as well as spread expansion. Fee income and underwriting margins were relatively stable. \n We're encouraged by the growth of Institutional Markets, reflecting consistent reserve growth, strong new business margins and expanding spreads, which we expect will continue to improve profitability.  \n I would now like to provide some comments about our capital and liquidity. Adjusted book value as of September 30 was $21.9 billion or $33.90 per share, up 4% from the second quarter. This growth reflects our earnings as well as net realized gains reported below the line. \n Our third quarter Life Fleet RBC remains above our target of 400%. We estimate the third quarter to be in the range of 410% to 420%, reflecting adjustments for certain timing items. This is generally in line with the previous quarter. The Life Fleet RBC is down from year-end 2021 principally because of our decision to accelerate cash distributions made by our insurance subsidiaries to establish Corebridge's holding company liquidity.  \n For the 9 months of 2022, our insurance companies have distributed approximately $2 billion, which is comparable to the normalized distributions for the full 12 months of 2021, which were $2.2 billion. \n In total, the accelerated insurance company distributions accounted for a decline of 51 RBC points for the Life Fleet since the beginning of the year, which compares to an actual decline of 21 to 37 points (sic) [ 27 to 37 points ]. This demonstrates we had positive capital generation during a period of significant market volatility and increasing sales activity.  \n Our holding company liquidity was $2 billion, and our financial leverage was 29.2%, both as of September 30. The roughly 80 basis points increase in the leverage ratio comes as we've taken steps towards finalizing Corebridge's capital structure. \n We continue to expect that our balance sheet will naturally delever as a result of book value growth, and our next debt maturity is not until 2025. \n We paid $148 million dividend in October, our first public company quarterly dividend, and we declared our fourth quarter dividend yesterday, which will be paid on December 30. This translates into a dividend yield over 4% based upon the IPO price. \n We intend to continue paying a quarterly dividend of approximately $150 million to our shareholders, aggregating to approximately $600 million per year. Recent market conditions do not alter our ability to deliver that dividend, nor do they change our capital management plan, including returning capital to shareholders beyond dividends beginning in 2023.  \n With respect to LDTI, our estimate of the initial transition adjustment to adopt LDTI as of January 1, 2021, is closer to the bottom end of the range of our previously disclosed pretax range of $1 billion to $3 billion net reduction to GAAP shareholders' equity. This represents a reduction in AOCI that's partially offset by an increase in retained earnings. This limited book value impact reflects the benefit of having a diversified balance sheet.  \n In addition, we expect LDTI to reduce the current volatility in our operating results given changes to accounting for market risk benefits, DAC and life insurance products. While we will provide additional information in advance of the first time we report on an LDTI basis for the first quarter of 2023, it's also  remember -- it's also important to remember that LDTI does not impact our statutory results nor our insurance company cash flows.  \n As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect continued pressure on variable investment income, as our alternative investments are mostly reported on a 1 quarter lag and have a high correlation to equity markets. \n At the same time, we expect continued depressed levels of call-and-tender income as well as commercial mortgage loan prepayment activity. Also keep in mind that our fourth quarter EPS will include the full impact of our employee stock-based compensation, which we estimate will result in fully diluted shares of approximately $653 million. \n To wrap up, we're pleased with the progress we're making on our strategies to improve profitability. In the context of the current market environment, Corebridge produced a very good third quarter earnings, as evidenced by our robust sales, increasing base spread income and favorable mortality experience. We remain confident in the strength and resiliency of our capital, liquidity and balance sheet. \n And now I will hand it back to Kevin. \nKevin Hogan: Thank you. And operator, we're now prepared for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler. \nJohn Barnidge: You talked about improvement in life insurance mortality experience. Can you maybe talk about non-COVID mortality? And then did the normal seasonality of the business return where 3Q is in a pre-COVID world were the best quarter for mortality experience, at least domestically? \nKevin Hogan: Yes. Thanks, John. Appreciate it. So when it comes down to mortality, first of all, the whole COVID event for us has been on earnings, not a capital event. And from the beginning of the pandemic, our projected sensitivity of $65 million to $75 million of COVID losses for every 100,000 population deaths has held up. And indeed, in the third quarter, we were once again within that sensitivity range. \n And so noting the COVID activity, the third quarter mortality, all in, including COVID, was better than our expected pricing levels. So the non-COVID mortality also continued to perform well, and that's the second quarter in a row that we've had all-in mortality better than our pricing expectations. \n And as we look at mortality, as part of the third quarter review, the data that we've seen suggests no need to change our long-term assumptions. So we do consider that the COVID event was the exception, and we expect our sensitivity to continue to hold up. \n What the future holds for COVID remains unpredictable. We would expect our sensitivity to remain valid. And in the event that there is some kind of resurgence in activity, then we'll be prepared to serve our customers as we always have. \nJohn Barnidge: And for my follow-up question, can you talk about back-to-school season for VALIC from a distribution perspective? It seems like this was the first normal back-to-school year since 2019. \nKevin Hogan: So our Group Retirement business is extremely well positioned. We have been investing in this platform, as you know, for the 5 last years, and we've dramatically upgraded both our plan sponsor and plan participant experience, as has been noted by some of the external surveys that are done relative to capabilities there. \n And we had a very strong growth in deposits in VALIC, 11% year-over-year, and feel great about where the business is positioned. As you know, we really emphasize the role of the value of the adviser, and we focus on those plans that value the role of the adviser. \n And we're on track for a strong year in new plan acquisition as well as increasing periodic deposits. So we feel great about the start to the school season for VALIC, and the business is very well positioned strategically. \n Now in terms of VALIC, I just want to comment on the flows, right, because we get questions on those. Not every dollar of flow is equal. And first thing I would say is that all of our outflows in VALIC are in guaranteed minimum interest rate business above 2%, most of it above 3%, whereas all of the inflows are actually GMIRs below 2% or our very attractive advisory and brokerage platform. \n And as we stated in the Q, right, our net flow definition doesn't include net new assets in the advisory and brokerage platform, which amounted to $500 million in the third quarter and $1.6 billion year-to-date. So despite the fact that the reported flows, our outflows, the economic quality of the overall inflows is improving. \nOperator: Our next question comes from \n [Audio Gap] \nUnknown Analyst: Operation from AIG or the overall environment or capital levels or otherwise that would -- that you're watching after [indiscernible] your own buybacks or start buybacks. \nKevin Hogan: Yes. Thanks, Jimmy. So look, we're off to what we think is a very good start as a public company, and we're confident in achieving our financial targets, 12% to 14% ROE in 24 months. We are executing on the underlying strategies to achieve that and making significant progress. \n Our diversified business model shows great value at a time like this, the multiple products, the multiple channels and sources of earnings that we have facilitated for us to pivot to our spread businesses, which we have a long history in managing and which are demonstrating some of the most attractive margins that we've seen in years. \n But we have many levers to pull in order to achieve our targets. Part of that is obviously our participation in this upside rate environment. Part of that is the expense reduction plan, which Elias touched on a little bit. Part of it is our overall investment strategy, and part of it is our active capital management. \n And we're making excellent progress against all of these levers. We don't need for every single lever to be successful in order for us to have the financial flexibility by the second quarter of next year, to engage in share repurchases beyond our dividend commitment. And we have every confidence in doing so. \nUnknown Analyst: Okay. And then in terms of your individual retirement flows, obviously, the interest rate environment is benefiting everybody. How is competition in the market? Because a lot of companies have reported very strong fixed annuity flows with just the benefit of higher interest rates. \n So is the market still rational? Or are you seeing some companies get more aggressive with terms and conditions given higher human yields? \nKevin Hogan: So we're very comfortable with our position in fixed annuity. As you know, it's one of our competitive strengths. And we've long been a participant in this business, so we have a deep level of expertise and experience. We feel good about our position because in order to be successful managing a fixed annuity portfolio over time, there's really 4 important components. \n First, you have to have the products and the distribution relationships in order to be able to respond to market needs. The second is you really have to understand policyholder behavior, including surrenders, especially in the face of changing interest rates and credit spreads and investor appetites. \n The third is it's very important to proactively manage crediting rates and understand the underlying economics. And especially at a time like this when rates are rising, lapses are expected to rise. And making the right economic choice as to accepting a lapse as opposed to changing a crediting rate is a very important element of the strategy. \n And then the fourth is managing the asset portfolio to be in position to support the crediting rate activities that are appropriate. And we are well prepared relative to liquidity, relative to the increasing lapse rates. And frankly, the margins that we're seeing right now are the most attractive that we've seen in many years. \n So we haven't seen irrational competition to date. The margins are very attractive. We have the ability to rapidly change our crediting rates, so we can compete in the micro cycles that exist. And to the extent that conditions continue as they are now, we still see attractive margins in this business. \nUnknown Analyst: Okay. If I could just ask one other quick one. You had a $41 million impact from the unwind of securitizations with AIG. Is that all done? Or could there be more similar items in future periods? \nKevin Hogan: Elias? \nElias Habayeb: Jimmy, it's Elias. So there is going to be a trailing impact into the fourth quarter, but that's it. \nUnknown Analyst: Okay. A similar amount? \nElias Habayeb: It's mostly -- it could be a small gain, but we have to see where the quarter ends in the fourth quarter. It's mark-to-market from there. We're unwinding. It will be done in the fourth quarter with it. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Nigel Dally from Morgan Stanley. \nNigel Dally: Question on your investment portfolio repositioning. You commented that you're ahead of plan with regards to transferring assets to Blackstone. So just wanted to clarify, is the benefit already in your base yield? Or is there additional incremental upside to those resets we should expect? \nKevin Hogan: So our relationship with Blackstone is excellent. The partnership is off to a really strong start and working well, and the assets that they're originating are an important part of our asset mix needed to support our new business. \n I would say what we're -- we've transferred the $50 billion to them, and they're reinvesting the $50 billion and are doing a great job for us so far. So Elias, maybe you can just unpack a little bit where we're seeing this and where we see this go. \nElias Habayeb: Nigel, so as you know, we transferred $50 billion to Blackstone. On the original $50 billion, they're reinvesting the principal pay downs. And year-to-date, they've invested about $5 billion for us through the end of September. So I look at it that this is the beginning of a longer partnership, and there's more value to come in. \n But if you look at the original $50 billion they invested for us, on a year-to-date basis, the gross yield has been about 6%. So that component is starting to earn in, but I do expect more as time comes by. \n I think it's also on the subject of base yield. We had a significant increase from the second quarter into the third quarter to unpack it. And that's a combination of, I would put it, reinvesting maturing money at higher yields right now. It's floating rate resets as well as new money that's coming into the portfolio that's coming from growth. \n And the Blackstone -- the value that Blackstone brings in is being picked up in that map, but it's still at the infant stage. Come November, we would start allocating to Blackstone the first annual $8.5 billion, which would be allocated over the course of the next 12 months. And so what their impact on our portfolio is just going to increase from here. \nNigel Dally: Got it. That's good color. I just wanted to follow up on expense reduction. $110 million out of the $400 million has been achieved.  Timing for the remainder, relatively linear, a little back-end loaded? Just any additional color on there as well. \nElias Habayeb: So we're ahead of schedule from where we expect it to be just a few months ago. Our target was to get to $100 million of the $400 million by the end of this year. And we got there by the end of September, and we're actually a little ahead of the $100 million. \n We continue to expect that the majority of the $400 million will be done in the next 24 months from the IPO, which is similar to the time line we provided before, and that would be on a run rate basis. And we're always looking for opportunities to accelerate the programs, so we can get the benefit of the efficiencies sooner. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. \nErik Bass: So certainly nice to see the inflection in base spreads this quarter. I was just hoping you could give some color around what you'd expect for the magnitude of base spread improvement over the next 12 months, I guess, if interest rates hold here. \nKevin Hogan: Yes, sure. Erik, thanks. So look, I mean, the diversification of our business model where we have choices as to where to pivot, where the risk-adjusted returns the most attractive is definitely paying off for us right now. \n The upside from the rate environment, net of crediting, net of a reduced call tender and prepay activity and net of reductions in fees is more than enough to offset any of the impact on fees from the equity markets. \n The sensitivity, the 100 basis points yielding $165 million uplift in year 1 and $365 million in year 3 as a linear sensitivity that you can point to. And what we're seeing right now, conditions-wise, externally, the margins are very attractive. \n We have multiple levers to pull in the event that the external environment were to change. We don't need an environment like this in which to be successful. But we're certainly seeing very attractive conditions now. \n As Elias pointed out, our new money rates are 6% on average. That's up 200 basis points over the base yield. We're up 300 basis points since the beginning of the year, and we're now seeing it start to come into the base spreads. \n Now the change in the base spread is not going to be linear. And as Elias pointed out, there is some floating rate resets and things like that included in the change in the base spreads, but we certainly expect an upward direction. \nElias Habayeb: Yes, I would echo that. Our expectation with the current market environment is our base spread income will continue to increase. Our base net spreads will continue to benefit from this environment. Now the quantum and the -- of the improvement from this point is going to depend on the number of variables. But I think looking at their sensitivities is a good proxy. \nErik Bass: Got it. And then can you just talk about how you're thinking about kind of the current level of excess capital that you're carrying and how that positions you for capital return in 2023? \nKevin Hogan: Yes. Look, we're in a strong capital position, strong liquidity position. We have RBC above our target. And we created these strong positions, while supporting significant growth in our spread businesses. And we're very intentional about our capital management philosophy. \n We're committed to our dividends, $600 million a year, payable quarterly, and we've already begun to deliver on that. We expect to have the financial flexibility to engage in share repurchases by the second quarter of next year, especially in the event that AIG were to engage in any secondary activity. \n And we also have the financial flexibility to invest in this very attractive new business and focus on where the risk-adjusted returns are the highest. And so that's our philosophy. \n I don't know, Elias, if you want to add anything. \nElias Habayeb: I think you covered the kind of our philosophy real well. We feel very comfortable with our capital position today. And when we think of capital, Erik, we look at where we are relative to our target, but as well as where does the parent liquidity stand and our leverage profile. \n So collectively, we feel we're in a strong position. And given the diversified nature of our balance sheet and earnings sources, which have helped us over time and when the markets go sideways, we kind of feel comfortable about it going into '23. \nErik Bass: And just one quick technical follow-up. You mentioned 2Q '23 for buybacks. Is there something technical that would prohibit you from doing it, being in the market prior to that? \nElias Habayeb: So we're working through our position to be there. As Peter said on the AIG earnings call, the next windows are either March or May. And from our perspective, we're working to be in a position to participate if AIG chooses to go -- to do a secondary in 1 of those 2 windows. But for us, all options are on the table beyond that. But there's nothing technical other than just prioritizing the capital. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies. \nSuneet Kamath: Just wanted to ask on the $2 billion of distributions that you made from your subsidiaries year-to-date being sort of in line with last year, was there anything unusual on the year-to-date basis that caused that number to be higher? And are you anticipating taking another distribution out in the fourth quarter? \nElias Habayeb: So Suneet, it's Elias. So the distributions for '22 were done by design given we knew we needed to establish a strong parent liquidity, and we knew we had onetime expenses with separation in our expense program. So we front-loaded it. And given where we ended up with an RBC at 2000 -- end of '21, we felt comfortable with that. And that's kind of the -- so it's by design why we front-loaded it. \n We do expect another distribution in the fourth quarter, but we're pretty close to what we did for the entire year of 2021. That was about $2.2 billion. So we're pretty close in the ZIP code, so it may not be a big distribution. \nSuneet Kamath: Got it. And then in terms of your assumption review, is there anything that you're doing on like a statutory basis that could impact year-end capital? And any thoughts on -- maybe you can just remind us what level of AAT reserves did you guys put up last year? Because I'm assuming that could be a tailwind as we get into fourth quarter. \nElias Habayeb: So let me take that. So we've done most of the -- for GAAP, we're done in the third quarter. What we have left is the standard year-end actuarial stuff we do for stat, and so that gets done in the fourth quarter there. I don't have the number of what we put up for cash flow testing last year, but we could follow up on that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Ward from Citi. \nMichael Ward: I was wondering if you could comment on how you see the ownership of your parent company trending over the next several years. I guess, like in your plan, do you have any kind of ultimate ownership level or AIG involvement over time incorporated as you think about it? \nKevin Hogan: Well, I mean, that's a question not so much for us. I think that Peter's comments in AIG's public disclosures are pretty clear in terms of their intentions, and I'd refer to those. \nElias Habayeb: Yes. And the other thing I would add is I'd refer to the S-1, whereby AIG's rights and how they evolve over different ownership levels are pretty -- are disclosed in the S-1. \nMichael Ward: Okay. And maybe on pension risk transfer, just curious about the level of competition in that market. I think it's been a bright spot for the industry recently. And I was wondering if there's any kind of not target, but like sensitivity accretion, dollars of operating earnings per $1 billion of PRT business, for example, like an ROA of some sort. If you could help us understand the financials behind PRT. \nKevin Hogan: Sure. Well, like all of our business, Michael, we look at multiple lenses. We look at an economic lens. We look at a stat lens. We look at a gap lens. And in some cases, we look at our tax lens as well. And each business has appropriate hurdles relative to those, and they're all consistent with our medium-term return targets. \n Pension risk transfer is a very attractive business for us. And some 5-plus years ago, we decided to focus on full plan terminations. We built a specific proprietary administrative capability to focus on full plan terminations. \n And these are more complex. There are fewer participants. There's less competition. And so we found that they have more attractive margins than the more commodity longevity oriented programs. \n And the reality is with the current circumstances, we're finding more and more plans being fully funded. And so with the urgency that companies have to derisk, full plan terminations are getting larger, both in the U.S. and the U.K. marketplaces. And so we're seeing a very strong pipeline in full plan terminations. \n We take a look at the jumbo commodity longevity deals, but we haven't found the economics attractive. And frankly, our partnership with Blackstone also is going to be helpful to us because they're expanding their tremendous origination capabilities across the duration spectrum, which will also help us support our pension risk transfer business. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Krueger from KBW. \nRyan Krueger: My first question is on the base yield. Can you help us understand how much of the 25 basis point sequential improvement was driven by floaters relative to the other impacts? \nElias Habayeb: Ryan, it's Elias. The floaters in the quarter was roughly half of the pickup, and that was driven by the significant increase in rates in such a short period of time. That being said, we -- overall, when we look the -- at our portfolio yield, and for base NII, we look at it as being pretty sustainable given all the different factors that are playing into it, not just the floating rate reset, but also the reinvestment at higher rates, as well as what's being driven by new business growth. \n Our general account overall had positive inflows in the quarter, north of $1 billion, even though we saw a pickup in surrenders and fixed annuities, both in Group and Individual Retirement. \nRyan Krueger: Great. And then you didn't call anything out, but were there any negative impacts in Individual Retirement outside of the assumption review that was related to the equity market weakness in the quarter? \nElias Habayeb: Yes. So you've got -- if you want to unpack Individual Retirement, you've got the impact of the annual actuarial review. That was like an $85 million, $86 million impact. \n Also variable investment income, so PE -- are not also for us are primarily PE and equity real estate. They were down because they're on a 1 quarter lag and reflect what happened last quarter, and there was hardly any calling tender activity in the quarter. So that's also down. \n And then with respect to equity markets, DAC and SOP 03-1, those are sensitive to where equity markets closed at the end of the quarter. So they were down this quarter relative to the prior year. They weren't as impacted as much in Q3 as much as Q2, but they're below expectation. Now the accounting for DAC and SOP 03-1 is going to change come January, and we'll be restating '21 and '22 to be on an LDTI basis. \n So there are a number of things that impacted this quarter from there. But the core, if you look at the business, more than 60% of the earnings comes through spread income. And if you look at the base spread, the experiences, a meaningful improvement, in part driven by the growth you're seeing in the book and in part that's driven by the higher new money yields we're experiencing in the market. \nRyan Krueger: Can you quantify the DAC and SOP impact relative to what you'd normally expect? \nElias Habayeb: I would put it in about roughly $50 million for the segment. If it was much stable markets, we would have had $50 million higher earnings because of DAC and SOP 03-1. \n And then Ryan, just one thing to add, on top, we have a smaller impact on DAC and SOP in Group, and that's about, I would say, relative to stable markets would be about $10 million there. Those are the 2 segments that are impacted in that manner. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. \nElyse Greenspan: My first question on pension risk transfer, can you just talk to how you think about the capital requirements for new business? And if there is upside in sales, how much capital would you think about allocating towards PRT deals? \nKevin Hogan: So the capital intensity of our businesses across the various portfolios is roughly comparable. And in terms of our capital management strategy, Elyse, as I pointed out, I mean, our priorities are making sure that we fund the dividends, that we're in a position to engage in the repurchases. And then a certain amount of capital, we can have the flexibility to invest in new business. \n We will optimize that based on where the risk-adjusted returns are the highest and where the customer needs are the greatest. Now, right now, spread businesses have very attractive margins. And so we see great opportunities in fixed annuities, index annuities and also in pension risk transfers. But we will be very thoughtful about how much marginal capital we allocate to new business and ensure that we're optimizing rather than over-allocating. \nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then on the cost savings program, should the majority come through corporate or through the segments in terms of the saves in the near term? And will you guys kind of call out where that falls into by segment on a quarterly basis? \nElias Habayeb: Elyse, it's Elias. So the savings is across the board. It's not just targeting to the corporate center, but both the insurance companies as well as the corporate center will benefit. \n For example, part of where the savings is coming from is we're expanding our outsourcing relationships with Accenture, and one of it is in our insurance company operations, where we're seeing kind of -- so some savings will come through that. \n We will take it under consideration kind of as to how much transparency we can give in the future, but we did provide something already in the earnings deck on the savings so far. \nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then one last one. You guys have $2 billion at the holdco. Is there a level that you guys like to have just in normal times or something that you're pointing to once you start buying back your shares? \nElias Habayeb: So yes, so our philosophy around the parent liquidity is we want to hold enough liquidity to cover 1 year's worth of parent expenses. Those are higher on the -- at the beginning given some of the onetime expenses I referenced in my prepared remarks. \n And I expect that, as we work through these expenses, the run rate from a parent liquidity would be more in line to cover the parent's fixed cost. And I consider the dividend to external shareholders as part of that. \n So if you think about it's going to be primarily our debt service cost and our dividend is what we will get to once we're done with the onetime expenses. So the balance of the parent, I would expect, as a result, will come down over time. \n But what we're going to -- what we plan to do and we know we can is our insurance companies, if you look historically at their distributions, they've been pretty consistent. We expect that trend line to continue and may improve over time as we improve profitability inside the insurance company, and that excess is what we will use to return back to shareholders in form of share repurchases. \nOperator: Okay. Our final question is from Tom Gallagher from Evercore. \nThomas Gallagher: Elias, just a follow-up on that question on the amount of holding company liquidity you would expect to maintain, let's say, in the first year and then what it would look like beyond that. If I do the math, are we talking about, what, $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion as kind of a target in a range for year 1 grading down to closer to $1 billion in year 2? Is that directionally the way to think about levels of holdco liquidity that you'd be targeting? \nElias Habayeb: So the way I think about it, Tom, is our debt service cost would be about $400 million to $500 million a year. Our dividends to shareholders, $600 million. So let's say that's $1.1 billion. That's sort of the go-forward run rate that I would expect us to be holding. \n Between now and then, I referenced in my comments, we had about $350 million to $450 million of cost to complete the separation from AIG, and we have about $300 million of cost to affect our share -- sorry, our expense reduction program. \n So we have to fund that. Right now, the plan is to fund it from the parent. So I think if you take that, we expect the onetime costs to be largely done by the end of 2023. So if you factor that in, I think that should give you the building blocks of what's the right number to be thinking about. \nThomas Gallagher: That's great. Yes, that gives me what I need. My follow-up is on the individual fixed annuity blocks. Spreads are very wide there, but your lapse rate moved up to, looks like, 9.6% this quarter. Do you need to start becoming more competitive on the cost of fund side as these lapses are moving up? Or how do you see that trade-off going forward? \nKevin Hogan: Yes. Thanks, Tom. So as I pointed out, we have a lot of experience in this business. And one of the important things is understanding policyholder behavior. We do have a dynamic lapse model that we model based on changes in interest rates and credit spreads. And what we believe the lapse results will be that we can make economic decisions around the relative benefit of changing crediting rates as opposed to accepting the lapses. \n So far, what we've seen is behavior that is within the expectations of our model for which we are well prepared.  And we will continue to monitor the environment and actively manage our crediting rate strategy relative to where the economics make sense. \n But right now, we're seeing behaviors that are well within our expectations and, in many cases, below our expectations, so we continue to have flexibility there. \n And irrespective of the lapse rate, I think what's important is that, because of our ability to originate new business and the tremendous distribution relationships that we have, we also have a strong position of inflows. \n And maybe Elias, if you can just unpack a little bit beyond the lapse rate where we're seeing the actual overall flows in the general account. \nElias Habayeb: Yes, if you look at the general account and if you look at Individual Retirement alone, forget the other businesses, the index annuity and the fixed annuity products are both general account products largely. Between the two, we had over $1 billion of inflows into the account. \n So we're not worried from a liquidity perspective on the account or disintermediation because we still have net inflows. We are growing the business, plus we've got strong liquidity in the insurance companies. \nKevin Hogan: Yes. And because we're well positioned relative to liquidity, since we anticipate environments like this, we're not having to engage in anything like asset sales or whatnot to support the lapses. \nOperator: I will now hand you back to Kevin Hogan for closing remarks. \nKevin Hogan: Okay. Thank you for sharing part of your morning with us. The third quarter was the first step in our journey as Corebridge Financial, and I could not be more pleased, as Corebridge works hard each day to make it possible for more people to take action towards their future goals supported by our broad suite of retirement solutions and insurance products. Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Elias Habayeb",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. I will provide more details about our financial results and key performance metrics as well as a few updates on the fourth quarter.  \n Corebridge's performance during the third quarter demonstrates the power of our franchise and the competitive strength of our businesses. We delivered strong growth in our diversified product offerings, with premiums and deposits increasing 23% year-over-year. \n In addition, and for the first time in many years, the base yield in our insurance companies as well as the base net investment spread in both of our retirement businesses expanded on a sequential basis as well as on a year-over-year basis. We believe this represents a new trend towards further growth in our base spread income.  \n Our balance sheet continues to maintain a healthy buffer to our target RBC ratio and the cash flows distributed by our insurance companies in the first 9 months of this year approximate the total distributions made in the entire prior year. \n This morning, we reported third quarter adjusted ROAE of 6.8% and operating EPS of $0.57, which includes notable items that lowered our operating EPS by $0.07. In addition, alternative investment returns were below long-term expectations by approximately $0.16, and COVID mortality losses in the quarter amounted to $0.03. Details are provided on Page 5 of the earnings presentation available on our website.  \n Adjusted pretax operating income, or APTOI, was $423 million, approximately $449 million below a year ago. The decrease in APTOI was driven by approximately a $785 million reduction due to the impact of market conditions on variable investment income, DAC amortization, SOP 03-1 reserves and fee income, as well as structural changes associated with the debt capitalization of Corebridge and divestitures completed in 2021. \n This was offset in part by increasing base spread income, improving overall mortality experience, lower expenses and a comparatively better impact from the annual actuarial assumption review.  \n Turning to earnings. The strength and diversification of our core earnings power is readily apparent when you break down our sources of earnings, which are up 4% year-over-year after excluding variable investment income. Base spread income, which is our largest source of earnings, grew 7% year-over-year. \n The longer lasting benefits of higher new money rates and our partnership with Blackstone continue to emerge with more to earn-in during future quarters as more of the investment portfolio is reinvested at higher yields. Since the beginning of this year, we've seen new money rates increase by approximately 300 basis points, presenting a strong tailwind for our base spread income.  \n Fee income, our second largest source of earnings, is partially a function of underlying asset valuations. Fee income declined 18% versus the prior year quarter due to recent declines in fixed income and equity asset valuations.  And fee income is expected to recover as asset valuations increase. \n Underwriting margin, excluding variable investment income, which is primarily derived from our Life business, rose 62% year-over-year due to improving mortality experience.  \n With respect to net investment income, I would like to focus on our base yield, which was 4.08% for the quarter. The base yield was up 5 basis points year-over-year and was up 24 basis points sequentially. The base yield improvement was driven by a combination of factors that includes reinvestment activities at higher rates, reset on floating rate positions and growth of the overall portfolio. \n New money rates in the quarter were approximately 6%, having increased 300 basis points since the beginning of the year and now exceed base yields by approximately 200 basis points. Accordingly, we have achieved year-over-year spread expansion for the first time in many years. \n Looking forward, while we expect our base yield to continue to benefit from the higher new money rates and floating rate resets, the quantum of the sequential increase will depend on a number of variables, including rates and spreads.  \n Next, I want to provide you an update on Corebridge Forward, our expense reduction and productivity program. As Kevin indicated, as of September 30, we've already achieved over $100 million of the nearly $400 million of run rate savings from Corebridge Forward that we disclosed as part of our IPO. \n The majority of the savings achieved to date represent headcount reductions against our expense baseline, which includes the incremental costs of approximately $300 million to be a separate company. We continue to estimate the onetime cost to achieve of the total $400 million run rate savings program to be in the $300 million range. To date, we've incurred $66 million in costs, which is reported as a component of restructuring and other costs below the line. \n I would note that, while we've been able to eliminate some of the expected increase in corporate expenses, we still expect our corporate expenses to increase to approximately $60 million in the fourth quarter as certain expenses kicked in with the IPO.\n In terms of our separation efforts from AIG, we continue to estimate that the total investment to complete separation will be in the $350 million to $450 million range, in addition to the $300 million onetime cost to achieve estimate for Corebridge Forward. Year-to-date, we've incurred about $120 million of separation costs, which are reported as a component of separation costs below the line.  \n Turning to Page 9 in our presentation. The annual actuarial assumption review lowered adjusted pretax operating income by $57 million in the third quarter as compared to $226 million reduction in the prior year and had a de minimis impact to pretax income in the third quarter versus $144 million reduction in the prior year quarter.  \n There were no significant reserve adjustments this quarter. Specifically, there were no reserve changes to universal life with secondary guarantees, which is a small portfolio for us, representing less than 2% of our net liabilities. We continue to believe our lapse rate assumptions for universal life with secondary guarantees are reasonable and supportable. \n For U.S. GAAP, we assume ultimate lapse rates of approximately 1%, while we assume 0% lapses for statutory purposes. The results of the annual assumption review performed in the third quarter principally reflect the impact of a significant rise in interest rates over a relatively short period of time driving up expected fixed annuity lapse rates, resulting in a modest acceleration of DAC amortization. I would also note that the annual actuarial assumption review does not reflect the potential positive impact of rising interest rates on new business margins.  \n Moving on to our businesses, I'll begin with our largest segment, Individual Retirement. In terms of core earnings sources, base spread income was up nearly 8% over the last year driven by spread expansion, while fee income declined 19% year-over-year due to lower asset valuations. Base net investment spreads increased by 28 basis points sequentially and 8 basis points on a year-over-year basis. \n We're encouraged by the operating environment for Individual Retirement and the collective growth of our fixed and fixed index annuity books. Our positive net flows, strong new business margins and expanding spreads continue to improve portfolio profitability. As Kevin noted, our ability to pivot between spread-based and fee-based products in this segment is a strategic advantage.  \n Similar to Individual Retirement, Group Retirement base spreads income rose 4% over the last year due to spread expansion. Fee income declined 18% year-over-year due to lower asset valuation. Base net investment spreads increased by approximately 25 basis points sequentially and 7 basis points on a year-over-year basis. \n In terms of underwriting margin in our Life Insurance business, third quarter results, excluding variable investment income, improved 64% year-on-year. This significant increase in underwriting margin was driven by improved mortality experience on both a COVID and non-COVID basis. \n Our third quarter COVID losses of $28 million were largely consistent with the second quarter and in line with our previously provided sensitivity, while our non-COVID mortality emerged favorable to expectations.  \n In terms of earnings sources for our Institutional Markets business, base spread income increased 11% versus a year ago due to growth in the pension risk transfer portfolio as well as spread expansion. Fee income and underwriting margins were relatively stable. \n We're encouraged by the growth of Institutional Markets, reflecting consistent reserve growth, strong new business margins and expanding spreads, which we expect will continue to improve profitability.  \n I would now like to provide some comments about our capital and liquidity. Adjusted book value as of September 30 was $21.9 billion or $33.90 per share, up 4% from the second quarter. This growth reflects our earnings as well as net realized gains reported below the line. \n Our third quarter Life Fleet RBC remains above our target of 400%. We estimate the third quarter to be in the range of 410% to 420%, reflecting adjustments for certain timing items. This is generally in line with the previous quarter. The Life Fleet RBC is down from year-end 2021 principally because of our decision to accelerate cash distributions made by our insurance subsidiaries to establish Corebridge's holding company liquidity.  \n For the 9 months of 2022, our insurance companies have distributed approximately $2 billion, which is comparable to the normalized distributions for the full 12 months of 2021, which were $2.2 billion. \n In total, the accelerated insurance company distributions accounted for a decline of 51 RBC points for the Life Fleet since the beginning of the year, which compares to an actual decline of 21 to 37 points (sic) [ 27 to 37 points ]. This demonstrates we had positive capital generation during a period of significant market volatility and increasing sales activity.  \n Our holding company liquidity was $2 billion, and our financial leverage was 29.2%, both as of September 30. The roughly 80 basis points increase in the leverage ratio comes as we've taken steps towards finalizing Corebridge's capital structure. \n We continue to expect that our balance sheet will naturally delever as a result of book value growth, and our next debt maturity is not until 2025. \n We paid $148 million dividend in October, our first public company quarterly dividend, and we declared our fourth quarter dividend yesterday, which will be paid on December 30. This translates into a dividend yield over 4% based upon the IPO price. \n We intend to continue paying a quarterly dividend of approximately $150 million to our shareholders, aggregating to approximately $600 million per year. Recent market conditions do not alter our ability to deliver that dividend, nor do they change our capital management plan, including returning capital to shareholders beyond dividends beginning in 2023.  \n With respect to LDTI, our estimate of the initial transition adjustment to adopt LDTI as of January 1, 2021, is closer to the bottom end of the range of our previously disclosed pretax range of $1 billion to $3 billion net reduction to GAAP shareholders' equity. This represents a reduction in AOCI that's partially offset by an increase in retained earnings. This limited book value impact reflects the benefit of having a diversified balance sheet.  \n In addition, we expect LDTI to reduce the current volatility in our operating results given changes to accounting for market risk benefits, DAC and life insurance products. While we will provide additional information in advance of the first time we report on an LDTI basis for the first quarter of 2023, it's also  remember -- it's also important to remember that LDTI does not impact our statutory results nor our insurance company cash flows.  \n As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect continued pressure on variable investment income, as our alternative investments are mostly reported on a 1 quarter lag and have a high correlation to equity markets. \n At the same time, we expect continued depressed levels of call-and-tender income as well as commercial mortgage loan prepayment activity. Also keep in mind that our fourth quarter EPS will include the full impact of our employee stock-based compensation, which we estimate will result in fully diluted shares of approximately $653 million. \n To wrap up, we're pleased with the progress we're making on our strategies to improve profitability. In the context of the current market environment, Corebridge produced a very good third quarter earnings, as evidenced by our robust sales, increasing base spread income and favorable mortality experience. We remain confident in the strength and resiliency of our capital, liquidity and balance sheet. \n And now I will hand it back to Kevin. Jimmy, it's Elias. So there is going to be a trailing impact into the fourth quarter, but that's it. It's mostly -- it could be a small gain, but we have to see where the quarter ends in the fourth quarter. It's mark-to-market from there. We're unwinding. It will be done in the fourth quarter with it. Nigel, so as you know, we transferred $50 billion to Blackstone. On the original $50 billion, they're reinvesting the principal pay downs. And year-to-date, they've invested about $5 billion for us through the end of September. So I look at it that this is the beginning of a longer partnership, and there's more value to come in. \n But if you look at the original $50 billion they invested for us, on a year-to-date basis, the gross yield has been about 6%. So that component is starting to earn in, but I do expect more as time comes by. \n I think it's also on the subject of base yield. We had a significant increase from the second quarter into the third quarter to unpack it. And that's a combination of, I would put it, reinvesting maturing money at higher yields right now. It's floating rate resets as well as new money that's coming into the portfolio that's coming from growth. \n And the Blackstone -- the value that Blackstone brings in is being picked up in that map, but it's still at the infant stage. Come November, we would start allocating to Blackstone the first annual $8.5 billion, which would be allocated over the course of the next 12 months. And so what their impact on our portfolio is just going to increase from here. So we're ahead of schedule from where we expect it to be just a few months ago. Our target was to get to $100 million of the $400 million by the end of this year. And we got there by the end of September, and we're actually a little ahead of the $100 million. \n We continue to expect that the majority of the $400 million will be done in the next 24 months from the IPO, which is similar to the time line we provided before, and that would be on a run rate basis. And we're always looking for opportunities to accelerate the programs, so we can get the benefit of the efficiencies sooner. Yes, I would echo that. Our expectation with the current market environment is our base spread income will continue to increase. Our base net spreads will continue to benefit from this environment. Now the quantum and the -- of the improvement from this point is going to depend on the number of variables. But I think looking at their sensitivities is a good proxy. I think you covered the kind of our philosophy real well. We feel very comfortable with our capital position today. And when we think of capital, Erik, we look at where we are relative to our target, but as well as where does the parent liquidity stand and our leverage profile. \n So collectively, we feel we're in a strong position. And given the diversified nature of our balance sheet and earnings sources, which have helped us over time and when the markets go sideways, we kind of feel comfortable about it going into '23. So we're working through our position to be there. As Peter said on the AIG earnings call, the next windows are either March or May. And from our perspective, we're working to be in a position to participate if AIG chooses to go -- to do a secondary in 1 of those 2 windows. But for us, all options are on the table beyond that. But there's nothing technical other than just prioritizing the capital. So Suneet, it's Elias. So the distributions for '22 were done by design given we knew we needed to establish a strong parent liquidity, and we knew we had onetime expenses with separation in our expense program. So we front-loaded it. And given where we ended up with an RBC at 2000 -- end of '21, we felt comfortable with that. And that's kind of the -- so it's by design why we front-loaded it. \n We do expect another distribution in the fourth quarter, but we're pretty close to what we did for the entire year of 2021. That was about $2.2 billion. So we're pretty close in the ZIP code, so it may not be a big distribution. So let me take that. So we've done most of the -- for GAAP, we're done in the third quarter. What we have left is the standard year-end actuarial stuff we do for stat, and so that gets done in the fourth quarter there. I don't have the number of what we put up for cash flow testing last year, but we could follow up on that. Yes. And the other thing I would add is I'd refer to the S-1, whereby AIG's rights and how they evolve over different ownership levels are pretty -- are disclosed in the S-1. Ryan, it's Elias. The floaters in the quarter was roughly half of the pickup, and that was driven by the significant increase in rates in such a short period of time. That being said, we -- overall, when we look the -- at our portfolio yield, and for base NII, we look at it as being pretty sustainable given all the different factors that are playing into it, not just the floating rate reset, but also the reinvestment at higher rates, as well as what's being driven by new business growth. \n Our general account overall had positive inflows in the quarter, north of $1 billion, even though we saw a pickup in surrenders and fixed annuities, both in Group and Individual Retirement. Yes. So you've got -- if you want to unpack Individual Retirement, you've got the impact of the annual actuarial review. That was like an $85 million, $86 million impact. \n Also variable investment income, so PE -- are not also for us are primarily PE and equity real estate. They were down because they're on a 1 quarter lag and reflect what happened last quarter, and there was hardly any calling tender activity in the quarter. So that's also down. \n And then with respect to equity markets, DAC and SOP 03-1, those are sensitive to where equity markets closed at the end of the quarter. So they were down this quarter relative to the prior year. They weren't as impacted as much in Q3 as much as Q2, but they're below expectation. Now the accounting for DAC and SOP 03-1 is going to change come January, and we'll be restating '21 and '22 to be on an LDTI basis. \n So there are a number of things that impacted this quarter from there. But the core, if you look at the business, more than 60% of the earnings comes through spread income. And if you look at the base spread, the experiences, a meaningful improvement, in part driven by the growth you're seeing in the book and in part that's driven by the higher new money yields we're experiencing in the market. I would put it in about roughly $50 million for the segment. If it was much stable markets, we would have had $50 million higher earnings because of DAC and SOP 03-1. \n And then Ryan, just one thing to add, on top, we have a smaller impact on DAC and SOP in Group, and that's about, I would say, relative to stable markets would be about $10 million there. Those are the 2 segments that are impacted in that manner. Elyse, it's Elias. So the savings is across the board. It's not just targeting to the corporate center, but both the insurance companies as well as the corporate center will benefit. \n For example, part of where the savings is coming from is we're expanding our outsourcing relationships with Accenture, and one of it is in our insurance company operations, where we're seeing kind of -- so some savings will come through that. \n We will take it under consideration kind of as to how much transparency we can give in the future, but we did provide something already in the earnings deck on the savings so far. So yes, so our philosophy around the parent liquidity is we want to hold enough liquidity to cover 1 year's worth of parent expenses. Those are higher on the -- at the beginning given some of the onetime expenses I referenced in my prepared remarks. \n And I expect that, as we work through these expenses, the run rate from a parent liquidity would be more in line to cover the parent's fixed cost. And I consider the dividend to external shareholders as part of that. \n So if you think about it's going to be primarily our debt service cost and our dividend is what we will get to once we're done with the onetime expenses. So the balance of the parent, I would expect, as a result, will come down over time. \n But what we're going to -- what we plan to do and we know we can is our insurance companies, if you look historically at their distributions, they've been pretty consistent. We expect that trend line to continue and may improve over time as we improve profitability inside the insurance company, and that excess is what we will use to return back to shareholders in form of share repurchases. So the way I think about it, Tom, is our debt service cost would be about $400 million to $500 million a year. Our dividends to shareholders, $600 million. So let's say that's $1.1 billion. That's sort of the go-forward run rate that I would expect us to be holding. \n Between now and then, I referenced in my comments, we had about $350 million to $450 million of cost to complete the separation from AIG, and we have about $300 million of cost to affect our share -- sorry, our expense reduction program. \n So we have to fund that. Right now, the plan is to fund it from the parent. So I think if you take that, we expect the onetime costs to be largely done by the end of 2023. So if you factor that in, I think that should give you the building blocks of what's the right number to be thinking about. Yes, if you look at the general account and if you look at Individual Retirement alone, forget the other businesses, the index annuity and the fixed annuity products are both general account products largely. Between the two, we had over $1 billion of inflows into the account. \n So we're not worried from a liquidity perspective on the account or disintermediation because we still have net inflows. We are growing the business, plus we've got strong liquidity in the insurance companies."

            "name": "Kevin Hogan",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our first earnings call as Corebridge Financial. I am joined today by Elias Habayeb, our Chief Financial Officer.  \n Over the last 2 years, a great number of people from our own team, our parent company AIG and our various partners worked diligently to position Corebridge Financial to become a successful standalone public company. This culminated with our September 15 listing on the New York Stock Exchange. I would like to start by thanking all of those that were involved for their contributions in reaching this milestone.  \n During today's call, I will focus on our financial performance and current market conditions, reinforce our commitment to our stated financial targets, provide an update on recent strategic progress and review our strong financial position. Elias will provide additional detail on our financial results, and then we will take questions.  \n The third quarter was a very good quarter for Corebridge Financial. I am both pleased with our results and confident in our future. We delivered solid sales in the dynamic market. We made significant progress on our core strategies. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we are on pace to deliver an attractive return of capital to shareholders.  \n Corebridge reported operating earnings per share of $0.57 for the third quarter, with an adjusted return on average equity, or adjusted ROAE, of 6.8%. This reflects strong results from our core businesses in the face of a challenging macroeconomic environment that was felt across our industry. \n Recent market dynamics, such as the pullback in equity markets, increased interest rates and widened credit spreads, and resulting asset value reductions affected each of our businesses to different degrees in the quarter. However, I want to emphasize that we expect that short-term market-related impacts should be more than offset over time by the long-term upside we experienced from rising interest rates and the impact that has on driving sales and margin growth. \n The benefits from these conditions began to emerge last quarter, supporting strong new business generation and leading to an inflection point, where historical year-over-year 8 to 16 basis points of base net investment spread compression finally turned from a headwind to a tailwind. We are now seeing spread expansion for the first time in years. Elias will provide more details on this important emerging development.  \n Turning to the financial targets we disclosed as part of the IPO. We remain confident in achieving each of them as we maintain a strong balance sheet and deliver disciplined growth. We have a clear line of sight on achieving an adjusted ROAE of 12% to 14% and delivering a 60% to 65% payout ratio on adjusted after-tax operating income within 24 months from the IPO. \n We expect to deliver capital to our shareholders through a combination of $600 million in annual dividends, along with share repurchases. We have committed to an annual dividend payable quarterly and have already paid our first and declared our second quarterly dividend. And we expect to have the financial flexibility to complement our dividend with additional return of capital to shareholders as early as the second quarter of 2023.  \n Our ability to execute our capital management strategy is based on the strength of our balance sheet, the consistency of our insurance company cash flows and the diversification in our businesses and earnings sources.  \n During the third quarter, we also made significant progress on organic growth, investment partnerships and efficiency strategies. As to organic growth, we delivered a strong quarter with robust sales and deposit flows. All 4 of our businesses delivered year-over-year growth in the quarter, and all 4 were supported by assets originated by Blackstone. \n Our multiple sources of earnings, diversified product platform and network of distribution partners represent a strategic advantage. We are able to pursue profitable organic growth opportunities by focusing where risk-adjusted returns are the most attractive and customer needs the greatest under various market conditions. \n The third quarter once again demonstrated our ability to remain nimble and to pivot between spread-based and fee-based products as capital markets evolve, driving more attractive opportunities for policyholders and for our business in our spread-based products, such as both our fixed and fixed index annuities.\n Fixed index annuity conditions were very appealing across our broad range of channels, supported by our income and accumulation products. We set a company record for sales this quarter with deposits of over $1.7 billion, and we delivered positive net flows of $1.3 billion. \n The strong position and consistent performance of our fixed index annuity business, a core product for us and individual retirement, has yielded over $4 billion of positive net flows over the last 12 months. \n Fixed annuity conditions also remain attractive, where we continue to mobilize our strong position in bank distribution and were further supported by Blackstone's ability to originate attractive assets, leading to fixed annuity sales of approximately $1.3 billion for the third consecutive quarter. \n Overall, individual retirement delivered deposits of $3.8 billion for the quarter, reflecting 17% growth year-over-year and positive net flows of nearly $700 million over the 3-month period.  \n In Group Retirement, deposits were also strong at $2 billion, 11% higher than the prior year quarter, supported in part by new plan acquisitions and growth of out-of-plan deposits, in particular, in fixed annuities.  \n Turning to Life Insurance. While premiums and deposits were consistent year-over-year, they reflect an improving mix of business in the U.S. and a continuing growth trend in the U.K., where we remain optimistic about our international growth prospects. \n And lastly, in Institutional Markets, we had strong GIC issuance of $1 billion, originated $760 million of pension risk transfer transactions and saw inflows to stable value wraps in the face of market uncertainty. We remain focused on full plan terminations in the U.S. and U.K. With attractive funding levels for many plans, our pension risk transfer pipeline remains robust. We also remain confident in our ability to become a more consistent issuer of GICs in the future.  \n Our broad position across products and channels has been especially advantageous, as we have been able to respond effectively to rapidly changing market conditions and investor appetites. \n We are also making good progress in implementing our investment partnerships with both Blackstone and BlackRock. First, Blackstone continues to originate attractive assets across the duration spectrum and volumes that we could not previously achieve, supporting our product competitiveness and recent growth. \n The partnership is running well, with Blackstone managing $50 billion of assets that we transferred at the end of 2021 and reinvesting proceeds from those assets. To date, Blackstone has originated approximately $5 billion of private and structured credit at an average gross yield of 6% and an average credit quality of BBB+. \n This new origination is part of the asset mix that has supported growth in our shorter-dated annuities and is positioned to support our strong pipeline of pension risk transfer opportunities.  \n With respect to BlackRock, we are well ahead of the original schedule to transfer our public liquid assets and some private securities, representing $90 billion in amortized cost and $76 billion in market value. As of today, we have substantially completed these asset transfers. \n We are also in the product -- project planning stages of the Aladdin platform, which will further modernize our infrastructure and provide us with expanded analytics and accounting capabilities.  \n In addition to modernizing our business, we are also driving towards a leaner operating model. Our expense reduction and productivity program, known as Corebridge Forward, includes various initiatives such as leveraging our current outsourcing partnerships, refining our target operating model, modernizing our IT infrastructure and rationalizing our real estate footprint. \n It is expected to generate approximately $400 million of savings on a run rate basis, with the majority achieved within the next 2 years. We have already made meaningful progress and have achieved just over $100 million of run rate savings year-to-date, ahead of the original plan to achieve the initial $100 million of savings by the end of the year. Elias will provide more information on our Corebridge Forward program.  \n Turning to the balance sheet. Our capital, liquidity and leverage positions remain strong, despite recent market conditions. Year-to-date, our insurance companies have distributed $2 billion of dividends and tax-sharing payments tied to tax strategies. Our strong position gives us confidence that we are on the path to deliver on our stated financial commitments.  \n We are excited about our current opportunities and what the future holds for Corebridge. We are gaining momentum from some of the most attractive pricing conditions in recent memory as well as strong tailwinds generated by the rising interest rate environment. We are well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities moving forward while, at the same time, delivering on our capital commitments to shareholders.  \n I will now turn the call over to Elias. Thank you. And operator, we're now prepared for questions. Yes. Thanks, John. Appreciate it. So when it comes down to mortality, first of all, the whole COVID event for us has been on earnings, not a capital event. And from the beginning of the pandemic, our projected sensitivity of $65 million to $75 million of COVID losses for every 100,000 population deaths has held up. And indeed, in the third quarter, we were once again within that sensitivity range. \n And so noting the COVID activity, the third quarter mortality, all in, including COVID, was better than our expected pricing levels. So the non-COVID mortality also continued to perform well, and that's the second quarter in a row that we've had all-in mortality better than our pricing expectations. \n And as we look at mortality, as part of the third quarter review, the data that we've seen suggests no need to change our long-term assumptions. So we do consider that the COVID event was the exception, and we expect our sensitivity to continue to hold up. \n What the future holds for COVID remains unpredictable. We would expect our sensitivity to remain valid. And in the event that there is some kind of resurgence in activity, then we'll be prepared to serve our customers as we always have. So our Group Retirement business is extremely well positioned. We have been investing in this platform, as you know, for the 5 last years, and we've dramatically upgraded both our plan sponsor and plan participant experience, as has been noted by some of the external surveys that are done relative to capabilities there. \n And we had a very strong growth in deposits in VALIC, 11% year-over-year, and feel great about where the business is positioned. As you know, we really emphasize the role of the value of the adviser, and we focus on those plans that value the role of the adviser. \n And we're on track for a strong year in new plan acquisition as well as increasing periodic deposits. So we feel great about the start to the school season for VALIC, and the business is very well positioned strategically. \n Now in terms of VALIC, I just want to comment on the flows, right, because we get questions on those. Not every dollar of flow is equal. And first thing I would say is that all of our outflows in VALIC are in guaranteed minimum interest rate business above 2%, most of it above 3%, whereas all of the inflows are actually GMIRs below 2% or our very attractive advisory and brokerage platform. \n And as we stated in the Q, right, our net flow definition doesn't include net new assets in the advisory and brokerage platform, which amounted to $500 million in the third quarter and $1.6 billion year-to-date. So despite the fact that the reported flows, our outflows, the economic quality of the overall inflows is improving. Yes. Thanks, Jimmy. So look, we're off to what we think is a very good start as a public company, and we're confident in achieving our financial targets, 12% to 14% ROE in 24 months. We are executing on the underlying strategies to achieve that and making significant progress. \n Our diversified business model shows great value at a time like this, the multiple products, the multiple channels and sources of earnings that we have facilitated for us to pivot to our spread businesses, which we have a long history in managing and which are demonstrating some of the most attractive margins that we've seen in years. \n But we have many levers to pull in order to achieve our targets. Part of that is obviously our participation in this upside rate environment. Part of that is the expense reduction plan, which Elias touched on a little bit. Part of it is our overall investment strategy, and part of it is our active capital management. \n And we're making excellent progress against all of these levers. We don't need for every single lever to be successful in order for us to have the financial flexibility by the second quarter of next year, to engage in share repurchases beyond our dividend commitment. And we have every confidence in doing so. So we're very comfortable with our position in fixed annuity. As you know, it's one of our competitive strengths. And we've long been a participant in this business, so we have a deep level of expertise and experience. We feel good about our position because in order to be successful managing a fixed annuity portfolio over time, there's really 4 important components. \n First, you have to have the products and the distribution relationships in order to be able to respond to market needs. The second is you really have to understand policyholder behavior, including surrenders, especially in the face of changing interest rates and credit spreads and investor appetites. \n The third is it's very important to proactively manage crediting rates and understand the underlying economics. And especially at a time like this when rates are rising, lapses are expected to rise. And making the right economic choice as to accepting a lapse as opposed to changing a crediting rate is a very important element of the strategy. \n And then the fourth is managing the asset portfolio to be in position to support the crediting rate activities that are appropriate. And we are well prepared relative to liquidity, relative to the increasing lapse rates. And frankly, the margins that we're seeing right now are the most attractive that we've seen in many years. \n So we haven't seen irrational competition to date. The margins are very attractive. We have the ability to rapidly change our crediting rates, so we can compete in the micro cycles that exist. And to the extent that conditions continue as they are now, we still see attractive margins in this business. Elias? So our relationship with Blackstone is excellent. The partnership is off to a really strong start and working well, and the assets that they're originating are an important part of our asset mix needed to support our new business. \n I would say what we're -- we've transferred the $50 billion to them, and they're reinvesting the $50 billion and are doing a great job for us so far. So Elias, maybe you can just unpack a little bit where we're seeing this and where we see this go. Yes, sure. Erik, thanks. So look, I mean, the diversification of our business model where we have choices as to where to pivot, where the risk-adjusted returns the most attractive is definitely paying off for us right now. \n The upside from the rate environment, net of crediting, net of a reduced call tender and prepay activity and net of reductions in fees is more than enough to offset any of the impact on fees from the equity markets. \n The sensitivity, the 100 basis points yielding $165 million uplift in year 1 and $365 million in year 3 as a linear sensitivity that you can point to. And what we're seeing right now, conditions-wise, externally, the margins are very attractive. \n We have multiple levers to pull in the event that the external environment were to change. We don't need an environment like this in which to be successful. But we're certainly seeing very attractive conditions now. \n As Elias pointed out, our new money rates are 6% on average. That's up 200 basis points over the base yield. We're up 300 basis points since the beginning of the year, and we're now seeing it start to come into the base spreads. \n Now the change in the base spread is not going to be linear. And as Elias pointed out, there is some floating rate resets and things like that included in the change in the base spreads, but we certainly expect an upward direction. Yes. Look, we're in a strong capital position, strong liquidity position. We have RBC above our target. And we created these strong positions, while supporting significant growth in our spread businesses. And we're very intentional about our capital management philosophy. \n We're committed to our dividends, $600 million a year, payable quarterly, and we've already begun to deliver on that. We expect to have the financial flexibility to engage in share repurchases by the second quarter of next year, especially in the event that AIG were to engage in any secondary activity. \n And we also have the financial flexibility to invest in this very attractive new business and focus on where the risk-adjusted returns are the highest. And so that's our philosophy. \n I don't know, Elias, if you want to add anything. Well, I mean, that's a question not so much for us. I think that Peter's comments in AIG's public disclosures are pretty clear in terms of their intentions, and I'd refer to those. Sure. Well, like all of our business, Michael, we look at multiple lenses. We look at an economic lens. We look at a stat lens. We look at a gap lens. And in some cases, we look at our tax lens as well. And each business has appropriate hurdles relative to those, and they're all consistent with our medium-term return targets. \n Pension risk transfer is a very attractive business for us. And some 5-plus years ago, we decided to focus on full plan terminations. We built a specific proprietary administrative capability to focus on full plan terminations. \n And these are more complex. There are fewer participants. There's less competition. And so we found that they have more attractive margins than the more commodity longevity oriented programs. \n And the reality is with the current circumstances, we're finding more and more plans being fully funded. And so with the urgency that companies have to derisk, full plan terminations are getting larger, both in the U.S. and the U.K. marketplaces. And so we're seeing a very strong pipeline in full plan terminations. \n We take a look at the jumbo commodity longevity deals, but we haven't found the economics attractive. And frankly, our partnership with Blackstone also is going to be helpful to us because they're expanding their tremendous origination capabilities across the duration spectrum, which will also help us support our pension risk transfer business. So the capital intensity of our businesses across the various portfolios is roughly comparable. And in terms of our capital management strategy, Elyse, as I pointed out, I mean, our priorities are making sure that we fund the dividends, that we're in a position to engage in the repurchases. And then a certain amount of capital, we can have the flexibility to invest in new business. \n We will optimize that based on where the risk-adjusted returns are the highest and where the customer needs are the greatest. Now, right now, spread businesses have very attractive margins. And so we see great opportunities in fixed annuities, index annuities and also in pension risk transfers. But we will be very thoughtful about how much marginal capital we allocate to new business and ensure that we're optimizing rather than over-allocating. Yes. Thanks, Tom. So as I pointed out, we have a lot of experience in this business. And one of the important things is understanding policyholder behavior. We do have a dynamic lapse model that we model based on changes in interest rates and credit spreads. And what we believe the lapse results will be that we can make economic decisions around the relative benefit of changing crediting rates as opposed to accepting the lapses. \n So far, what we've seen is behavior that is within the expectations of our model for which we are well prepared.  And we will continue to monitor the environment and actively manage our crediting rate strategy relative to where the economics make sense. \n But right now, we're seeing behaviors that are well within our expectations and, in many cases, below our expectations, so we continue to have flexibility there. \n And irrespective of the lapse rate, I think what's important is that, because of our ability to originate new business and the tremendous distribution relationships that we have, we also have a strong position of inflows. \n And maybe Elias, if you can just unpack a little bit beyond the lapse rate where we're seeing the actual overall flows in the general account. Yes. And because we're well positioned relative to liquidity, since we anticipate environments like this, we're not having to engage in anything like asset sales or whatnot to support the lapses. Okay. Thank you for sharing part of your morning with us. The third quarter was the first step in our journey as Corebridge Financial, and I could not be more pleased, as Corebridge works hard each day to make it possible for more people to take action towards their future goals supported by our broad suite of retirement solutions and insurance products. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions]\n I will now hand the floor over to Isil Muderrisoglu to begin the call. Please go ahead. \nIsil Muderrisoglu: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Corebridge Financial earnings update for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. Joining me on the call are Kevin Hogan, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Elias Habayeb, Chief Financial Officer.

Kevin? \nKevin Hogan: Thank you, Isil, and good morning. 2023 was built an important year for Corebridge and a successful one. We executed with focus and determination, capitalized on attractive market opportunities, made tremendous progress on our strategic and operational priorities. And in each and every quarter, we delivered quality financial results. This morning, I will review the first full calendar year for Corebridge through 5 different lenses: profitability, sales, sources of income, operating expenses and capital return. Elias will then provide details on our fourth quarter results and offer some guidance for the year ahead. \n But first, I want to remind you of the value proposition we laid out at our IPO. Corebridge operates 4 market-leading businesses that provide a broad set of protection and retirement solutions to individuals and institutions. We manufacture a wide range of products that appeal to different market segments while also designed to generate attractive returns. We have a high-quality in-force portfolio and have managed it carefully. The diversity in our product suite and the breadth of our distribution strategy allow us to be nimble and react to evolving market conditions. We have the ability to dial up and dial down product sales based on changes in customer demand and where risk-adjusted returns are the most attractive, as evidenced by our recent emphasis on spread-based products, such as fixed annuities, which has grown over 200% since 2020 and, pension risk transfer, which has grown 130% over the same period. \n Our leading distribution platform is also a significant contributor to our agility, with over 1,200 distribution relationships with banks, broker-dealers, wirehouses, independent marketing organizations and general and independent agencies as well as our own financial adviser and our direct channel. We continue to invest in our platforms to improve efficiency, scalability and productivity such as we have been undertaking with Corebridge Forward our modernization program. \n Our competitiveness is further supported by our asset origination capabilities that have been enhanced by our investment partnerships with Blackstone and BlackRock. Our strategy is to grow our company in a way that creates value for both our customers and our shareholders. Collectively, our diversified businesses and dynamic business model have a long track record of delivering attractive financial results and consistent cash flows under different macro environments. Together with our strong balance sheet, we are well positioned to deliver long-term value to our shareholders by remaining focused on improving profitability and returning a meaningful amount of capital. With that as background, I would like to review our 2023 financial results.\n Corebridge is pleased to report very strong results not only for the fourth quarter but also for the full year. We grew 2023 adjusted after-tax operating income to $2.6 billion, a 12% increase year-over-year. Our full year non-GAAP operating earnings per share also rose by 12% to $4.10, and our 2023 adjusted return on average equity increased on a run rate basis to 12.2%, an improvement of over 200 basis points from the prior year. Corebridge drove profitability through strong top line growth, margin expansion and expense efficiency. We benefited from the investments we have made in our operating model, which positioned us to capitalize on historic market opportunities. \n In 2023, we grew premiums and deposits across our broad portfolio of spread-based products by 60%. These products are particularly attractive now, producing strong margins with double-digit IRRs. Looking across the entire Corebridge portfolio, premiums and deposits were $10.5 billion for the fourth quarter and $39.9 billion for the year. The full year volume of almost $40 billion is a new record for us and one of several high watermarks for 2023, including fixed annuities, fixed index annuities, guaranteed investment contracts and pension risk transfer sales. \n Complementing this growth, we leveraged our unique investment platform to scale the origination of attractive assets that are well matched to our liabilities and to opportunistically lock in favorable yields from which we expect to see benefits for years to come. Our new operating model enabled us to rapidly expand capacity to support record sales volumes, especially in the latter part of the year. We also grew our aggregate core sources of income, which increased 12% for the full year to $7.1 billion. Our 4 established businesses generate an attractive mix of spread income, fee income and underwriting margin. We enjoyed meaningful growth of spread income supported by market conditions, while at the same time, fee income stabilized with improved asset valuations and the expansion of our advisory and brokerage business and Group Retirement. And we continue to generate a solid underwriting margin from improved full year mortality experience.\n Taking a look at our spread businesses, we increased full year base spread income by nearly $900 million or 30% to $3.7 billion. We were able to serve our customers and distribution partners' needs with attractive products reflecting some of the most supportive market conditions in recent memory. With interest rates at levels not seen in over a decade, we seized the opportunity. As we look ahead to 2024, the environment remains attractive for new business, and we remain well positioned to serve our markets. \n Although we invested as appropriate to increase our capacity in both sales and operations to support this unique growth opportunity, we also remain steadfastly focused on expenses. Between the fourth quarter of 2022 and the fourth quarter of 2023, we reduced our operating expenses by 14%. A key contributor has been Corebridge Forward. We have achieved or contracted on 88% of our exit run rate savings goal of $400 million, and we expect the vast majority to earn into our results by the end of 2024. This program is near its completion as we transition to a focus on continuous improvement. \n Turning to capital management. We have been clear since the outside of Corebridge that we are committed to deploying capital to create value for shareholders. In 2023, we demonstrated our ability to do this, with strong cash flows from our insurance companies, supported by important strategic transactions. We closed the sale of Laya Healthcare in Ireland and remain on track to close the sale of our U.K. life business in the second quarter of 2024 as we streamline our portfolio with a continuing focus on life and retirement solutions in the United States. Collectively, the sale of our international life operations will generate over $1 billion of value. \n Corebridge returned over $2.2 billion to shareholders in our first full calendar year as a public company, including special dividends, and we remain committed to delivering a 60% to 65% payout ratio in 2024. Our delivery of these attractive levels of shareholder return reflects the confidence we have in our financial position. We entered 2024 with a strong balance sheet and ample levels of liquidity and capital, representing enhanced financial flexibility. For over a decade and across various economic cycles, we have consistently maintained a Life Fleet RBC ratio above our target. At the same time, our insurance companies have distributed over $2 billion annually to our holding company. We are routinely able to maintain healthy capital levels regardless of the macro environment while simultaneously supporting new business volume and robust capital return. \n Finally, I want to turn to the operational separation from AIG. This has been a complex program demanding considerable expertise and coordination, and we are nearing the end of our work. We established the capabilities required of a stand-alone public company, implemented our own capital structure, created and brought to life a new brand and disentangled functions, systems and infrastructure. \n On the IT side, just as one example, we migrated nearly 700 physical applications, hundreds of operating platforms and thousands of end users. These efforts did not distract us from continuing to serve our customers and distribution partners. At the end of 2023, our total spend on operational separation was $425 million. As we said before, some work has indeed extended into 2024, along with a handful of transition services agreements. All of this required an extraordinary effort. For our employees, you have my gratitude. We ask a lot of all of you, and you delivered. I also want to thank our partners and AIG for helping to make our operational separation of success. \n Returning to where I began my remarks, 2023 was our first full calendar year as a public company, and it was a very productive one. The fourth quarter was a strong conclusion to what was a very good year. \n I will now turn the call over to Elias who will go into more detail on the results for the quarter. \nElias Habayeb: Thank you, Kevin. Corebridge delivered excellent results, both in the fourth quarter as well as the full year of 2023 while improving our financial position. We executed across strategic and operational priorities and made significant progress on the financial goals we established at the time of the IPO. Corebridge increased profitability by capitalizing on market opportunities while reducing our operating expenses. We strengthened our core businesses and enhanced our financial flexibility while returning significant capital to shareholders.\n Corebridge reported fourth quarter adjusted pretax operating income of $820 million or earnings per share of $1.04, an increase of 12% year-over-year on a per share basis. Operating EPS included a $0.06 impact from nonrecurring items in our investment portfolio related to a prior period true-up on certain investments. This was offset by a $0.17 impact from alternative investment returns below our long-term expectations. Adjusting for these 2 items, our operating EPS would have been $1.15. This is a 25% improvement year-over-year on a comparative basis.\n Our aggregate core sources of income, which excludes variable investment income, improved year-over-year driven by growth in base spread income and in fee income, partially offset by a reduction in underwriting margin. The increase in base spread income, our largest source of earnings, was driven by higher new money yields and growth of our broad portfolio of spread-based products. On average, new money yields were 7% in the fourth quarter or 190 basis points above yields on assets that matured or were sold in our general accounts. Total invested assets grew by approximately $11 billion.\n The increase in fee income, our second largest source of earnings, reflected the improvements in underlying asset valuations and the expansion of advisory and brokerage services in our Group Retirement segment. The decline in underwriting margin was the result of a higher frequency of smaller claims in our universal life book this quarter and net favorable nonrecurring items impacting our Life Insurance segment in the prior year quarter. \n Pivoting to net investment income. Net investment income for our insurance companies on an APTOI basis improved 16% year-over-year. Base portfolio income grew 17% over the prior year quarter to nearly $2.6 billion. Reported base yields increased 45 basis points year-over-year to 4.87%. Excluding the impact from the aforementioned nonrecurring items, base yields increased 51 basis points over the prior year quarter. \n Based on our current interest rate and net flows outlook for 2024, we expect base portfolio income, along with associated base yield, will continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace. Corebridge improved base yield this quarter while also moving up in credit quality. Our general account investment portfolio is well positioned to perform under various market conditions. It is diversified, actively managed and remains high quality, with an average credit rating of A flat. 95% of fixed maturities were rated in investment grade as of December 31. The credit metrics in our Corebridge fixed income portfolio remained strong, and for the full year, the portfolio experienced net positive rating migrations, with upgrades outpacing downgrades. The credit fundamentals in our commercial mortgage loan portfolio remained resilient and are evolving as expected. \n LTV and debt service coverage ratios remain strong. Less than 1.5% of our loans have an LTV greater than 80% with a debt service coverage ratio below 1x. Our team is now focused on resolving 2024 maturities, of which office maturities are only $240 million or approximately 3% of the office portfolio. Corebridge remains proactive in reserving for potential losses in the portfolio and continues to maintain a robust loan loss allowance, which is reassessed on a quarterly basis. \n As of December 31, our allowance is equal to 1.8% of the total CML book, unchanged from the prior quarter. We also continue to hold an allowance in excess of 5% for our traditional office portfolio. We continue to believe our exposure to the office sector is manageable and remain convinced that the dislocation in this sector will play out over time. \n Now moving to variable investment income. Alternative investments, which represent only 3% of our total invested assets or $5.5 billion, delivered a $23 million loss in the quarter. Positive returns in traditional private equity were offset by losses in real estate equity and hedge funds. During 2023, we reduced our hedge fund holdings by over 70%, ending the year with a portfolio of approximately $200 million. Alternative investments continue to be an important asset class as part of our strategic asset allocation. Over the last 5 years, these investments have returned an average of 14%, and we continue to have a long-term performance expectation of 8% to 9% for the asset class. \n Given the increases in cap rates during the fourth quarter, we are expecting further mark-to-market losses on our real estate equity investments in the first quarter of 2024. Real estate equity constitutes approximately 25% of our alternative investments or less than 1% of our total invested assets. Despite these valuation impacts, the portfolio continues to perform well with strong cash flows at the property level. \n Pivoting to the business segments, which continued their strong performance during the fourth quarter. Individual Retirement reported adjusted pretax operating income of $628 million, a 35% increase year-over-year, primarily driven by higher base spread income resulting from general account product growth and base spread expansion. Over the last 12 months, this business has contributed approximately 60% Corebridge's insurance segment operating results. The compelling value proposition of our fixed and fixed index annuities has been responsible for approximately 51% of our earnings. Variable annuities have contributed only 9% to our adjusted pretax operating income. \n Base net investment spread for Individual Retirement rose 37 basis points from the prior year quarter and 4 basis points sequentially. We expect base spread income will continue to grow over the coming year. However, base net investment spread expansion likely has peaked. That being said, base spreads on the overall portfolio remain at very attractive levels. \n The operational capacity expansion we discussed during last quarter's earnings call allowed us to deliver over $3 billion of fixed annuity sales during the third -- during the last 3 months of the year. This along with persistently strong fixed index annuity sales helped Individual Retirement delivered positive general account net flows of roughly $1.7 billion. Our fourth quarter fixed annuity surrender rate declined 80 basis points sequentially. While we expect surrender rates largely to track changes in interest rates, periodically, we may see movements in the surrender rate as blocks of business exit their surrender charge protection. For instance, in the first quarter of 2024 we expect a higher volume of annuities exiting the surrender charge protection, which should result in an elevated surrender rate. That being said, we continue to project general account net flows will remain positive. \n Group Retirement reported adjusted pretax operating income of $179 million, a 4% increase year-over-year. This includes higher fee income and lower expenses, partially offset by lower base spread income. Over the last 12 months, the business has contributed approximately 20% to Corebridge's insurance segment operating results. Group Retirement is a consistent performer. Excluding variable investment income, it has steadily delivered an average of $179 million (sic) [ $170 million ] of earnings per quarter over the last 16 quarters. Importantly, it is less capital-intensive than our other businesses, with an even split between spread and fee income. \n As with others in the industry and broader demographic trends in the country, our net outflows are typically driven by customers at or near retirement and transitioning from asset accumulation to asset distribution. These older-age cohorts tend to have higher guaranteed minimum interest rates and larger account values. Concurrently, our net inflows are dominated by our younger-age cohorts with lower guaranteed minimum interest rates. Additionally, we're seeing inflows from auto plan fixed and fixed index annuity sales and our broader offering of advisory and brokerage services, which collectively grew in excess of 40% year-over-year.\n Finally, I would remind you that there is seasonality in our net flows resulting from required minimum distributions by plan participants. We typically see raised levels of outflows at the end of the year, which we saw again in the fourth quarter. The impact was approximately $400 million. \n Life Insurance reported adjusted pretax operating income of $79 million, a 44% decrease year-over-year, mainly driven by mortality experience in our universal life book this quarter and $22 million of net favorable nonrecurring items from the fourth quarter of 2022. Our traditional mortality experience, which is primarily comprised of [ term ], was favorable this quarter, and overall mortality experience for the full year, inclusive of reserve impact, was consistent with our expectations.\n As a reminder, our sale of Laya Healthcare closed on October 31. So results from this business were only included in our financials for 1 month of the fourth quarter. As we have demonstrated, we're always looking for ways to optimize our portfolio, both in-force and new business. We will continue to regularly review opportunities to increase shareholder value. \n Institutional Markets reported adjusted pretax operating income of $93 million, a 55% increase year-over-year, primarily driven by higher base spread income. Our reserves have grown $8 billion or 26% year-over-year, with the expansion of our PRT and GIC businesses. Looking forward, we continue to expect meaningful opportunities to further expand both businesses at attractive margins, which should lead to ongoing growth of base spread income and distributable cash flows.\n Corporate & Other reported an adjusted pretax operating loss of $159 million, primarily the result of our stand-alone capital structure and new parent company expenses since the IPO. \n Wrapping up, Corebridge continues to maintain strong capital and liquidity positions. We ended the year with $1.6 billion of holding company liquidity exceeding our next 12-month needs. In the fourth quarter, Corebridge delivered a run rate payout ratio of 60%, excluding special dividends. We returned $1.1 billion to shareholders, comprised of $250 million of share repurchases, approximately $145 million of regular quarterly dividends, and a $730 million special dividend that distributed the proceeds from our sale of Laya Healthcare.\n We estimate our Life Fleet RBC ratio to be in the range of 400% (sic) [ 420% ] to 430% as of the end of the year. This was after distributing $2 billion from our insurance companies, which translates into approximately 50 RBC points. Corebridge is starting 2024 in a strong position with enhanced financial flexibility, and we believe we're on track to deliver on our goals, including a payout ratio of 60% to 65%. Consistent with our approach of creating value and enhancing financial flexibility, we're working to have our Bermuda entity support further business development activities. This will provide Corebridge with an additional capacity to grow while optimizing our capital. We're working through the necessary regulatory approvals, which we expect to complete in 2024. In conclusion, 2023 was a very successful year for Corebridge, with the fourth quarter an excellent capstone. We've made tremendous progress, and we remain focused on delivering on our financial goals in 2024. \n I will now turn the call back to Isil. \nIsil Muderrisoglu: Thanks, Elias. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, we are ready to begin the Q&A portion of our call. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan Krueger from KBW. \nRyan Krueger: My first question was on the Bermuda comment you just made. Just curious, do you view Bermuda as more of an opportunity to improve capital efficiency on new business? Or do you -- in addition to that, do you also see an opportunity to improve the capital efficiency of the existing in-force? \nKevin Hogan: Yes. Thanks, Ryan. As we understand our opportunity, our obligation is to constantly review the portfolio and look for opportunities to create value. And I think we've had a history of execution there, including in Bermuda. We're very familiar with the Bermuda environment. We have a well-capitalized legal entity in Bermuda. And per Elias' comments, we're working now on enhancing its position. We do see various opportunities in Bermuda, obviously, supporting new growth, which is what we're focused on at this point. But it does create opportunities for enhancing capital efficiencies. And we'll continue to review opportunities of an affiliated reinsurer of our own in Bermuda as well as other potential alternative solutions and continue to understand what the market conditions are and where there may be value generation opportunities. \n We don't have anything else to report at this time. But we're focused on enhancing the capabilities of our Bermuda entity. \nRyan Krueger: Got it. And then a follow-up was on interest rate sensitivity. I know you've given overall interest rate sensitivity in the past. I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color on isolating your sensitivity to short-term rates, specifically -- and if you've taken any actions or plan to take any actions to reduce the floating rate sensitivity if rates start to decline. \nElias Habayeb: Ryan, it's Elias. So on the interest rate sensitivity in the past, we have given the sensitivity to a 100 basis point change across the curve, and that was like $165 million in the first 12 months. If you look at the portfolio, the portfolio since then has grown, so that's a little higher, but not that materially different. \n With respect to actions around the portfolio, listen, we -- our investment strategy follows our kind of liability profile. We do have some floating rate liabilities like in Institutional Markets, which are backed with floating rate assets. But on top of it, we're very disciplined from an ALM perspective. And we try to match interest rate duration very tightly. And we will react as that profile changes. We're pretty disciplined on that front. \nOperator: Our next question is from Josh Shanker of Bank of America. \nJoshua Shanker: Obviously, a very big quarter for fixed annuity sales. I wonder if you can talk a little bit about distributor and customer behavior as interest rates have fallen a lot. Have they rotated into other products? Are fixed annuity sales still attractive? And how we should sort of think about the mix given the current interest rate environment? \nKevin Hogan: Fixed annuities and fixed index annuities continue to be very attractive. They were attractive at times when the rate environment was a little bit lower, and the rate environment continues to be very supportive. And I think that the fixed income asset class is something that people have really woken up to as part of the long-term savings plan. Since the turn in interest rates really back in 2022 and the advisers that we work with are continuing to focus on ensuring that people are securing their financial futures relative to those long-term plans. \n And what I would say is that, I mean, we're very proud of our execution in working with our distribution partners to mobilize these very attractive products. And even if rates were to come back a little bit, we still see extremely attractive margins. These are extremely attractive return profiles for our customers. And we feel very confident in our position with the fixed and indexed annuities businesses. \nJoshua Shanker: And I'm not asking specific numbers, but the amount of flows that we saw in 4Q, can we look at it and say that the 2024 outlook looks to be in some sort of a supportive range of the generation you did in the last quarter of '23? \nKevin Hogan: Well, the last quarter of 2023 was a unique quarter, and I think what the future environment is going to be in both terms of sales and surrenders is going to ultimately depend where rates are. As I just mentioned, we continue to see strong demand, and surrenders continue to be within our expectations. If rates were to go up again, we would see increased surrenders again, which also creates new business opportunities. \n As Elias pointed out, we do have some blocks that will be exiting their surrender protection period, and we would expect that surrenders would increase a little bit as we do in the first quarter, but we still expect for the general accounts to continue to grow. \nOperator: Our next question is from Joel Hurwitz from Dowling & Partners. \nJoel Hurwitz: So a very strong year for new business generation for you guys, particularly Individual Retirement and Institutional Markets. I guess, can you help size the amount of capital deployed for -- deployed in '23 for organic growth and how that might have compared to prior year? \nElias Habayeb: Joel, it's Elias. We have not given any quantification, but here's what I'll tell you. We're very disciplined with how we manage the balance sheet. And we're very proactive with how we manage the balance sheet. During 2023, we grew our RBC from 411% at the beginning of the year and where we're ending between 420% and 430%. At the same time, the insurance company has distributed about $2 billion of dividends, and that was about 50 RBC points, and we had a record sales period, and we were able to kind of deliver through that. And my expectation is the discipline we've demonstrated from a capital perspective is that's kind of core to us, and we're going to continue that going forward. \nJoel Hurwitz: Okay. I guess just sticking on that, so $2 billion again in distributions from the insurance subs. I guess how do you see that growing, right? Your earnings have grown quite significantly, particularly this year and should be pretty solid moving forward. How do you see that $2 billion growing in and supporting your payout ratio over the medium term? \nElias Habayeb: Well, we do see -- given the growth in earnings and the strength of the balance sheet, we expect the dividends from the insurance companies over time to grow in line to fund us at the 60% to 65% payout ratio. And if you look at the track record of our insurance companies, they've distributed over $2 billion a year. And we've got strong parent liquidity and a strong balance sheet. So sitting here today as the CFO, I feel confident in our ability to deliver on the 60% to 65%. \nOperator: Our next question is from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. \nJamminder Bhullar: So first, just a question on spreads in the Group Retirement business. So they've expanded this year versus last year, and I'm talking about the base spread. But if we look sequentially, they're down each of the last 2 quarters. So clearly, they're at very attractive levels. But assuming interest rates stay where they are right now, would you expect further improvement in spreads? Or are they to a point where any future benefits on yields are going to be offset by just competitive conditions and you having to raise crediting rates as well as we've seen in the last couple of quarters? \nKevin Hogan: There's a number of dynamics in Group Retirement that, I think, have reflected with respect to that trend that you observed there. And part of it is that the age of the -- let's first talk about the implant part of the business, right? I mean there's customers, as Elias pointed out to, that are at that retirement age that are moving from accumulation to decumulation. And sometimes those customers, as you would expect, have larger account values but also higher guaranteed minimum interest rates. And these are the areas where we're seeing the net outflows. It's in the younger customers that are earlier in their savings periods that we're actually seeing offsetting positive inflows, and of course, those come along with lower guaranteed minimum interest rates. \n And so the effect that you're seeing there with a little bit of spread compression is in part an outcome of this dynamic between the older and the younger customers. But the other part of the Group Retirement business that I would -- I'd point to is the out-of-plan business. This is where we have the fixed annuities, indexed annuities as well as the advisory and brokerage platform, which actually has $42 billion in assets under management today and is growing. And the total assets under management in the Group Retirement business are also growing. It reached $122 billion today. And as Elias pointed out, the earnings have been consistent in that business for the last number of years. \n And there's a strong balance between spread income and fee income in Group Retirement. So the spread income is one dynamic, but the growth in the fee income base is another dynamic, and we see upside opportunities across this business. \nElias Habayeb: And if I can add, Jimmy, if you look at the numbers, while base spread income came down, fee income went up 7% year-over-year. And then the advisory and brokerage net flows are not included in our net flows. So if you adjust that, actually, the net outflows would be less. \nJamminder Bhullar: Yes, yes. And then maybe one on individual life. If we look at your margins over the course of this year, they've fluctuated, like last quarter was better than normal, this quarter seemed like it was worse than normal. Is that just sort of aberration and normal volatility? And do you view this -- the year as a whole, 2024 as a whole -- or '23 as a whole sort of a good level to use for margins in individual life going forward? \nKevin Hogan: In the universal life, it still has sort of the volatility effect. I mean LDTI did not necessarily change the reporting basis for the UL business. And in mortality, there is expected volatility. As you pointed out, the fourth quarter was a little bit high for us, but the previous couple of quarters were actually well within expectations. And as we look at the full year, just within UL, that remained within our expectations and across the entire mortality portfolio was within our expectations. \n And so we do view it as a full year level, and we haven't seen anything in the data that suggests any change to our long-term assumptions. \nOperator: Our next question is from Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. \nThomas Gallagher: Just a follow-up on Ryan's question. Given that you're going to be setting up the Bermuda captive, are you more likely to consider internal reinsurance as your primary option to optimize capital? Or are you also strongly considering external potential risk transfer as well? \nKevin Hogan: We consider all options. We understand that, that is our opportunity as well as our obligation as management to look for opportunities to optimize the portfolio and create shareholder value. As I mentioned earlier, we have a Bermuda entity, and it is capitalized. We are working on essentially expanding its license to be able to support part of our new business. But there are other opportunities that we have relative to the Bermuda entity over time. \n But in addition to that, we are currently aware of market conditions with external parties relative to potential transactions and evaluating those opportunities. And we will continue to do so. And as I pointed out earlier, we have nothing to report at this time. \nThomas Gallagher: Great. That's helpful color, Kevin. The -- my follow-up is just on the investment side. So one observation and question is, I noticed your commercial mortgage loan reserves for office actually declined from 3Q. I think it was 5.9% last quarter, down to 5.2% this quarter. Just curious what drove that. Was that from maturities or from closures? \n And then a broader question on multifamily. I know that's your biggest exposure on the commercial mortgage loan side, there's been some new market concerns in that asset class. Just if you could give a little perspective on how you're feeling about multifamily. \nElias Habayeb: Tom, it's Elias. We have no foreclosures in the book. So the reduction in our allowance for offices more having to do with resolution loans, but there's no foreclosures in our portfolio. And we continue to believe our allowance for loan loss in total and specifically on office continues to be pretty robust from there.\n With respect to multifamily, yes, it is our largest exposure, and we participate in it both on the debt and the equity side, and we feel comfortable with our portfolio. It's high-quality. Cash flow to the property levels are strong. LTVs, debt service coverage ratios are strong. With respect to kind of concerns about rent control specifically in New York, our exposure to rent control is de minimis in our portfolio. So that's not something we're worried about. \nOperator: Next question is from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. \nElyse Greenspan: My first question, just on capital return. You guys started right buying back shares in the open market. How should we think about, in '24, the balance of buying back shares in the open market and then wanting to participate as there is future secondaries from AIG? \nElias Habayeb: Elyse, it's Elias. Listen, I think our outlook is we're going to buy back shares in open market. And if there's opportunities to participate in AIG sell-downs, we will consider it and do it. But our game plan, we're not dependent on AIG to do a secondary for us to deliver on our capital return. \nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then my second question, we saw PRT activity picked up in the fourth quarter. My sense is we're not seeing as much of the same seasonality with Q4 being the highest as we used to in the past. If you can you just give us a sense of the outlook that you have on the PRT side? And if you expect or don't expect to see seasonality with transactions in '24? \nKevin Hogan: Yes. Thanks, Elyse. What we see in pension risk transfer is a very strong pipeline continuing for the market segments that we're focused on, which is full plan terminations. Full plan terminations are somewhat more structured and complex than some of the longevity-focused transactions. And the pipeline for those is a little bit longer term. I think there has been a bit of a change in calendarization with the change in the external market. But both for the U.S. and for the U.K., which are the 2 markets where we participate, we see a very robust pipeline coming into 2024. \nOperator: Our next question is from John Barnidge at Piper Sandler. \nJohn Barnidge: With the expense saves fully earning in by the end of '24 and a focus on continuous improvement, how should we be thinking about the operating expense growth as you would think -- as you would look towards '25? \nKevin Hogan: Yes, thanks. So we are very happy with the progress on Corebridge Forward so far. We've achieved about $350 million of the target there, and we expect about half of that to earn into our run rate this year. And we still have the continuing outcomes from Corebridge Forward to deliver. As we look beyond and adoption of a sense of continuous improvement, I think this is where we'll benefit from the investments that we've made in our operating platform, and we'll continue to respond to growth opportunities as they emerge. And so we would expect an incremental improvement in operational efficiency as we benefit from the work that we've done so far and continue to focus from that. \nJohn Barnidge: And then a question on the higher frequency and smaller claims in the life portfolio. Some have talked about infectious disease season being earlier this year, more 4Q than 1Q. Does that experience line up with that thought process as well? \nKevin Hogan: Actually, in our case, we haven't observed this particular dynamic. And as I pointed out earlier, as we look into the data, we haven't seen anything to suggest other than just an anomalous quarter. And mortality, while in many respects, is very predictable, the actual timing of mortality is not so predictable. And that's why we do continue to expect them to see some volatility quarter-to-quarter, and we need to look at mortality over a longer time frame. \nOperator: Our next question is from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies. \nSuneet Kamath: Listening to your prepared remarks, I had thought that the commentary that you made about optimization of the business mix was in your discussion on the Life Insurance business. So is that really where we should think about your focus being? Or is it broader than that? \nKevin Hogan: With respect to the Life Insurance business, we have changed our business mix in the last couple of years. We've been kind of open talking about that and moving away from more interest-sensitive products into our very successful term suite as well as simplified products for the middle market and our indexed universal life product range. And those are the segments that we continue to focus on and anticipate its advantage. \nElias Habayeb: Yes. Suneet, the other thing I had, given our broad suite of products, we're constantly optimizing given where we see demand for product as well as where we think we can get the best risk-adjusted returns on the capital we deploy. So that's a regular activity. \nSuneet Kamath: Okay. Got it. And then I guess just going back to the annuity sales, obviously, very strong here in the quarter. Can you just provide some color on maybe where those sales are coming from, if it's a particular channel and maybe how much of that is coming from rollovers of 401(k) plans or assets? \nKevin Hogan: So the channels that are the most robust for us right now with respect to fixed and fixed-index annuities are the bank and the broker-dealer channels with a lesser participation in the IMO channel. And in terms of the sources of the assets, we don't report on what the various sources of the asset is. What I'll say is that as we've experienced and as we would expect, customers coming out of existing annuities products certainly have the opportunity to reinvest. And as people move from accumulation to decumulation, fixed income is an important part of the strategy of many of the advisers that they are working with. And so I think what we're seeing is a combination of new investments in fixed income because the value proposition for fixed income investments is much stronger now than just a couple of years ago as well as some regular activity of people reinvesting in their existing annuity products. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Ward at Citi. \nMichael Ward: Maybe on the Bermuda entity real quick. I was just wondering if you could maybe help us think about any potential impact on free cash flow conversion from higher utilization of that over time? \nElias Habayeb: Mike, it's Elias. So here's what I'd say about the Bermuda entity at this point. We believe it will increase our financial flexibility that either gives us flexibility for more growth or to do other things with it. We're still through the regulatory process. So we're not going to quantify anything at this point. So we're done through that process at this stage. \nMichael Ward: Okay. And then maybe on CRE, just kind of curious, the maturities that you've had so far or the ones that are in the sort of the immediate future, just kind of wondering how the resolutions have progressed. Are you taking equity? Are you making equity investments at all? Or how have they gone so far? \nElias Habayeb: So on -- if I look at the '23 maturities, it's been a combination where we got paid off or we've agreed to an extension. And generally, whenever we've agreed an extension, we either got a partial pay down or we had the equity put in more -- the equity investor put in more equity in the property and draft cash, which ended up improving our credit position in there. We have not taken so far any equity in any of these properties. \nOperator: We have no further questions on the call at this time. So I will hand the call back to Kevin Hogan. \nKevin Hogan: Before we end today's call, I want to make one more point to our listeners and remind everyone the enterprise we're building here. \n At Corebridge, we operate with what is a unique collection of 4 businesses that together enables our company to perform across different macroeconomic environments. We're flexible and nimble and can tailor our strategy to match changes in demand as well as our evolving view of profitability and risk. With this diversified and dynamic business model, supported by our strong balance sheet, our solid capital and liquidity positions and our history of disciplined execution, Corebridge remains focused on delivering attractive results and creating long-term value.\n Thank you for joining us this morning, and have a good day. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all very much for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. Corebridge delivered excellent results, both in the fourth quarter as well as the full year of 2023 while improving our financial position. We executed across strategic and operational priorities and made significant progress on the financial goals we established at the time of the IPO. Corebridge increased profitability by capitalizing on market opportunities while reducing our operating expenses. We strengthened our core businesses and enhanced our financial flexibility while returning significant capital to shareholders.\n Corebridge reported fourth quarter adjusted pretax operating income of $820 million or earnings per share of $1.04, an increase of 12% year-over-year on a per share basis. Operating EPS included a $0.06 impact from nonrecurring items in our investment portfolio related to a prior period true-up on certain investments. This was offset by a $0.17 impact from alternative investment returns below our long-term expectations. Adjusting for these 2 items, our operating EPS would have been $1.15. This is a 25% improvement year-over-year on a comparative basis.\n Our aggregate core sources of income, which excludes variable investment income, improved year-over-year driven by growth in base spread income and in fee income, partially offset by a reduction in underwriting margin. The increase in base spread income, our largest source of earnings, was driven by higher new money yields and growth of our broad portfolio of spread-based products. On average, new money yields were 7% in the fourth quarter or 190 basis points above yields on assets that matured or were sold in our general accounts. Total invested assets grew by approximately $11 billion.\n The increase in fee income, our second largest source of earnings, reflected the improvements in underlying asset valuations and the expansion of advisory and brokerage services in our Group Retirement segment. The decline in underwriting margin was the result of a higher frequency of smaller claims in our universal life book this quarter and net favorable nonrecurring items impacting our Life Insurance segment in the prior year quarter. \n Pivoting to net investment income. Net investment income for our insurance companies on an APTOI basis improved 16% year-over-year. Base portfolio income grew 17% over the prior year quarter to nearly $2.6 billion. Reported base yields increased 45 basis points year-over-year to 4.87%. Excluding the impact from the aforementioned nonrecurring items, base yields increased 51 basis points over the prior year quarter. \n Based on our current interest rate and net flows outlook for 2024, we expect base portfolio income, along with associated base yield, will continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace. Corebridge improved base yield this quarter while also moving up in credit quality. Our general account investment portfolio is well positioned to perform under various market conditions. It is diversified, actively managed and remains high quality, with an average credit rating of A flat. 95% of fixed maturities were rated in investment grade as of December 31. The credit metrics in our Corebridge fixed income portfolio remained strong, and for the full year, the portfolio experienced net positive rating migrations, with upgrades outpacing downgrades. The credit fundamentals in our commercial mortgage loan portfolio remained resilient and are evolving as expected. \n LTV and debt service coverage ratios remain strong. Less than 1.5% of our loans have an LTV greater than 80% with a debt service coverage ratio below 1x. Our team is now focused on resolving 2024 maturities, of which office maturities are only $240 million or approximately 3% of the office portfolio. Corebridge remains proactive in reserving for potential losses in the portfolio and continues to maintain a robust loan loss allowance, which is reassessed on a quarterly basis. \n As of December 31, our allowance is equal to 1.8% of the total CML book, unchanged from the prior quarter. We also continue to hold an allowance in excess of 5% for our traditional office portfolio. We continue to believe our exposure to the office sector is manageable and remain convinced that the dislocation in this sector will play out over time. \n Now moving to variable investment income. Alternative investments, which represent only 3% of our total invested assets or $5.5 billion, delivered a $23 million loss in the quarter. Positive returns in traditional private equity were offset by losses in real estate equity and hedge funds. During 2023, we reduced our hedge fund holdings by over 70%, ending the year with a portfolio of approximately $200 million. Alternative investments continue to be an important asset class as part of our strategic asset allocation. Over the last 5 years, these investments have returned an average of 14%, and we continue to have a long-term performance expectation of 8% to 9% for the asset class. \n Given the increases in cap rates during the fourth quarter, we are expecting further mark-to-market losses on our real estate equity investments in the first quarter of 2024. Real estate equity constitutes approximately 25% of our alternative investments or less than 1% of our total invested assets. Despite these valuation impacts, the portfolio continues to perform well with strong cash flows at the property level. \n Pivoting to the business segments, which continued their strong performance during the fourth quarter. Individual Retirement reported adjusted pretax operating income of $628 million, a 35% increase year-over-year, primarily driven by higher base spread income resulting from general account product growth and base spread expansion. Over the last 12 months, this business has contributed approximately 60% Corebridge's insurance segment operating results. The compelling value proposition of our fixed and fixed index annuities has been responsible for approximately 51% of our earnings. Variable annuities have contributed only 9% to our adjusted pretax operating income. \n Base net investment spread for Individual Retirement rose 37 basis points from the prior year quarter and 4 basis points sequentially. We expect base spread income will continue to grow over the coming year. However, base net investment spread expansion likely has peaked. That being said, base spreads on the overall portfolio remain at very attractive levels. \n The operational capacity expansion we discussed during last quarter's earnings call allowed us to deliver over $3 billion of fixed annuity sales during the third -- during the last 3 months of the year. This along with persistently strong fixed index annuity sales helped Individual Retirement delivered positive general account net flows of roughly $1.7 billion. Our fourth quarter fixed annuity surrender rate declined 80 basis points sequentially. While we expect surrender rates largely to track changes in interest rates, periodically, we may see movements in the surrender rate as blocks of business exit their surrender charge protection. For instance, in the first quarter of 2024 we expect a higher volume of annuities exiting the surrender charge protection, which should result in an elevated surrender rate. That being said, we continue to project general account net flows will remain positive. \n Group Retirement reported adjusted pretax operating income of $179 million, a 4% increase year-over-year. This includes higher fee income and lower expenses, partially offset by lower base spread income. Over the last 12 months, the business has contributed approximately 20% to Corebridge's insurance segment operating results. Group Retirement is a consistent performer. Excluding variable investment income, it has steadily delivered an average of $179 million (sic) [ $170 million ] of earnings per quarter over the last 16 quarters. Importantly, it is less capital-intensive than our other businesses, with an even split between spread and fee income. \n As with others in the industry and broader demographic trends in the country, our net outflows are typically driven by customers at or near retirement and transitioning from asset accumulation to asset distribution. These older-age cohorts tend to have higher guaranteed minimum interest rates and larger account values. Concurrently, our net inflows are dominated by our younger-age cohorts with lower guaranteed minimum interest rates. Additionally, we're seeing inflows from auto plan fixed and fixed index annuity sales and our broader offering of advisory and brokerage services, which collectively grew in excess of 40% year-over-year.\n Finally, I would remind you that there is seasonality in our net flows resulting from required minimum distributions by plan participants. We typically see raised levels of outflows at the end of the year, which we saw again in the fourth quarter. The impact was approximately $400 million. \n Life Insurance reported adjusted pretax operating income of $79 million, a 44% decrease year-over-year, mainly driven by mortality experience in our universal life book this quarter and $22 million of net favorable nonrecurring items from the fourth quarter of 2022. Our traditional mortality experience, which is primarily comprised of [ term ], was favorable this quarter, and overall mortality experience for the full year, inclusive of reserve impact, was consistent with our expectations.\n As a reminder, our sale of Laya Healthcare closed on October 31. So results from this business were only included in our financials for 1 month of the fourth quarter. As we have demonstrated, we're always looking for ways to optimize our portfolio, both in-force and new business. We will continue to regularly review opportunities to increase shareholder value. \n Institutional Markets reported adjusted pretax operating income of $93 million, a 55% increase year-over-year, primarily driven by higher base spread income. Our reserves have grown $8 billion or 26% year-over-year, with the expansion of our PRT and GIC businesses. Looking forward, we continue to expect meaningful opportunities to further expand both businesses at attractive margins, which should lead to ongoing growth of base spread income and distributable cash flows.\n Corporate & Other reported an adjusted pretax operating loss of $159 million, primarily the result of our stand-alone capital structure and new parent company expenses since the IPO. \n Wrapping up, Corebridge continues to maintain strong capital and liquidity positions. We ended the year with $1.6 billion of holding company liquidity exceeding our next 12-month needs. In the fourth quarter, Corebridge delivered a run rate payout ratio of 60%, excluding special dividends. We returned $1.1 billion to shareholders, comprised of $250 million of share repurchases, approximately $145 million of regular quarterly dividends, and a $730 million special dividend that distributed the proceeds from our sale of Laya Healthcare.\n We estimate our Life Fleet RBC ratio to be in the range of 400% (sic) [ 420% ] to 430% as of the end of the year. This was after distributing $2 billion from our insurance companies, which translates into approximately 50 RBC points. Corebridge is starting 2024 in a strong position with enhanced financial flexibility, and we believe we're on track to deliver on our goals, including a payout ratio of 60% to 65%. Consistent with our approach of creating value and enhancing financial flexibility, we're working to have our Bermuda entity support further business development activities. This will provide Corebridge with an additional capacity to grow while optimizing our capital. We're working through the necessary regulatory approvals, which we expect to complete in 2024. In conclusion, 2023 was a very successful year for Corebridge, with the fourth quarter an excellent capstone. We've made tremendous progress, and we remain focused on delivering on our financial goals in 2024. \n I will now turn the call back to Isil. Ryan, it's Elias. So on the interest rate sensitivity in the past, we have given the sensitivity to a 100 basis point change across the curve, and that was like $165 million in the first 12 months. If you look at the portfolio, the portfolio since then has grown, so that's a little higher, but not that materially different. \n With respect to actions around the portfolio, listen, we -- our investment strategy follows our kind of liability profile. We do have some floating rate liabilities like in Institutional Markets, which are backed with floating rate assets. But on top of it, we're very disciplined from an ALM perspective. And we try to match interest rate duration very tightly. And we will react as that profile changes. We're pretty disciplined on that front. Joel, it's Elias. We have not given any quantification, but here's what I'll tell you. We're very disciplined with how we manage the balance sheet. And we're very proactive with how we manage the balance sheet. During 2023, we grew our RBC from 411% at the beginning of the year and where we're ending between 420% and 430%. At the same time, the insurance company has distributed about $2 billion of dividends, and that was about 50 RBC points, and we had a record sales period, and we were able to kind of deliver through that. And my expectation is the discipline we've demonstrated from a capital perspective is that's kind of core to us, and we're going to continue that going forward. Well, we do see -- given the growth in earnings and the strength of the balance sheet, we expect the dividends from the insurance companies over time to grow in line to fund us at the 60% to 65% payout ratio. And if you look at the track record of our insurance companies, they've distributed over $2 billion a year. And we've got strong parent liquidity and a strong balance sheet. So sitting here today as the CFO, I feel confident in our ability to deliver on the 60% to 65%. And if I can add, Jimmy, if you look at the numbers, while base spread income came down, fee income went up 7% year-over-year. And then the advisory and brokerage net flows are not included in our net flows. So if you adjust that, actually, the net outflows would be less. Tom, it's Elias. We have no foreclosures in the book. So the reduction in our allowance for offices more having to do with resolution loans, but there's no foreclosures in our portfolio. And we continue to believe our allowance for loan loss in total and specifically on office continues to be pretty robust from there.\n With respect to multifamily, yes, it is our largest exposure, and we participate in it both on the debt and the equity side, and we feel comfortable with our portfolio. It's high-quality. Cash flow to the property levels are strong. LTVs, debt service coverage ratios are strong. With respect to kind of concerns about rent control specifically in New York, our exposure to rent control is de minimis in our portfolio. So that's not something we're worried about. Elyse, it's Elias. Listen, I think our outlook is we're going to buy back shares in open market. And if there's opportunities to participate in AIG sell-downs, we will consider it and do it. But our game plan, we're not dependent on AIG to do a secondary for us to deliver on our capital return. Yes. Suneet, the other thing I had, given our broad suite of products, we're constantly optimizing given where we see demand for product as well as where we think we can get the best risk-adjusted returns on the capital we deploy. So that's a regular activity. Mike, it's Elias. So here's what I'd say about the Bermuda entity at this point. We believe it will increase our financial flexibility that either gives us flexibility for more growth or to do other things with it. We're still through the regulatory process. So we're not going to quantify anything at this point. So we're done through that process at this stage. So on -- if I look at the '23 maturities, it's been a combination where we got paid off or we've agreed to an extension. And generally, whenever we've agreed an extension, we either got a partial pay down or we had the equity put in more -- the equity investor put in more equity in the property and draft cash, which ended up improving our credit position in there. We have not taken so far any equity in any of these properties."

            "name": "Kevin Hogan",
            "content": "Thank you, Isil, and good morning. 2023 was built an important year for Corebridge and a successful one. We executed with focus and determination, capitalized on attractive market opportunities, made tremendous progress on our strategic and operational priorities. And in each and every quarter, we delivered quality financial results. This morning, I will review the first full calendar year for Corebridge through 5 different lenses: profitability, sales, sources of income, operating expenses and capital return. Elias will then provide details on our fourth quarter results and offer some guidance for the year ahead. \n But first, I want to remind you of the value proposition we laid out at our IPO. Corebridge operates 4 market-leading businesses that provide a broad set of protection and retirement solutions to individuals and institutions. We manufacture a wide range of products that appeal to different market segments while also designed to generate attractive returns. We have a high-quality in-force portfolio and have managed it carefully. The diversity in our product suite and the breadth of our distribution strategy allow us to be nimble and react to evolving market conditions. We have the ability to dial up and dial down product sales based on changes in customer demand and where risk-adjusted returns are the most attractive, as evidenced by our recent emphasis on spread-based products, such as fixed annuities, which has grown over 200% since 2020 and, pension risk transfer, which has grown 130% over the same period. \n Our leading distribution platform is also a significant contributor to our agility, with over 1,200 distribution relationships with banks, broker-dealers, wirehouses, independent marketing organizations and general and independent agencies as well as our own financial adviser and our direct channel. We continue to invest in our platforms to improve efficiency, scalability and productivity such as we have been undertaking with Corebridge Forward our modernization program. \n Our competitiveness is further supported by our asset origination capabilities that have been enhanced by our investment partnerships with Blackstone and BlackRock. Our strategy is to grow our company in a way that creates value for both our customers and our shareholders. Collectively, our diversified businesses and dynamic business model have a long track record of delivering attractive financial results and consistent cash flows under different macro environments. Together with our strong balance sheet, we are well positioned to deliver long-term value to our shareholders by remaining focused on improving profitability and returning a meaningful amount of capital. With that as background, I would like to review our 2023 financial results.\n Corebridge is pleased to report very strong results not only for the fourth quarter but also for the full year. We grew 2023 adjusted after-tax operating income to $2.6 billion, a 12% increase year-over-year. Our full year non-GAAP operating earnings per share also rose by 12% to $4.10, and our 2023 adjusted return on average equity increased on a run rate basis to 12.2%, an improvement of over 200 basis points from the prior year. Corebridge drove profitability through strong top line growth, margin expansion and expense efficiency. We benefited from the investments we have made in our operating model, which positioned us to capitalize on historic market opportunities. \n In 2023, we grew premiums and deposits across our broad portfolio of spread-based products by 60%. These products are particularly attractive now, producing strong margins with double-digit IRRs. Looking across the entire Corebridge portfolio, premiums and deposits were $10.5 billion for the fourth quarter and $39.9 billion for the year. The full year volume of almost $40 billion is a new record for us and one of several high watermarks for 2023, including fixed annuities, fixed index annuities, guaranteed investment contracts and pension risk transfer sales. \n Complementing this growth, we leveraged our unique investment platform to scale the origination of attractive assets that are well matched to our liabilities and to opportunistically lock in favorable yields from which we expect to see benefits for years to come. Our new operating model enabled us to rapidly expand capacity to support record sales volumes, especially in the latter part of the year. We also grew our aggregate core sources of income, which increased 12% for the full year to $7.1 billion. Our 4 established businesses generate an attractive mix of spread income, fee income and underwriting margin. We enjoyed meaningful growth of spread income supported by market conditions, while at the same time, fee income stabilized with improved asset valuations and the expansion of our advisory and brokerage business and Group Retirement. And we continue to generate a solid underwriting margin from improved full year mortality experience.\n Taking a look at our spread businesses, we increased full year base spread income by nearly $900 million or 30% to $3.7 billion. We were able to serve our customers and distribution partners' needs with attractive products reflecting some of the most supportive market conditions in recent memory. With interest rates at levels not seen in over a decade, we seized the opportunity. As we look ahead to 2024, the environment remains attractive for new business, and we remain well positioned to serve our markets. \n Although we invested as appropriate to increase our capacity in both sales and operations to support this unique growth opportunity, we also remain steadfastly focused on expenses. Between the fourth quarter of 2022 and the fourth quarter of 2023, we reduced our operating expenses by 14%. A key contributor has been Corebridge Forward. We have achieved or contracted on 88% of our exit run rate savings goal of $400 million, and we expect the vast majority to earn into our results by the end of 2024. This program is near its completion as we transition to a focus on continuous improvement. \n Turning to capital management. We have been clear since the outside of Corebridge that we are committed to deploying capital to create value for shareholders. In 2023, we demonstrated our ability to do this, with strong cash flows from our insurance companies, supported by important strategic transactions. We closed the sale of Laya Healthcare in Ireland and remain on track to close the sale of our U.K. life business in the second quarter of 2024 as we streamline our portfolio with a continuing focus on life and retirement solutions in the United States. Collectively, the sale of our international life operations will generate over $1 billion of value. \n Corebridge returned over $2.2 billion to shareholders in our first full calendar year as a public company, including special dividends, and we remain committed to delivering a 60% to 65% payout ratio in 2024. Our delivery of these attractive levels of shareholder return reflects the confidence we have in our financial position. We entered 2024 with a strong balance sheet and ample levels of liquidity and capital, representing enhanced financial flexibility. For over a decade and across various economic cycles, we have consistently maintained a Life Fleet RBC ratio above our target. At the same time, our insurance companies have distributed over $2 billion annually to our holding company. We are routinely able to maintain healthy capital levels regardless of the macro environment while simultaneously supporting new business volume and robust capital return. \n Finally, I want to turn to the operational separation from AIG. This has been a complex program demanding considerable expertise and coordination, and we are nearing the end of our work. We established the capabilities required of a stand-alone public company, implemented our own capital structure, created and brought to life a new brand and disentangled functions, systems and infrastructure. \n On the IT side, just as one example, we migrated nearly 700 physical applications, hundreds of operating platforms and thousands of end users. These efforts did not distract us from continuing to serve our customers and distribution partners. At the end of 2023, our total spend on operational separation was $425 million. As we said before, some work has indeed extended into 2024, along with a handful of transition services agreements. All of this required an extraordinary effort. For our employees, you have my gratitude. We ask a lot of all of you, and you delivered. I also want to thank our partners and AIG for helping to make our operational separation of success. \n Returning to where I began my remarks, 2023 was our first full calendar year as a public company, and it was a very productive one. The fourth quarter was a strong conclusion to what was a very good year. \n I will now turn the call over to Elias who will go into more detail on the results for the quarter. Yes. Thanks, Ryan. As we understand our opportunity, our obligation is to constantly review the portfolio and look for opportunities to create value. And I think we've had a history of execution there, including in Bermuda. We're very familiar with the Bermuda environment. We have a well-capitalized legal entity in Bermuda. And per Elias' comments, we're working now on enhancing its position. We do see various opportunities in Bermuda, obviously, supporting new growth, which is what we're focused on at this point. But it does create opportunities for enhancing capital efficiencies. And we'll continue to review opportunities of an affiliated reinsurer of our own in Bermuda as well as other potential alternative solutions and continue to understand what the market conditions are and where there may be value generation opportunities. \n We don't have anything else to report at this time. But we're focused on enhancing the capabilities of our Bermuda entity. Fixed annuities and fixed index annuities continue to be very attractive. They were attractive at times when the rate environment was a little bit lower, and the rate environment continues to be very supportive. And I think that the fixed income asset class is something that people have really woken up to as part of the long-term savings plan. Since the turn in interest rates really back in 2022 and the advisers that we work with are continuing to focus on ensuring that people are securing their financial futures relative to those long-term plans. \n And what I would say is that, I mean, we're very proud of our execution in working with our distribution partners to mobilize these very attractive products. And even if rates were to come back a little bit, we still see extremely attractive margins. These are extremely attractive return profiles for our customers. And we feel very confident in our position with the fixed and indexed annuities businesses. Well, the last quarter of 2023 was a unique quarter, and I think what the future environment is going to be in both terms of sales and surrenders is going to ultimately depend where rates are. As I just mentioned, we continue to see strong demand, and surrenders continue to be within our expectations. If rates were to go up again, we would see increased surrenders again, which also creates new business opportunities. \n As Elias pointed out, we do have some blocks that will be exiting their surrender protection period, and we would expect that surrenders would increase a little bit as we do in the first quarter, but we still expect for the general accounts to continue to grow. There's a number of dynamics in Group Retirement that, I think, have reflected with respect to that trend that you observed there. And part of it is that the age of the -- let's first talk about the implant part of the business, right? I mean there's customers, as Elias pointed out to, that are at that retirement age that are moving from accumulation to decumulation. And sometimes those customers, as you would expect, have larger account values but also higher guaranteed minimum interest rates. And these are the areas where we're seeing the net outflows. It's in the younger customers that are earlier in their savings periods that we're actually seeing offsetting positive inflows, and of course, those come along with lower guaranteed minimum interest rates. \n And so the effect that you're seeing there with a little bit of spread compression is in part an outcome of this dynamic between the older and the younger customers. But the other part of the Group Retirement business that I would -- I'd point to is the out-of-plan business. This is where we have the fixed annuities, indexed annuities as well as the advisory and brokerage platform, which actually has $42 billion in assets under management today and is growing. And the total assets under management in the Group Retirement business are also growing. It reached $122 billion today. And as Elias pointed out, the earnings have been consistent in that business for the last number of years. \n And there's a strong balance between spread income and fee income in Group Retirement. So the spread income is one dynamic, but the growth in the fee income base is another dynamic, and we see upside opportunities across this business. In the universal life, it still has sort of the volatility effect. I mean LDTI did not necessarily change the reporting basis for the UL business. And in mortality, there is expected volatility. As you pointed out, the fourth quarter was a little bit high for us, but the previous couple of quarters were actually well within expectations. And as we look at the full year, just within UL, that remained within our expectations and across the entire mortality portfolio was within our expectations. \n And so we do view it as a full year level, and we haven't seen anything in the data that suggests any change to our long-term assumptions. We consider all options. We understand that, that is our opportunity as well as our obligation as management to look for opportunities to optimize the portfolio and create shareholder value. As I mentioned earlier, we have a Bermuda entity, and it is capitalized. We are working on essentially expanding its license to be able to support part of our new business. But there are other opportunities that we have relative to the Bermuda entity over time. \n But in addition to that, we are currently aware of market conditions with external parties relative to potential transactions and evaluating those opportunities. And we will continue to do so. And as I pointed out earlier, we have nothing to report at this time. Yes. Thanks, Elyse. What we see in pension risk transfer is a very strong pipeline continuing for the market segments that we're focused on, which is full plan terminations. Full plan terminations are somewhat more structured and complex than some of the longevity-focused transactions. And the pipeline for those is a little bit longer term. I think there has been a bit of a change in calendarization with the change in the external market. But both for the U.S. and for the U.K., which are the 2 markets where we participate, we see a very robust pipeline coming into 2024. Yes, thanks. So we are very happy with the progress on Corebridge Forward so far. We've achieved about $350 million of the target there, and we expect about half of that to earn into our run rate this year. And we still have the continuing outcomes from Corebridge Forward to deliver. As we look beyond and adoption of a sense of continuous improvement, I think this is where we'll benefit from the investments that we've made in our operating platform, and we'll continue to respond to growth opportunities as they emerge. And so we would expect an incremental improvement in operational efficiency as we benefit from the work that we've done so far and continue to focus from that. Actually, in our case, we haven't observed this particular dynamic. And as I pointed out earlier, as we look into the data, we haven't seen anything to suggest other than just an anomalous quarter. And mortality, while in many respects, is very predictable, the actual timing of mortality is not so predictable. And that's why we do continue to expect them to see some volatility quarter-to-quarter, and we need to look at mortality over a longer time frame. With respect to the Life Insurance business, we have changed our business mix in the last couple of years. We've been kind of open talking about that and moving away from more interest-sensitive products into our very successful term suite as well as simplified products for the middle market and our indexed universal life product range. And those are the segments that we continue to focus on and anticipate its advantage. So the channels that are the most robust for us right now with respect to fixed and fixed-index annuities are the bank and the broker-dealer channels with a lesser participation in the IMO channel. And in terms of the sources of the assets, we don't report on what the various sources of the asset is. What I'll say is that as we've experienced and as we would expect, customers coming out of existing annuities products certainly have the opportunity to reinvest. And as people move from accumulation to decumulation, fixed income is an important part of the strategy of many of the advisers that they are working with. And so I think what we're seeing is a combination of new investments in fixed income because the value proposition for fixed income investments is much stronger now than just a couple of years ago as well as some regular activity of people reinvesting in their existing annuity products. Before we end today's call, I want to make one more point to our listeners and remind everyone the enterprise we're building here. \n At Corebridge, we operate with what is a unique collection of 4 businesses that together enables our company to perform across different macroeconomic environments. We're flexible and nimble and can tailor our strategy to match changes in demand as well as our evolving view of profitability and risk. With this diversified and dynamic business model, supported by our strong balance sheet, our solid capital and liquidity positions and our history of disciplined execution, Corebridge remains focused on delivering attractive results and creating long-term value.\n Thank you for joining us this morning, and have a good day."

This morning, we present our third quarter 2023 results. We delivered another strong quarter and executed with focus and precision across our strategic and operational priorities. Before reviewing our performance for the last three months, I want to share with you the outstanding progress we have made over the last year. On September 15, 2022, Corebridge had its initial public offering and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Since then, our first year as a public company has been a very successful one. Allow me a moment to offer my gratitude to everyone involved. Thank you to our many partners across the industry. Thank you to our customers and clients. And, of course, thank you to our employees. I\u2019m so very proud of our people for their dedication to our company and customers and for their commitment, focus, and professionalism. And lastly, much appreciation to our parent company AIG. It has been an extraordinary 12 months. We are experiencing one of the best markets for life insurers in recent memory, with interest rates at levels not seen in well over a decade, supporting our ability to manufacture products that are very attractive to our customers. We are making the most of these favorable conditions, notably delivering healthy organic growth in our spread-based products, and we have a constructive outlook for all of our businesses. Our ability to capitalize on this moment speaks to a broader theme about Corebridge. We are, at our core, a fundamentally nimble company. Our strong balance sheet, our broad and well-designed product suite, and our longstanding distribution relationships allow us to execute swiftly and position us to perform across a variety of market environments, ultimately benefiting both customers and shareholders. The advantages of our nimble approach are clear in our results. Premiums and deposits have grown by 28% this year, and base spread income has grown by 34% over the same period. The earnings power of our core insurance businesses is improving, aided by tailwinds from interest rates and credit spreads. Another hallmark for Corebridge during our first year has been our focused execution. This, combined with the strength of our business, have produced some exceptional accomplishments and continue to drive shareholder value. One important outcome of our focused execution has been our robust return of capital to shareholders. We have returned $1.4 billion to Corebridge shareholders since the IPO through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. This includes over $1.1 billion of dividends and $246 million of share repurchases. And yesterday, we declared our sixth consecutive quarterly dividend of $0.23 per share. In the third quarter, we achieved another significant milestone in our capital management program. We began open market buybacks, taking advantage of market conditions, and as of October 31, we have repurchased approximately $102 million of Corebridge stock. In another important accomplishment for our company, we continue to streamline our business portfolio through the sale of our international operations. This strategic initiative will allow us to focus on life and retirement products and solutions in the United States, the world's largest market, as well as unlock significant value for shareholders. Earlier this week, we announced that we closed the sale to AXA of Laya Healthcare, the second largest private health insurance provider in Ireland. We also declared a special dividend in the amount of approximately $730 million to be paid in November as we look to distribute proceeds from this sale. And we recently announced the sale of our UK life insurance business to Aviva for \u00a3460 million, which is expected to close in the first half of 2024, subject to regulatory approvals. This transaction is highly accretive and will have a negligible impact on future earnings. As noted yesterday on AIG's earnings call, we expect proceeds from this transaction largely will be used for share repurchases subject to market conditions. Together, the sale of these two businesses unlocks over $1.2 billion of value, enabling Corebridge to deliver additional significant return of capital to shareholders. Moving on to other areas of accomplishments over the past year. We have achieved or contracted on 81% of our exit run rate savings goal of $400 million from Corebridge Forward, our modernization program that is delivering both expense reduction and increased efficiency. We remain confident this program will be completed on time. We also continue to achieve consistent progress with Corebridge\u2019s operational separation from AIG, having exited 69% of the transition services agreements that were put in place at the time of our IPO. We now expect our cost to achieve will come in at the higher end of our range of $350 million to $450 million. And to date, we have incurred $366 million of the cost to complete our separation. Another area of achievement over the last 12 months has been the expansion of our strategic investment partnerships. These investment partnerships benefit Corebridge as well as our customers. By leveraging our relationship with Blackstone, we have increased our access to unique and attractive assets, enhancing the competitiveness of our products and our long-term growth profile. Since day one, Blackstone has been investing in assets with very attractive risk-adjusted returns, generating an average yield of 6.6% in an average credit quality of single A+. This investment activity has supported growth across all four of our business segments. With respect to BlackRock, we have fully integrated them in our day-to-day portfolio management, and we continue to make strides with our migration to their Aladdin platform, which will further modernize our infrastructure and provide us with expanded analytics and accounting capabilities. In total, with all of these accomplishments since the IPO, it has been a very successful first year for Corebridge. What's more is that our focused execution, combined with our stable high-quality business mix are contributing to steady improvements in our key financial metrics. As an example, our run rate return on average equity for the first nine months of 2023 was 12%, an improvement of 190 basis points since our IPO. We remain on a firm trajectory to achieve a 12% to 14% ROAE in 2024, one of the key financial targets we laid out when we launched Corebridge. Pivoting to the third quarter, we delivered another strong financial performance over the last three months extending the positive momentum that we have been building since the IPO. Elias will provide more detail during his remarks, but I will briefly touch on four important highlights. First, we have been able to grow our non-GAAP operating earnings per share by 28% and our adjusted return on average equity by 230 basis points, both on a year-over-year basis. This strong performance reflects the scale and depth of our spread-based business and our ability to operate across product lines to pursue profitable organic growth where the risk-adjusted returns are the greatest. Second, our earnings this quarter benefited from a slight net favorable impact arising from our annual assumption review. We had no significant reserve adjustments, an important detail that validates our sound governance and reserving framework as well as demonstrates the ongoing stability of our balance sheet. Third, our diversified businesses grew aggregate core sources of income by 11% year-over-year, benefiting from the cumulative effect of strong organic growth and improving base spread income. And fourth, we delivered $9.1 billion of premiums and deposits this quarter, reflecting strong customer demand for our spread-based products and the ongoing expansion of our business. Although we did not execute any significant pension risk transfer transactions during the quarter, the pipeline remains robust. Our consistent organic growth is supported by the strength of our leading distribution platform as well as our diverse suite of products that are attractive to customers and deliver strong return profiles. I began my remarks with a brief reflection on our performance since our initial public offering, and this is where I would like to end. I am proud of all that we have accomplished over the last year and I'm confident Corebridge will continue to generate shareholder value through focused execution, a strong balance sheet in our diverse and attractive businesses. I will now turn the call over to Elias to walk you through our third quarter results in more detail.\nElias Habayeb: Thank you, Kevin. As you just heard, Corebridge delivered another quarter of strong financial performance. Our profitability continues to improve and we remain on track to achieve our target ROE of 12% to 14% in 2024, driven by our capital return growth in our core sources of income and expense efficiencies. We continue to successfully manage our capital liquidity, balancing organic growth and shareholder return, while maintaining a healthy balance sheet. We reported third quarter adjusted pre-tax operating income of $813 million, or earnings per share of $1.05, an increase of 28% from the prior year quarter on a per share basis. Our operating EPS included a $0.03 impact from our positive actuarial assumption update, offset by a $0.12 impact from alternative investment returns below our long-term expectations. Now starting with net investment income. Net investment income for our insurance companies on an APTOI basis improved 28% year-over-year and is comprised of two components: base portfolio income and variable investment income. Our base portfolio income grew 22% over the prior year quarter to $2.4 billion. Additionally, the base yield increased 62 basis points to 4.7%. This improvement was driven by our ability to reinvest the entire new money yields, resets on floating rate assets, and an increase of total invested asset by approximately $11 billion. Importantly, our base yield growth has more than outweighed any increases in policyholder crediting rates. We expect base yields will continue to grow, albeit at the slower pace as we discussed during our second quarter's earnings call. The sequential rate of improvement was 10 basis points due to lower net inflows into the general account, which I will discuss during our segment results in combination with stability and short-term interest rates. While the short end of the curve did not materially change this quarter, we saw a substantial increase in medium and long-term rates, which will have a positive impact on our business. During the quarter, we remain focused on directing new investments towards higher credit quality assets with new money yields at very attractive levels. On average, this quarter's new money yields were approximately 6.6%, or 150 basis points above the assets that's matured or were sold in our general account. This is the fifth consecutive quarter where our new money yields have exceeded 6%. Year-to-date, first, interest yield exceeded our base yield by over 200 basis points. Our general account investment portfolio is resilient and positioned to perform well under various market conditions. The portfolio is well diversified, actively managed and remains high -quality with an average credit rating of single A flat. Furthermore, the portfolio continues to experience net positive ratings migrations without upgrades outpacing downgrades. Given the recent focus on commercial real estate, the credit metrics in our commercial mortgage loan portfolio are holding up well and remain strong. Our team has deep expertise in commercial real estate, and we have a history of actively managing the portfolio across different cycles. With respect to our $900 million of 2023 maturities in U.S. traditional office, I\u2019m pleased to report that we have successfully resolved all material maturities through extension or repayment. Now our team is working to address our 2024 maturities, of which traditional U.S. office comprises only about $350 million. We regularly stress and assess the portfolio, ensuring we maintain a robust loan loss allowance to mitigate potential credit losses. As a long-term investor with a strong balance sheet and resilient investment portfolio, we continue to seek select opportunities for value creation within the commercial real estate sector. Our exposure is manageable and we remain of the belief that dislocation in this market will play out over time. Moving to variable investment income. Our alternative investments, which represent only 3% of our total invested assets, delivered $18 million of income in the quarter. Traditional private equity gains were partially offset by real estate mark-to-market losses. Real estate equity comprises approximately 25% of our alternative investment portfolio. Given equity market and interest rate performance, we expect alternative investment returns to be below our long-term expectations in the fourth quarter. Shifting to GOE. Operating expenses for our insurance businesses and parent company were approximately $418 million, better by $10 million \u2013 10% on a year-to-date basis or 6% sequentially. This was driven by expense efficiencies from Corebridge Forward earning into our results, partially offset by incremental costs related to the establishment of our standalone public company capabilities. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect some seasonality in expenses. Now I'd like to take a moment to walk through our annual assumption update process as we are reporting this for the first time under LDTI. Once a year, principally in the third quarter, we review and update our actuarial assumptions for all lines of business. Our disciplined and consistent review covers economic, policyholder behavior, and mortality assumptions, which are based on our emerging experience, industry data, and other key factors. This year, Corebridge reported a nominal $22 million net positive impact to adjusted pre-tax operating income, mostly related to our Life Insurance segment. As Kevin stated, we had no significant reserve adjustments. Within our Life Insurance segment, the update included adjustments to our earned rate assumptions resulting from a higher interest rate environment as well as adjustments to policyholder and mortality assumptions for certain blocks of business. Looking ahead, we expect individual retirement DAC amortization run rate will increase by $11 million per quarter due to the higher interest rate environment as reflected in our third quarter results. Turning to our balance sheet. Our third quarter Life Fleet RBC ratio remains above target, which we estimate to be in the range of 410% to 420%. Our subsidiaries distributed $527 million during the quarter, bringing year-to-date distributions to $1.5 billion, evidencing the strong cash flow generation from our insurance businesses. As a result, we ended the quarter with $1.7 billion of holding company liquidity, exceeding our next 12-month needs and demonstrating our financial flexibility for returning capital to shareholders. We also issued $500 million of senior debt in September using the proceeds to partially repay our $1.5 billion delay-draw term loan facility. Now pivoting to our business segments, which continued their strong performance during the third quarter. Individual retirement reported adjusted pre-tax operating income of $576 million, up 54% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher base spread income, resulting from strong general account product growth and base spread expansion. Base net investment spread rose 62 basis points from the prior year quarter and 6 basis points sequentially. The strong value proposition of our spread-based products continues to drive robust demand for our fixed index and fixed annuities with our fixed index annuity business achieving three consecutive quarters of sales in excess of $2 billion. We had another quarter of positive general accounts net flows even with an increase in the fixed annuity surrender rate. Our third quarter surrender rate was elevated due to rising long-term interest rates, as well as the processing of an operational backlog resulting from our first quarter record sales. Our surrender rate peaked early in the quarter, but steadily trended lower and continued into October. At the same time, we saw an increase in our monthly sales of fixed annuities with September volumes approaching record levels. This is facilitated by our planned operational capacity expansion that has come online and is able to support sales volumes even exceeding that of our first quarter. Group retirement reported adjusted pre-tax operating income of $192 million, up 1% year-over-year. This includes lower base spread income reflecting a non-recurring gain in the third quarter of 2022. Excluding this item, base net investment spread rose 6 basis points from the prior year quarter while it fell 3 basis points sequentially. This decline was primarily due to higher policyholder crediting rates attributed to our group mutual fund product, which more than offset the increase in base yield. While we saw elevated surrender rates in the third quarter, this was mainly driven by one large group plan exit, which was predominantly invested in our group mutual fund product, thus having limited impact to earnings. Excluding the impact of large plan departures, our surrender rate has declined from the 11% at the beginning of the year to roughly 10% now. Consistent with industry experience, many of our plan participants have been entering retirement and therefore transitioning from accumulating assets to withdrawing funds for their retirement. As a result, net outflows are typically driven by plan participants ages 59.5 or older and tend to have a higher guaranteed minimum interest rate. Concurrently, net inflows are dominated by our younger age cohorts with lower guaranteed minimum interest rates as well as out of plan fixed and fixed index annuity sales and advisory and brokerage deposits. We expect the combination of those two trends will improve the economic return profile over time. Life insurance reported adjusted pre-tax operating income of $136 million, up 10% year-over-year, mainly driven by net investment income and expense efficiencies. Mortality experience, inclusive of reserve adjustments, remains consistent with our year-to-date experience and favorable to expectations. With respect to our sale of Laya, we expect this business to contribute approximately $30 million per year to Corebridge\u2019s pre-tax operating income. Results from this business are only included in our results through October 31. Institutional markets reported adjusted pre-tax operating income of $75 million, down $8 million year-over-year, primarily driven by less favorable mortality experience in our corporate markets business. Our reserves have grown $7 billion, or 23% year-over-year, driven by expansion of our pension risk transfer in GIC businesses. We issued a company record level of $1.9 billion of GICs in the third quarter as part of our strategy to become a more regular issuer of GICs. And lastly, our corporate and other segments reported an adjusted pre-tax operating loss of $166 million, primarily the result of our standalone capital structure and new parent company expenses since the IPO. Wrapping up, we continue to have the confidence and the strength of our balance sheet and the power of our franchise. Our liquidity and capital positions remain strong. We maintain a stable, diversified, and attractive liability portfolio that's optimized for risk-adjusted returns. We have minimal legacy liability risk, and then our investment portfolio is high-quality and well diversified. In addition, we maintain a very disciplined risk management framework focused on both sides of the balance sheet. Starting from this position of strength, we remain committed to returning attractive levels of capital beyond regular quarterly dividends and have the financial flexibility to do so. This concludes my remarks. So I'll now turn it back to Kevin.\nKevin Hogan: Thank you, Elias. And operator, we're now prepared for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Barnidge of Piper Sandler. John, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJohn Barnidge: Good morning. Thank you for the opportunity. You talked about one large group plan departure. Can you talk about visibility near-term and into 2024 on that? It feels like this is similar commentary seen elsewhere. Is there just more activity now than the last few normal years? Thank you.\nKevin Hogan: Yes. Thanks, John. So the reality is that during the pandemic, I think, with the kind of restricted access and some of the kind of intense focus on operations, that's true, we did see a slowdown in remarketing of group plans. And so after the pandemic, the level of group plan marketing has kind of returned to what we would have expected before the pandemic. And so there are some episodic activities in the large accounts. We did have a particularly large accounts surrender in the third quarter, but I think what's important to point out is that particular plan, by far the majority of the assets, over 90% of the assets were actually in the group mutual fund platform. So whilst it shows up in the flows and in the assets the impact on earnings is extremely modest. And so we do \u2013 we monitor where the large account losses and wins are coming from. Sometimes they're associated with consolidations, M&A activities, sometimes regular remarketing. But what's important is if we look at the underlying numbers, taking out the large plan sort of wins or losses, what we're seeing is that the surrender rate is actually coming down from close to 11% earlier in the year to now down closer to 10%. And we need to unpack those flows a little bit. We have an aging portfolio, and for those customers that are 59.5 years or older, right, they\u2019re in the utilization stage. And this is where the primary outflows are coming from in our portfolio or in those older ages. And those are also associated with the higher guaranteed minimum interest rate products because those customers have been around for some time. And what we are seeing is actually inflows, positive flows in the younger ages at lower guaranteed minimum interest rates, and then also investing in the advisory and brokerage platforms, which have become more popular in the last 10 years. And so we believe that for the in-plan business, the economic profile of the portfolio is improving. And then on top of that, we're seeing very robust sales in the out of plan annuities, particularly fixed annuities and we just launched an index annuities. For many of the same reasons we're seeing those products be very popular in the individual retirement side and we're seeing positive flows in the advisory and brokerage platform outside of the plan and those are not recorded in net flows. So we're very comfortable with where we are strategically in the retirement services business. We think that the economic profile of the portfolio is improving and not every dollar of net flows is equal. It's important not to be distracted by net flows.\nJohn Barnidge: Thank you for that. My follow-up, you began open market repurchases in September. Can you talk about the activity in October? And is that a reasonable run rate? Thanks for the answers.\nKevin Hogan: Yes. Elias, please.\nElias Habayeb: Hey John, it's Elias. Hope all is well. So John, listen, as you've seen, we generate the capacity to continue to buy shares. We started in the third quarter doing open market purchases, but given the average traded volumes we have, there's so much we could do in the open market. And so we have more capacity to buy shares beyond the open market. So to answer your question is we want to be a regular purchaser in the open market. But we're going to see what the best options are and how we purchase shares back and that's what we will pursue.\nJohn Barnidge: Thank you. Appreciate the answers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Elyse, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, I was hoping to get some of your initial thoughts on the impact of the new DOL rule and how you guys see that potentially impacting Corebridge?\nKevin Hogan: Thanks, Elyse. So look, one thing I'll say is we live in a very complex world, complex regulatory environment and part of our responsibility is to be able to master the complexity of that environment. And this DOL ruling is just the most recent ruling that we're in the process of interpreting and understanding. What I would say is that the words maybe different, but the concepts, many of the concepts in this ruling are similar to the fiduciary rule of 2016 and even some DOL activity earlier in the decade. And as a reminder, both our company as well as the industry actually implemented those regulations until they were overturned by the courts. And so this is territory that is reasonably familiar. It looks like that this ruling is really trying to expand ERISA-type obligations to all retirement-related advice or recommendations, et cetera. And I'll remind you that our company kind of grew up in the registered world, whether it's on the individual retirement side where we primarily work through registered reps of broker dealers or banks or in the retirement services side where our originations are through valid financial advisors, which is a duly registered RIA broker dealer. That is the primary source of business that we have. We are familiar and our distribution channels are familiar with the advisory framework that I think is being reflected in the intention of this DOL ruling. So a very high percentage, probably 90%-ish plus of our individual retirement sales and 100% of the VFA sales are already subject to a high level standard of duty of care. And although it's a big act, there's a lot of filings around it. It's in early stages. There will be a public comment period, et cetera. We're not anticipating, it's going to have a significant impact on our business.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my second question, you mentioned, right, that you have $1.7 billion at the Holdco, which exceeds next 12 months' needs. Is that what you guys are targeting, especially I guess when we get through some of the separation costs and the costs associated with your savings program?\nElias Habayeb: Hey, Elyse, it's Elias. Our target for the parent liquidity is to cover the next 12-month needs, and right now it's less than $1.7 billion, and that should come down as we complete the one-time spend on the initiatives we've talked about which were relating to Corebridge Forward and the separation from AIG. The first one is $300 million, the second one is $350 million to $450 million, and we'd expect that will be mostly done by the end of this year associated with it. And so we will kind of \u2013 what our need is will be coming down, but the position we are in right now is we are in excess of what our need is and that kind of demonstrates the financial flexibility and the strength of our insurance company cash flows. Our insurance companies have delivered $1.5 billion this year, which is in line with what they've distributed in the prior years. And that should be sufficient to get us to the 60% to 65% payout ratio, which we would expect to achieve in 2024. And we feel comfortable we're on track getting there.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you.\nKevin Hogan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Scott of Goldman Sachs. Alex, your line is open. Please proceed.\nAlex Scott: Hi, good morning. First one I have for you is just on potential further strategic action on the business. Certainly, I appreciate the two transactions you already did were quite attractive and interesting. So I hate to ask you so quickly about what next, but I'm going to do it anyway. So, what is the opportunity out there? What do you see in the market around private equity interests, some of the blocks of business you have around fixed, fixed and next annuities? Do you think there's an opportunity there?\nKevin Hogan: Yes. Thanks, Alex. So look, I mean we know our responsibility is to regularly review opportunities to increase shareholder value and to optimize the portfolio. I think we've demonstrated that. We did prioritize the disposition of the international businesses because one, it allows us to focus on the huge U.S. market; but also two, we saw an opportunity to generate significant value. And we're still working through the UK close. That'll take a little bit longer. It's a more complex environment. When it comes down to other types of transactions, look, we have demonstrated the willingness and the ability to execute on transactions. You just have to go back and look at our creation of what became Fortitude Re. And so we're familiar with the market, the opportunities, and we continue to evaluate the portfolio. Now, as a result of the creation of Fortitude Re, we have a high-quality in-force. But as you pointed out, we are current on what transaction terms are available in the market right now. We're conscious of where our share price is. And we are continuing to evaluate options whether in terms of enhancing the in-force or the efficiency of new business. So we don't have anything to update right now as and when we have something to update and then we'll provide more information at that time.\nAlex Scott: Very helpful. Second one I have for you is just going back to the comments made on DAC amortization in life insurance. I just wanted to check, I mean, is that higher run rate on DAC amortization, does that fall to the bottom line? And is that reflected in sort of the run rate that we're looking at from this quarter already or do we need to think about reducing by that amount looking forward?\nElias Habayeb: Hey, Alex, it's Elias. The $11 million DAC \u2013 the increase in the DAC run rates of $11 million, that's where individual retirement is not in life, and that's already in the third quarter numbers we published.\nAlex Scott: Got it. Okay. Thank you for the clarification.\nElias Habayeb: Yes. And it's coming across all three products, fixed, index and variable. So the impact is $11 million on a quarterly basis, and it's kicked in as of July 1.\nAlex Scott: Thank you.\nKevin Hogan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tom Gallagher of Evercore. Tom, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nThomas Gallagher: Good morning. Elias, the comment you made about the processing of backlog of surrenders that created higher fixed annuity outflows this quarter, and I think you also mentioned you're starting to see some acceleration of fixed annuity sales. Would you \u2013 taking that together, would you expect 4Q and beyond to get a bit better from a net flow perspective for overall individual retirement and fixed annuities in particular?\nKevin Hogan: Yes. Hey, Tom, it\u2019s Kevin. I think I'm going to fill this one. I'll start with the surrenders. Look, the third quarter surrenders were nominally high, but I think it's really important to unpack the behavior throughout the quarter because the trend did change. And essentially what happened is that the surrender levels did peak early in the quarter, which I think reflected some of the processing of the backlog that was there. And then we saw the opportunity, based on what sales were in the first half, we saw the opportunity and how attractive these products were for our customers. So we brought on some additional operational capacity which came online through the third quarter. And we did see the surrender rates successively come down from sort of the beginning of the quarter through the end. And we've seen that trend continuing through October. But at the same time as this new operational capacity came online, we started to see the pace of the fixed annuity sales increase incrementally through the quarter to the point where coming into October, the new sales levels are something comparable to what we saw in the very strong first quarter. And so we had overall net positive flows across IR in the third quarter despite that sort of trend. And if you look at the back half of the quarter as opposed to the front half of the quarter, and if that continues through the rest of the year, we would see some very attractive numbers coming out of fixed annuities. Index annuities continue to be very strong and we would expect growth in the overall general account. And I would also add that the margins continue to be extremely attractive for this business.\nThomas Gallagher: Interesting. Thank you. And then, Kevin, just on your comment in response to Alex's question on potential risk transfer, the point you made on efficiency of new business, should we take that to \u2013 I mean you're considering flow reinsurance as one potential option?\nKevin Hogan: Well, that\u2019s one potential option. There are a lot of ways to enhance efficiency of new business and we're in the process of reviewing those. Our responsibility is to evaluate all options to understand what transaction terms are and to make a decision that is most attractive for shareholder return opportunities as well as the success of the business.\nThomas Gallagher: Got it. And if I could just sneak in one more. Elias, you mentioned you're done with the \u2013 you've resolved office maturities for 2023. Can you just remind us, what was the total size of the maturities for 2023? And do you have a split of how much got paid off versus extended? And then when I heard you say only $350 million of office maturities in 2024, which sounds pretty low, that implies to me you didn't do any one-year extensions on the 2023 maturity wall.\nElias Habayeb: So yes. So Tom, so let me take. So we had about $900 million of maturities in traditional office. All the material loans are done. So from the ones we\u2019re done, that was a total of nine loans, five got paid off, four got extended. The four that extended tend to be bigger dollar amounts. And you're right, we did not have one-year extensions. Basically, there were longer-term extensions and what was involved were sometimes partial paydowns as well as credit enhancements for our positions in there. When you look at 2024 in traditional office, we have five loans that come down to about $350 million in principle.\nThomas Gallagher: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan. Jimmy, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJimmy Bhullar: Thanks. Good morning. So, Kevin, on your comments on flows, if I look at the index annuity business, that's showing nice growth both in terms of sales and flows. But the traditional fixed business seems weaker than what your commentary would suggest. So if you look at sales, they have grown, 1Q was very good, 2Q was actually weaker than last year, and 3Q is almost flat. And then if you look at flows, whether by each quarter or in totality, this year is running worse than last year. So I'm just trying to see what sort of \u2013 I would have expected with rates going up, fixed annuity sales would be \u2013 traditional fixed would be doing a lot better and many of your peers are doing better than what your numbers would suggest as well. So just trying to see why that business isn't picking up more, and why the draws are actually up even more this year than sales are up, even if you look at them on a year-to-date basis.\nKevin Hogan: Yes. What I would say, Jimmy, is that, I just described the trend throughout the third quarter. Obviously, it was very strong earlier in the year that created some kind of processing issues, I think, for the whole industry, because for the whole industry, the second quarter was lower than the first quarter. And through the third quarter, we actually have seen strength in the fixed annuity business and we do expect that that will continue, assuming conditions stay roughly where they are through the fourth quarter. As we've talked about before, we look at the economic value of a surrender versus the economic value of new business and to the extent that, it's not the right thing necessarily to increase crediting rates and accept the surrenders. We look at each of those decisions kind of separately. And we also look at the entire general account and the growth in the general accounts and the growth and spreads in the general accounts. So we have the benefit of having multiple products. We feel very comfortable with where the fixed annuity business is right now. The spreads are very attractive and we'll continue to respond to where the market opportunities are.\nJimmy Bhullar: And on spread, your spread both an individual and group retirement are at very good levels already. With rates going up even more, should we assume that spread will improve further or \u2013 because of competition or whatever, they\u2019ll \u2013 I'm assuming they'll be stable at the very least, but are you assuming further improvement in spreads or is competition taking over to where more of the increase is going to fall to the crediting rate?\nElias Habayeb: Hey, Jimmy, it's Elias. So on base spread income, we expect our income to continue to grow from here, given what we're seeing in our outlook. With respect to base spreads, base spreads are already at the very attractive level. There's still room for them to continue to expand more from where we're here, but we're expecting at some stage you're going to taper off. And as you've seen, the trajectory of improvement has slowed down, but it's still at very attractive levels.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And is competition in the fixed and index annuity markets with rates going up, would you characterize that as being rational or are you seeing a pickup in competition?\nKevin Hogan: For the distribution channels that we work with, the way I would define is the rationality of competition is what we're seeing as margins on new business and we continue to see very attractive margins on the new business.\nJimmy Bhullar: Thank you.\nKevin Hogan: Just as a reminder folks, one question and one follow-up please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Krueger of KBW. Ryan, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nRyan Krueger: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Many of your competitors in the annuity space as well as an increasing amount in the institutional market space utilize Bermuda for increased capital efficiency. Is that something that you would consider at Corebridge on a go-forward basis?\nKevin Hogan: So we're very familiar with the Bermuda environment. I point to the creation of Fortitude Re, which we engaged in a number of years ago. That was a transaction really specifically designed to access the best benefit of the environment there and it's long been an element of our operating strategy as part of AIG. So we do have a Bermuda entity. We are familiar with it. And one of the options that we're evaluating amongst many others in terms of where are the next opportunities to create value or optimize the portfolio would include potential offshore solutions.\nRyan Krueger: Great. And then I think, Elias, you mentioned some seasonality in the fourth quarter expenses. Can you give any color on the magnitude there?\nElias Habayeb: So there's a couple of drivers that impact our expenses fourth quarter. We do have some seasonality around some of our IT-related spend. That's maybe $10 million, $15 million. And then obviously year-end, there's always the bonus accrual true-ups depending where we end the year.\nRyan Krueger: Thank you.\nKevin Hogan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Ward of Citi. Mike, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ward: Thanks, guys. Good morning. Maybe just expanding on the questions around third-party risk transfer. I think flow reinsurance historically has been focused more on the fixed annuity side for new business at least, rather than variable. So just wondering if there's like a specific product line that you might be considering more than others.\nKevin Hogan: We're always looking for opportunities to optimize the whole portfolio. We're not going to talk about any particular product plan.\nMichael Ward: Okay. And then on institutional retirement, pension deal activity was kind of muted. So just curious if you could sort of comment on that slowdown from a sponsor's perspective and how they're feeling about the market.\nKevin Hogan: Yes. Thanks, Mike. Look, these are very large complex transactions and it is unpredictable when a particular program is going to land. You think of them as miniature M&A transactions because a great deal of work has to be done on the sponsor's side of assembling the asset portfolio and understanding the asset portfolio and then working with a consultant understanding the liability portfolio. And I wouldn't read anything into the relatively modest activity in the third quarter because the pipeline for transactions is \u2013 continues to grow and is very strong. And our focus, I'll remind you, is on full plan terminations. Historically, we have not really participated in the commodity, or retiree, longevity type deals. And full plan terminations, because of the external market conditions that exist, many plans are fully funded and are anxious to move to a full plan termination. So we're seeing more full plan terminations and we're seeing larger full plan terminations. And that's true both in the U.S. and in the UK. And we're in a extremely strong position in both markets and the pipeline is very strong. And so I think we will continue to see robust opportunities in the institutional markets business.\nMichael Ward: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nKevin Hogan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Suneet Kamath of Jefferies. Suneet, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nSuneet Kamath: Thanks. Good morning. I guess to start with Elias, the $2 billion of annual distributions that you are sort of guiding to out of the insurance subsidiary. Should we expect that to increase as some of these one-time costs are behind you?\nElias Habayeb: Hey, Suneet, it\u2019s Elias. So the one-time costs we're paying out of the parents, we're not paying out of the insurance companies. But right now, the insurance companies run rate is about $2 billion, what we expect over time as the profitability of the insurance companies improves, there will be more distributable earnings to maintain our 60% to 65% payout ratio over time.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay, got it. And then I guess for Kevin sort of interested in your comment about it being the best environment for the life space in some time. Can you just talk about how that impacts your decisions on capital allocation maybe across businesses or in total?\nKevin Hogan: Sure. So, I think that we have demonstrated over the last 10 years, frankly, that our business model can be successful whether it is a high-rate environment or a lower-rate environment. And right now in the higher-rate environment, we're certainly deploying capital into the spread businesses, whereas maybe some of those businesses may not have been as attractive five years or so ago, based on the environment at that time. And I think one of the great things about our business model is we can deploy capital where the risk-adjusted returns are the highest. And if we're not able to make the hurdles, then we won't necessarily deploy the capital into the new business. And so our strategy is to have a very strong balance sheet, a strong liquidity position, the appropriate leverage profile and allocate an appropriate amount of capital to new business, which is very attractive at this time, and still have the financial flexibility to return additional capital to shareholders. So right now, the environment is very attractive. We expect it will continue to. And what I feel really good about is we've been able to grow the business, the new business significantly in the last three quarters and continue to grow the balance sheet, strengthen the balance sheet and enhance our liquidity position and improve our leverage position.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. This is all the time we have questions for today. So I'll hand back over to Kevin Hogan, CEO, for any closing remarks.\nKevin Hogan: Okay, thanks. Look, it's been a year since our initial public offering and our results both for this quarter and since the IPO, I think, demonstrate the competitive strengths of our businesses as well as the resilience of our franchise. Our financial position is strong and our opportunities are robust. We're well positioned to continue creating value for and returning capital to our shareholders, building on the outstanding progress we've already achieved in our first year as a public company. Thank you for joining us. Have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Elias Habayeb",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. As you just heard, Corebridge delivered another quarter of strong financial performance. Our profitability continues to improve and we remain on track to achieve our target ROE of 12% to 14% in 2024, driven by our capital return growth in our core sources of income and expense efficiencies. We continue to successfully manage our capital liquidity, balancing organic growth and shareholder return, while maintaining a healthy balance sheet. We reported third quarter adjusted pre-tax operating income of $813 million, or earnings per share of $1.05, an increase of 28% from the prior year quarter on a per share basis. Our operating EPS included a $0.03 impact from our positive actuarial assumption update, offset by a $0.12 impact from alternative investment returns below our long-term expectations. Now starting with net investment income. Net investment income for our insurance companies on an APTOI basis improved 28% year-over-year and is comprised of two components: base portfolio income and variable investment income. Our base portfolio income grew 22% over the prior year quarter to $2.4 billion. Additionally, the base yield increased 62 basis points to 4.7%. This improvement was driven by our ability to reinvest the entire new money yields, resets on floating rate assets, and an increase of total invested asset by approximately $11 billion. Importantly, our base yield growth has more than outweighed any increases in policyholder crediting rates. We expect base yields will continue to grow, albeit at the slower pace as we discussed during our second quarter's earnings call. The sequential rate of improvement was 10 basis points due to lower net inflows into the general account, which I will discuss during our segment results in combination with stability and short-term interest rates. While the short end of the curve did not materially change this quarter, we saw a substantial increase in medium and long-term rates, which will have a positive impact on our business. During the quarter, we remain focused on directing new investments towards higher credit quality assets with new money yields at very attractive levels. On average, this quarter's new money yields were approximately 6.6%, or 150 basis points above the assets that's matured or were sold in our general account. This is the fifth consecutive quarter where our new money yields have exceeded 6%. Year-to-date, first, interest yield exceeded our base yield by over 200 basis points. Our general account investment portfolio is resilient and positioned to perform well under various market conditions. The portfolio is well diversified, actively managed and remains high -quality with an average credit rating of single A flat. Furthermore, the portfolio continues to experience net positive ratings migrations without upgrades outpacing downgrades. Given the recent focus on commercial real estate, the credit metrics in our commercial mortgage loan portfolio are holding up well and remain strong. Our team has deep expertise in commercial real estate, and we have a history of actively managing the portfolio across different cycles. With respect to our $900 million of 2023 maturities in U.S. traditional office, I'm pleased to report that we have successfully resolved all material maturities through extension or repayment. Now our team is working to address our 2024 maturities, of which traditional U.S. office comprises only about $350 million. We regularly stress and assess the portfolio, ensuring we maintain a robust loan loss allowance to mitigate potential credit losses. As a long-term investor with a strong balance sheet and resilient investment portfolio, we continue to seek select opportunities for value creation within the commercial real estate sector. Our exposure is manageable and we remain of the belief that dislocation in this market will play out over time. Moving to variable investment income. Our alternative investments, which represent only 3% of our total invested assets, delivered $18 million of income in the quarter. Traditional private equity gains were partially offset by real estate mark-to-market losses. Real estate equity comprises approximately 25% of our alternative investment portfolio. Given equity market and interest rate performance, we expect alternative investment returns to be below our long-term expectations in the fourth quarter. Shifting to GOE. Operating expenses for our insurance businesses and parent company were approximately $418 million, better by $10 million \u2013 10% on a year-to-date basis or 6% sequentially. This was driven by expense efficiencies from Corebridge Forward earning into our results, partially offset by incremental costs related to the establishment of our standalone public company capabilities. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect some seasonality in expenses. Now I'd like to take a moment to walk through our annual assumption update process as we are reporting this for the first time under LDTI. Once a year, principally in the third quarter, we review and update our actuarial assumptions for all lines of business. Our disciplined and consistent review covers economic, policyholder behavior, and mortality assumptions, which are based on our emerging experience, industry data, and other key factors. This year, Corebridge reported a nominal $22 million net positive impact to adjusted pre-tax operating income, mostly related to our Life Insurance segment. As Kevin stated, we had no significant reserve adjustments. Within our Life Insurance segment, the update included adjustments to our earned rate assumptions resulting from a higher interest rate environment as well as adjustments to policyholder and mortality assumptions for certain blocks of business. Looking ahead, we expect individual retirement DAC amortization run rate will increase by $11 million per quarter due to the higher interest rate environment as reflected in our third quarter results. Turning to our balance sheet. Our third quarter Life Fleet RBC ratio remains above target, which we estimate to be in the range of 410% to 420%. Our subsidiaries distributed $527 million during the quarter, bringing year-to-date distributions to $1.5 billion, evidencing the strong cash flow generation from our insurance businesses. As a result, we ended the quarter with $1.7 billion of holding company liquidity, exceeding our next 12-month needs and demonstrating our financial flexibility for returning capital to shareholders. We also issued $500 million of senior debt in September using the proceeds to partially repay our $1.5 billion delay-draw term loan facility. Now pivoting to our business segments, which continued their strong performance during the third quarter. Individual retirement reported adjusted pre-tax operating income of $576 million, up 54% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher base spread income, resulting from strong general account product growth and base spread expansion. Base net investment spread rose 62 basis points from the prior year quarter and 6 basis points sequentially. The strong value proposition of our spread-based products continues to drive robust demand for our fixed index and fixed annuities with our fixed index annuity business achieving three consecutive quarters of sales in excess of $2 billion. We had another quarter of positive general accounts net flows even with an increase in the fixed annuity surrender rate. Our third quarter surrender rate was elevated due to rising long-term interest rates, as well as the processing of an operational backlog resulting from our first quarter record sales. Our surrender rate peaked early in the quarter, but steadily trended lower and continued into October. At the same time, we saw an increase in our monthly sales of fixed annuities with September volumes approaching record levels. This is facilitated by our planned operational capacity expansion that has come online and is able to support sales volumes even exceeding that of our first quarter. Group retirement reported adjusted pre-tax operating income of $192 million, up 1% year-over-year. This includes lower base spread income reflecting a non-recurring gain in the third quarter of 2022. Excluding this item, base net investment spread rose 6 basis points from the prior year quarter while it fell 3 basis points sequentially. This decline was primarily due to higher policyholder crediting rates attributed to our group mutual fund product, which more than offset the increase in base yield. While we saw elevated surrender rates in the third quarter, this was mainly driven by one large group plan exit, which was predominantly invested in our group mutual fund product, thus having limited impact to earnings. Excluding the impact of large plan departures, our surrender rate has declined from the 11% at the beginning of the year to roughly 10% now. Consistent with industry experience, many of our plan participants have been entering retirement and therefore transitioning from accumulating assets to withdrawing funds for their retirement. As a result, net outflows are typically driven by plan participants ages 59.5 or older and tend to have a higher guaranteed minimum interest rate. Concurrently, net inflows are dominated by our younger age cohorts with lower guaranteed minimum interest rates as well as out of plan fixed and fixed index annuity sales and advisory and brokerage deposits. We expect the combination of those two trends will improve the economic return profile over time. Life insurance reported adjusted pre-tax operating income of $136 million, up 10% year-over-year, mainly driven by net investment income and expense efficiencies. Mortality experience, inclusive of reserve adjustments, remains consistent with our year-to-date experience and favorable to expectations. With respect to our sale of Laya, we expect this business to contribute approximately $30 million per year to Corebridge's pre-tax operating income. Results from this business are only included in our results through October 31. Institutional markets reported adjusted pre-tax operating income of $75 million, down $8 million year-over-year, primarily driven by less favorable mortality experience in our corporate markets business. Our reserves have grown $7 billion, or 23% year-over-year, driven by expansion of our pension risk transfer in GIC businesses. We issued a company record level of $1.9 billion of GICs in the third quarter as part of our strategy to become a more regular issuer of GICs. And lastly, our corporate and other segments reported an adjusted pre-tax operating loss of $166 million, primarily the result of our standalone capital structure and new parent company expenses since the IPO. Wrapping up, we continue to have the confidence and the strength of our balance sheet and the power of our franchise. Our liquidity and capital positions remain strong. We maintain a stable, diversified, and attractive liability portfolio that's optimized for risk-adjusted returns. We have minimal legacy liability risk, and then our investment portfolio is high-quality and well diversified. In addition, we maintain a very disciplined risk management framework focused on both sides of the balance sheet. Starting from this position of strength, we remain committed to returning attractive levels of capital beyond regular quarterly dividends and have the financial flexibility to do so. This concludes my remarks. So I'll now turn it back to Kevin. Hey John, it's Elias. Hope all is well. So John, listen, as you've seen, we generate the capacity to continue to buy shares. We started in the third quarter doing open market purchases, but given the average traded volumes we have, there's so much we could do in the open market. And so we have more capacity to buy shares beyond the open market. So to answer your question is we want to be a regular purchaser in the open market. But we're going to see what the best options are and how we purchase shares back and that's what we will pursue. Hey, Elyse, it's Elias. Our target for the parent liquidity is to cover the next 12-month needs, and right now it's less than $1.7 billion, and that should come down as we complete the one-time spend on the initiatives we've talked about which were relating to Corebridge Forward and the separation from AIG. The first one is $300 million, the second one is $350 million to $450 million, and we'd expect that will be mostly done by the end of this year associated with it. And so we will kind of \u2013 what our need is will be coming down, but the position we are in right now is we are in excess of what our need is and that kind of demonstrates the financial flexibility and the strength of our insurance company cash flows. Our insurance companies have delivered $1.5 billion this year, which is in line with what they've distributed in the prior years. And that should be sufficient to get us to the 60% to 65% payout ratio, which we would expect to achieve in 2024. And we feel comfortable we're on track getting there. Hey, Alex, it's Elias. The $11 million DAC \u2013 the increase in the DAC run rates of $11 million, that's where individual retirement is not in life, and that's already in the third quarter numbers we published. Yes. And it's coming across all three products, fixed, index and variable. So the impact is $11 million on a quarterly basis, and it's kicked in as of July 1. So yes. So Tom, so let me take. So we had about $900 million of maturities in traditional office. All the material loans are done. So from the ones we're done, that was a total of nine loans, five got paid off, four got extended. The four that extended tend to be bigger dollar amounts. And you're right, we did not have one-year extensions. Basically, there were longer-term extensions and what was involved were sometimes partial paydowns as well as credit enhancements for our positions in there. When you look at 2024 in traditional office, we have five loans that come down to about $350 million in principle. Hey, Jimmy, it's Elias. So on base spread income, we expect our income to continue to grow from here, given what we're seeing in our outlook. With respect to base spreads, base spreads are already at the very attractive level. There's still room for them to continue to expand more from where we're here, but we're expecting at some stage you're going to taper off. And as you've seen, the trajectory of improvement has slowed down, but it's still at very attractive levels. So there's a couple of drivers that impact our expenses fourth quarter. We do have some seasonality around some of our IT-related spend. That's maybe $10 million, $15 million. And then obviously year-end, there's always the bonus accrual true-ups depending where we end the year. Hey, Suneet, it's Elias. So the one-time costs we're paying out of the parents, we're not paying out of the insurance companies. But right now, the insurance companies run rate is about $2 billion, what we expect over time as the profitability of the insurance companies improves, there will be more distributable earnings to maintain our 60% to 65% payout ratio over time."

            "name": "Kevin Hogan",
            "content": "Thank you, Is\u0327\u0131l, and hello, everyone. This morning, we present our third quarter 2023 results. We delivered another strong quarter and executed with focus and precision across our strategic and operational priorities. Before reviewing our performance for the last three months, I want to share with you the outstanding progress we have made over the last year. On September 15, 2022, Corebridge had its initial public offering and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Since then, our first year as a public company has been a very successful one. Allow me a moment to offer my gratitude to everyone involved. Thank you to our many partners across the industry. Thank you to our customers and clients. And, of course, thank you to our employees. I'm so very proud of our people for their dedication to our company and customers and for their commitment, focus, and professionalism. And lastly, much appreciation to our parent company AIG. It has been an extraordinary 12 months. We are experiencing one of the best markets for life insurers in recent memory, with interest rates at levels not seen in well over a decade, supporting our ability to manufacture products that are very attractive to our customers. We are making the most of these favorable conditions, notably delivering healthy organic growth in our spread-based products, and we have a constructive outlook for all of our businesses. Our ability to capitalize on this moment speaks to a broader theme about Corebridge. We are, at our core, a fundamentally nimble company. Our strong balance sheet, our broad and well-designed product suite, and our longstanding distribution relationships allow us to execute swiftly and position us to perform across a variety of market environments, ultimately benefiting both customers and shareholders. The advantages of our nimble approach are clear in our results. Premiums and deposits have grown by 28% this year, and base spread income has grown by 34% over the same period. The earnings power of our core insurance businesses is improving, aided by tailwinds from interest rates and credit spreads. Another hallmark for Corebridge during our first year has been our focused execution. This, combined with the strength of our business, have produced some exceptional accomplishments and continue to drive shareholder value. One important outcome of our focused execution has been our robust return of capital to shareholders. We have returned $1.4 billion to Corebridge shareholders since the IPO through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. This includes over $1.1 billion of dividends and $246 million of share repurchases. And yesterday, we declared our sixth consecutive quarterly dividend of $0.23 per share. In the third quarter, we achieved another significant milestone in our capital management program. We began open market buybacks, taking advantage of market conditions, and as of October 31, we have repurchased approximately $102 million of Corebridge stock. In another important accomplishment for our company, we continue to streamline our business portfolio through the sale of our international operations. This strategic initiative will allow us to focus on life and retirement products and solutions in the United States, the world's largest market, as well as unlock significant value for shareholders. Earlier this week, we announced that we closed the sale to AXA of Laya Healthcare, the second largest private health insurance provider in Ireland. We also declared a special dividend in the amount of approximately $730 million to be paid in November as we look to distribute proceeds from this sale. And we recently announced the sale of our UK life insurance business to Aviva for \u00a3460 million, which is expected to close in the first half of 2024, subject to regulatory approvals. This transaction is highly accretive and will have a negligible impact on future earnings. As noted yesterday on AIG's earnings call, we expect proceeds from this transaction largely will be used for share repurchases subject to market conditions. Together, the sale of these two businesses unlocks over $1.2 billion of value, enabling Corebridge to deliver additional significant return of capital to shareholders. Moving on to other areas of accomplishments over the past year. We have achieved or contracted on 81% of our exit run rate savings goal of $400 million from Corebridge Forward, our modernization program that is delivering both expense reduction and increased efficiency. We remain confident this program will be completed on time. We also continue to achieve consistent progress with Corebridge's operational separation from AIG, having exited 69% of the transition services agreements that were put in place at the time of our IPO. We now expect our cost to achieve will come in at the higher end of our range of $350 million to $450 million. And to date, we have incurred $366 million of the cost to complete our separation. Another area of achievement over the last 12 months has been the expansion of our strategic investment partnerships. These investment partnerships benefit Corebridge as well as our customers. By leveraging our relationship with Blackstone, we have increased our access to unique and attractive assets, enhancing the competitiveness of our products and our long-term growth profile. Since day one, Blackstone has been investing in assets with very attractive risk-adjusted returns, generating an average yield of 6.6% in an average credit quality of single A+. This investment activity has supported growth across all four of our business segments. With respect to BlackRock, we have fully integrated them in our day-to-day portfolio management, and we continue to make strides with our migration to their Aladdin platform, which will further modernize our infrastructure and provide us with expanded analytics and accounting capabilities. In total, with all of these accomplishments since the IPO, it has been a very successful first year for Corebridge. What's more is that our focused execution, combined with our stable high-quality business mix are contributing to steady improvements in our key financial metrics. As an example, our run rate return on average equity for the first nine months of 2023 was 12%, an improvement of 190 basis points since our IPO. We remain on a firm trajectory to achieve a 12% to 14% ROAE in 2024, one of the key financial targets we laid out when we launched Corebridge. Pivoting to the third quarter, we delivered another strong financial performance over the last three months extending the positive momentum that we have been building since the IPO. Elias will provide more detail during his remarks, but I will briefly touch on four important highlights. First, we have been able to grow our non-GAAP operating earnings per share by 28% and our adjusted return on average equity by 230 basis points, both on a year-over-year basis. This strong performance reflects the scale and depth of our spread-based business and our ability to operate across product lines to pursue profitable organic growth where the risk-adjusted returns are the greatest. Second, our earnings this quarter benefited from a slight net favorable impact arising from our annual assumption review. We had no significant reserve adjustments, an important detail that validates our sound governance and reserving framework as well as demonstrates the ongoing stability of our balance sheet. Third, our diversified businesses grew aggregate core sources of income by 11% year-over-year, benefiting from the cumulative effect of strong organic growth and improving base spread income. And fourth, we delivered $9.1 billion of premiums and deposits this quarter, reflecting strong customer demand for our spread-based products and the ongoing expansion of our business. Although we did not execute any significant pension risk transfer transactions during the quarter, the pipeline remains robust. Our consistent organic growth is supported by the strength of our leading distribution platform as well as our diverse suite of products that are attractive to customers and deliver strong return profiles. I began my remarks with a brief reflection on our performance since our initial public offering, and this is where I would like to end. I am proud of all that we have accomplished over the last year and I'm confident Corebridge will continue to generate shareholder value through focused execution, a strong balance sheet in our diverse and attractive businesses. I will now turn the call over to Elias to walk you through our third quarter results in more detail. Thank you, Elias. And operator, we're now prepared for questions. Yes. Thanks, John. So the reality is that during the pandemic, I think, with the kind of restricted access and some of the kind of intense focus on operations, that's true, we did see a slowdown in remarketing of group plans. And so after the pandemic, the level of group plan marketing has kind of returned to what we would have expected before the pandemic. And so there are some episodic activities in the large accounts. We did have a particularly large accounts surrender in the third quarter, but I think what's important to point out is that particular plan, by far the majority of the assets, over 90% of the assets were actually in the group mutual fund platform. So whilst it shows up in the flows and in the assets the impact on earnings is extremely modest. And so we do \u2013 we monitor where the large account losses and wins are coming from. Sometimes they're associated with consolidations, M&A activities, sometimes regular remarketing. But what's important is if we look at the underlying numbers, taking out the large plan sort of wins or losses, what we're seeing is that the surrender rate is actually coming down from close to 11% earlier in the year to now down closer to 10%. And we need to unpack those flows a little bit. We have an aging portfolio, and for those customers that are 59.5 years or older, right, they're in the utilization stage. And this is where the primary outflows are coming from in our portfolio or in those older ages. And those are also associated with the higher guaranteed minimum interest rate products because those customers have been around for some time. And what we are seeing is actually inflows, positive flows in the younger ages at lower guaranteed minimum interest rates, and then also investing in the advisory and brokerage platforms, which have become more popular in the last 10 years. And so we believe that for the in-plan business, the economic profile of the portfolio is improving. And then on top of that, we're seeing very robust sales in the out of plan annuities, particularly fixed annuities and we just launched an index annuities. For many of the same reasons we're seeing those products be very popular in the individual retirement side and we're seeing positive flows in the advisory and brokerage platform outside of the plan and those are not recorded in net flows. So we're very comfortable with where we are strategically in the retirement services business. We think that the economic profile of the portfolio is improving and not every dollar of net flows is equal. It's important not to be distracted by net flows. Yes. Elias, please. Thanks, Elyse. So look, one thing I'll say is we live in a very complex world, complex regulatory environment and part of our responsibility is to be able to master the complexity of that environment. And this DOL ruling is just the most recent ruling that we're in the process of interpreting and understanding. What I would say is that the words maybe different, but the concepts, many of the concepts in this ruling are similar to the fiduciary rule of 2016 and even some DOL activity earlier in the decade. And as a reminder, both our company as well as the industry actually implemented those regulations until they were overturned by the courts. And so this is territory that is reasonably familiar. It looks like that this ruling is really trying to expand ERISA-type obligations to all retirement-related advice or recommendations, et cetera. And I'll remind you that our company kind of grew up in the registered world, whether it's on the individual retirement side where we primarily work through registered reps of broker dealers or banks or in the retirement services side where our originations are through valid financial advisors, which is a duly registered RIA broker dealer. That is the primary source of business that we have. We are familiar and our distribution channels are familiar with the advisory framework that I think is being reflected in the intention of this DOL ruling. So a very high percentage, probably 90%-ish plus of our individual retirement sales and 100% of the VFA sales are already subject to a high level standard of duty of care. And although it's a big act, there's a lot of filings around it. It's in early stages. There will be a public comment period, et cetera. We're not anticipating, it's going to have a significant impact on our business. Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Alex. So look, I mean we know our responsibility is to regularly review opportunities to increase shareholder value and to optimize the portfolio. I think we've demonstrated that. We did prioritize the disposition of the international businesses because one, it allows us to focus on the huge U.S. market; but also two, we saw an opportunity to generate significant value. And we're still working through the UK close. That'll take a little bit longer. It's a more complex environment. When it comes down to other types of transactions, look, we have demonstrated the willingness and the ability to execute on transactions. You just have to go back and look at our creation of what became Fortitude Re. And so we're familiar with the market, the opportunities, and we continue to evaluate the portfolio. Now, as a result of the creation of Fortitude Re, we have a high-quality in-force. But as you pointed out, we are current on what transaction terms are available in the market right now. We're conscious of where our share price is. And we are continuing to evaluate options whether in terms of enhancing the in-force or the efficiency of new business. So we don't have anything to update right now as and when we have something to update and then we'll provide more information at that time. Thank you. Yes. Hey, Tom, it's Kevin. I think I'm going to fill this one. I'll start with the surrenders. Look, the third quarter surrenders were nominally high, but I think it's really important to unpack the behavior throughout the quarter because the trend did change. And essentially what happened is that the surrender levels did peak early in the quarter, which I think reflected some of the processing of the backlog that was there. And then we saw the opportunity, based on what sales were in the first half, we saw the opportunity and how attractive these products were for our customers. So we brought on some additional operational capacity which came online through the third quarter. And we did see the surrender rates successively come down from sort of the beginning of the quarter through the end. And we've seen that trend continuing through October. But at the same time as this new operational capacity came online, we started to see the pace of the fixed annuity sales increase incrementally through the quarter to the point where coming into October, the new sales levels are something comparable to what we saw in the very strong first quarter. And so we had overall net positive flows across IR in the third quarter despite that sort of trend. And if you look at the back half of the quarter as opposed to the front half of the quarter, and if that continues through the rest of the year, we would see some very attractive numbers coming out of fixed annuities. Index annuities continue to be very strong and we would expect growth in the overall general account. And I would also add that the margins continue to be extremely attractive for this business. Well, that's one potential option. There are a lot of ways to enhance efficiency of new business and we're in the process of reviewing those. Our responsibility is to evaluate all options to understand what transaction terms are and to make a decision that is most attractive for shareholder return opportunities as well as the success of the business. Yes. What I would say, Jimmy, is that, I just described the trend throughout the third quarter. Obviously, it was very strong earlier in the year that created some kind of processing issues, I think, for the whole industry, because for the whole industry, the second quarter was lower than the first quarter. And through the third quarter, we actually have seen strength in the fixed annuity business and we do expect that that will continue, assuming conditions stay roughly where they are through the fourth quarter. As we've talked about before, we look at the economic value of a surrender versus the economic value of new business and to the extent that, it's not the right thing necessarily to increase crediting rates and accept the surrenders. We look at each of those decisions kind of separately. And we also look at the entire general account and the growth in the general accounts and the growth and spreads in the general accounts. So we have the benefit of having multiple products. We feel very comfortable with where the fixed annuity business is right now. The spreads are very attractive and we'll continue to respond to where the market opportunities are. For the distribution channels that we work with, the way I would define is the rationality of competition is what we're seeing as margins on new business and we continue to see very attractive margins on the new business. Just as a reminder folks, one question and one follow-up please. So we're very familiar with the Bermuda environment. I point to the creation of Fortitude Re, which we engaged in a number of years ago. That was a transaction really specifically designed to access the best benefit of the environment there and it's long been an element of our operating strategy as part of AIG. So we do have a Bermuda entity. We are familiar with it. And one of the options that we're evaluating amongst many others in terms of where are the next opportunities to create value or optimize the portfolio would include potential offshore solutions. Thank you. We're always looking for opportunities to optimize the whole portfolio. We're not going to talk about any particular product plan. Yes. Thanks, Mike. Look, these are very large complex transactions and it is unpredictable when a particular program is going to land. You think of them as miniature M&A transactions because a great deal of work has to be done on the sponsor's side of assembling the asset portfolio and understanding the asset portfolio and then working with a consultant understanding the liability portfolio. And I wouldn't read anything into the relatively modest activity in the third quarter because the pipeline for transactions is \u2013 continues to grow and is very strong. And our focus, I'll remind you, is on full plan terminations. Historically, we have not really participated in the commodity, or retiree, longevity type deals. And full plan terminations, because of the external market conditions that exist, many plans are fully funded and are anxious to move to a full plan termination. So we're seeing more full plan terminations and we're seeing larger full plan terminations. And that's true both in the U.S. and in the UK. And we're in a extremely strong position in both markets and the pipeline is very strong. And so I think we will continue to see robust opportunities in the institutional markets business. Thank you. Sure. So, I think that we have demonstrated over the last 10 years, frankly, that our business model can be successful whether it is a high-rate environment or a lower-rate environment. And right now in the higher-rate environment, we're certainly deploying capital into the spread businesses, whereas maybe some of those businesses may not have been as attractive five years or so ago, based on the environment at that time. And I think one of the great things about our business model is we can deploy capital where the risk-adjusted returns are the highest. And if we're not able to make the hurdles, then we won't necessarily deploy the capital into the new business. And so our strategy is to have a very strong balance sheet, a strong liquidity position, the appropriate leverage profile and allocate an appropriate amount of capital to new business, which is very attractive at this time, and still have the financial flexibility to return additional capital to shareholders. So right now, the environment is very attractive. We expect it will continue to. And what I feel really good about is we've been able to grow the business, the new business significantly in the last three quarters and continue to grow the balance sheet, strengthen the balance sheet and enhance our liquidity position and improve our leverage position. Okay, thanks. Look, it's been a year since our initial public offering and our results both for this quarter and since the IPO, I think, demonstrate the competitive strengths of our businesses as well as the resilience of our franchise. Our financial position is strong and our opportunities are robust. We're well positioned to continue creating value for and returning capital to our shareholders, building on the outstanding progress we've already achieved in our first year as a public company. Thank you for joining us. Have a good day."

[Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Josh Smith, Investor Relations with Corebridge Financial. Josh, please go ahead.\nJosh Smith: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Corebridge Financial's earnings update for the second quarter of 2023. Joining me on the call are Kevin Hogan, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Elias Habayeb, Chief Financial Officer.

The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at investors.corebridgefinancial.com. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Kevin.\nKevin Hogan: Thank you, Josh, and good morning, everyone. This was another excellent quarter for Corebridge. We continue to benefit from focused execution, disciplined risk management and the competitive strengths of our diversified businesses. During the second quarter, we returned $750 million to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, bringing the total capital return since our initial public offering to $1.2 billion. With this milestone, we are honoring our commitment to begin to return capital beyond regular quarterly dividends within 9 months of the IPO. We remain focused on our capital management strategies, and we are on track to achieve a 60% to 65% payout ratio in 2024. This morning, I will focus on our strong financial performance and provide an update on the progress we are making towards our key financial targets as well as our strategic and operational priorities. For the second quarter, Corebridge reported operating earnings per share of $1.04 with an adjusted return on average equity of 11.7%. This reflects strong results from our core businesses as we remain well positioned to capitalize on current market opportunities. Base spread income rose 42% year-over-year, benefiting from higher new money yields as well as the cumulative effect of ongoing strong growth in our spread-based products. Across our 4 businesses, we delivered robust sales, generating approximately $10 billion of premiums and deposits, 42% higher than the prior year quarter. Second quarter conditions remained attractive for spread-based products, and we produced another quarter of robust new business, most notably in pension risk transfer and fixed index annuity. In institutional markets, we executed $1.9 billion of pension risk transfers. Our pipeline is strong, and we have positioned ourselves well to support the growing demand for full plan terminations. We also issued over $900 million of guaranteed investment contracts. For individual retirement, we produced $2.3 billion of fixed index annuity sales, a record-setting quarter for us in this product category. Conditions remain very favorable for fixed index products, and we expect the strong customer value proposition to continue driving sales in this environment. With respect to fixed annuity, we continue to deliver strong sales, reaching nearly $1.3 billion. We balanced market opportunities with meeting the operational demands of this product in light of the volume of transactions associated with our record level first quarter. The market remains attractive, and we will continue to respond within the context of our entire product portfolio. As the second quarter demonstrated, one of the key strengths of Corebridge is the ability to operate across product lines and respond to market dynamics while continuing to pursue profitable organic growth where risk-adjusted returns are the greatest. Thinking about the second half of the year, we expect favorable conditions for spread-based products to continue. We will remain disciplined with our capital deployment, simultaneously balancing competitiveness with margins and operational demands. Before I move away from sales, I want to take a moment to recognize the significant contributions our distribution platform has made to our organic growth. Corebridge Financial distributors is our team of in-house professionals with strategic long-term relationships across all of our distribution partners, including banks, broker-dealers, general and independent agencies and independent marketing organizations. Corebridge Financial distributors has enabled us to build a leading distribution platform through a range of partnerships. In the second quarter, this team was responsible for delivering over $9 billion of our premiums and deposits. We believe the breadth of our product offerings and long history of partnerships strengthen our relationships and serve as the foundation for our success. Let me now shift to some other areas of strength for Corebridge. In the 9 months since our initial public offering, we have consistently focused on executing our strategic and operational priorities and achieving our financial targets. We have begun to deliver significant return of capital to shareholders, and we are on track to meet our targeted adjusted return on equity and payout ratio in 2024. We are also well on our way towards achieving the promised run rate savings from Corebridge Forward as we have discussed on previous calls, and we are making consistent progress in our operational separation from AIG. Our actions over the last several quarters demonstrate the confidence we have in our balance sheet and the strength of our cash flows. Yesterday, we declared our fifth consecutive quarterly dividend of $0.23 per share. With this dividend, we will have returned over $1.35 billion in capital to shareholders since our IPO. This includes regular quarterly cash dividends totaling approximately $750 million, along with a special dividend in June of just over $400 million. Also in June, we repurchased $200 million of shares from AIG and Blackstone. This leaves us with $800 million remaining from the initial $1 billion share repurchase authorization we announced in May. Shifting to return on equity. Our run rate ROE for the first half of 2023 was approximately 12%. At the time of our IPO, our run rate was about 10%. This improvement was driven in large part by strong organic growth and improving base spread income. Looking ahead, we believe we are on a firm trajectory to achieve a 12% to 14% ROE in 2024, in line with one of the key financial targets we laid out when we launched Corebridge. With regards to Corebridge Forward, our modernization program that will deliver both expense reduction and increased efficiency, we have accelerated timing wherever possible and remain ahead of plan, having achieved or contracted on 75% of our exit run rate savings goal of $400 million. Thus far, we have largely completed the initiatives related to refining our target operating model and expanding our outsourcing with existing partners. The bulk of the remaining work is focused on modernizing our IT infrastructure and rationalizing our real estate footprint, which is expected to be complete in 2024. The last leg of our incremental cost savings will be driven by significant milestones and will not be linear. Above all, we remain confident that Corebridge Forward will be completed on time and that the majority of the run rate savings will be achieved within 24 months of our IPO. And we are on track with our operational separation from AIG. Given the progress we have made establishing our stand-alone capabilities as a publicly-traded company, the majority of our remaining work will be on the separation of shared IT applications, which we continue to believe will be mostly complete in 2023 with some work extending into 2024. Turning to other strategic actions. You saw in our announcement yesterday that we've agreed to sell our health insurance business in Ireland, Laya Healthcare, to AXA for \u20ac650 million, unlocking significant value for our shareholders. We expect the transaction will close in the fourth quarter subject to regulatory approvals. As noted on AIG's earnings call, we expect proceeds from this transaction will largely be used for a special dividend to Corebridge shareholders. Additionally, as also mentioned during AIG's earnings call, we recently retained advisers to analyze strategic alternatives for the disposition of our U.K. Life business. The dispositions of Laya and U.K. Life will streamline our portfolio and allow us to focus on life and retirement products and solutions in the United States. In conclusion, I am very pleased with our performance in the second quarter. Our broad product platform, diverse sources of earnings and very strong network of distribution partners stand as important strategic advantages for Corebridge and position us well to perform in different market environments. We continue to see favorable operating trends driving an increase in aggregate core sources of income. We are executing our strategic initiatives and believe the strength of our franchise and balance sheet will enable us to continue to create value for our shareholders. We are delivering on our commitment to return attractive levels of capital beyond regular quarterly dividends, and we are on pace to achieve a 60% to 65% payout ratio as well as a 12% to 14% return on equity in 2024. Now I will turn the call over to Elias.\nElias Habayeb : Thank you, Kevin. This morning, I'll provide key highlights on our strong financial performance in the second quarter as well as provide an update on our balance sheet and capital management activities. Corebridge continues to make great progress delivering on its goals with favorable trends supporting the growth of spread products, especially in individual retirement and institutional markets. Earlier today, we reported earnings per share of $1.04, which was up 37% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. We also reported an adjusted ROE of 11.7% for the second quarter, which puts us at a run rate of approximately 12%. Adjusted pretax operating income was $836 million, an increase of $225 million compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding variable investment income, adjusted pretax operating income was 51% higher than the prior year quarter, largely due to higher base spread income, partially offset by interest expense on financial debt issued in the second and third quarters of 2022. Sequentially, our reported adjusted pretax operating income was $112 million higher than the first quarter due to improved base spread income and variable investment income as well as lower expenses. Our aggregate core sources of income increased by 18% year-over-year, driven by the growth of base spread income and underwriting margin, partially offset by the decline of fee income. Assets under management and administration ended the quarter at $372 billion, up 4% year-over-year or 1% sequentially. Turning to net investment income and our investment portfolio. Net investment income for our insurance subsidiaries on an adjusted pretax operating income basis was $2.5 billion, up 24% year-over-year or 8% sequentially. Our net investment income continues to reflect strong base portfolio income, offset by variable investment income below historical averages. Base portfolio income was $2.4 billion, up 27% year-over-year or 5% sequentially. The yield on our base asset portfolio was 4.6%, up 76 basis points year-over-year and 18 basis points sequentially, driven by a combination of reinvestment activity at higher new money yields and an increase in total invested assets. Total invested assets grew approximately $10 billion year-over-year or over $1 billion sequentially on a book basis. Average new money yields were over 6.6% in the second quarter, approximately 220 basis points higher than the average yield on assets rolling out of the portfolio. This is the fourth consecutive quarter with significant yield uplift. While we expect the favorable trend to continue based on current new money yields, the quantum of sequential improvement may slow down. Variable investment income was $96 million for the quarter, down 20% year-over-year or up 243% sequentially. On an annualized basis, our alternatives investment portfolio returned over 6% for the second quarter. Private equity and hedge fund returns were higher than the prior year quarter, while real estate equity returns were lower, reflecting the lack of material sales and the impact of cap rates on property valuations. Real estate equity currently comprises approximately 25% of our alternative investments. Our investment portfolio remains high quality, well diversified and actively managed. It's predominantly invested in fixed income assets, which comprise 97% of our portfolio, with the remaining 3% in alternative investments. Approximately 94% of our fixed maturity investments are rated investment grade as of the end of the quarter. We continue to direct new investments towards higher credit quality assets. This, together with net positive credit migration and ongoing derisking activities, improve the overall weighted average credit rating of our fixed maturity securities in the second quarter from a single A minus in the previous quarter to single A flat. Year-to-date, we reduced our below investment-grade exposure by approximately $1 billion, primarily due to targeted sales. Our recent purchases, including highly-rated structured products and private placements as well as residential mortgage loans and non-agency RMBS, these assets are well matched to the insurance liabilities we've been originating recently. Blackstone executed nearly $1.5 billion of new transactions for our general account during the second quarter, including private and structured credit as well as residential mortgage loans at an average yield of 6.6% and an average credit quality of AA. Year-to-date, Blackstone has originated approximately $4.6 billion for us, totaling roughly $12.5 billion since the start of our strategic partnership in late 2021. Moving next to operating expenses. We reduced our operating expenses by 2% sequentially and 4% since the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by savings from our Corebridge Forward program, which are earning into our results. However, for 2023, they're being partially offset by incremental costs related to the establishment of our stand-alone and public company capabilities. In addition, we are incurring additional costs resulting from higher sales volumes as we look to staff up our insurance operations to service our growing portfolio. Now shifting to our segment results. Individual Retirement reported adjusted pretax operating income of $574 million for the second quarter, an increase of 57% year-over-year or 61% after excluding variable investment income. Approximately 75% of Individual Retirement's operating earnings are from fixed and fixed index annuity, while 25% are from variable annuity. Unpacking that last point a bit further. On average, over the last 12 months, Individual Retirement's variable annuity portfolio contributed only 12% to Corebridge's operating results. Base spread income rose 56% over the prior year quarter, driven by spread expansion and growth of our general account products, while base net investment spreads increased 81 basis points year-over-year and 10 basis points sequentially. Total net flows in individual retirements account remained positive, notwithstanding that surrenders are elevated across the industry due to higher interest rates. The pace of sequential increase for our fixed annuity surrender rate has begun to moderate. In addition, policyholder behavior is in line with our modeled lapse expectations given the current interest rate environment. Fee income declined by 7% due to ongoing net outflows in our variable annuity portfolio over the prior year. And lastly, our hedging program continues to protect the balance sheet as designed. Now turning to Group Retirement. Group Retirement reported adjusted pretax operating income of $197 million for the second quarter, an increase of 10% year-over-year or 22% after excluding variable investment income. While fee income was largely unchanged compared to the second quarter of 2022, base spread income rose 13% over the prior year, driven by spread expansion, partially offset by net outflows. Base net investment spread increased 23 basis points year-over-year and 3 basis points sequentially. Out-of-plan fixed and fixed index annuity sales grew over 200% year-over-year, while advisory and brokerage assets grew 14% during the same period. Together, they provide attractive full-service offerings for both in-plan participants and out-of-plan clients and are especially valuable in retention for our aging block of variable annuity business in the current high interest rate environment. As a reminder, advisory and brokerage net flows are not reported in Group Retirement net flows. Net outflows from the general account continued to be concentrated in high GMIR cohorts, which will help improve the general account economic return profile over time while we continue to grow our fee-based assets, including advisory and brokerage. As discussed during our first quarter earnings call, our open architecture mutual fund recordkeeping platform expects to see elevated outflows persist in the near term, driven by planned losses as sponsors increased the volume of plans being put out for bids in 2023. Planned acquisitions and losses are nonlinear and vary from quarter-to-quarter. At present, we project outflows will increase in the third quarter due to additional plan losses. These outflows generally have a lower impact on revenues and a limited impact on the general account. Now turning to Life. Life Insurance reported adjusted pretax operating income of $76 million for the second quarter, a decrease of 22% year-over-year or an increase of 46% after excluding variable investment income. Underwriting margin, excluding variable investment income, improved 4% year-over-year due to higher base portfolio income. Mortality experience, inclusive of reserve impact, was marginally favorable year-over-year. As Kevin mentioned, we have entered into a definitive agreement to sell Laya. The earnings from layer will continue to be reflected in the Life segment's adjusted pretax operating income until the sale is closed. Laya was expected to contribute approximately $30 million to this year's operating results. Now turning to Institutional Markets. Institutional Markets reported adjusted pretax operating income of $126 million for the second quarter, an increase of 66% year-over-year or 28% after excluding variable investment income. Core sources of income expanded 22% over the prior year quarter, largely due to higher base spread income and improved underwriting margin. Base spread income benefited from the higher new money yields as well as the cumulative growth of the portfolio. Reserves for our pension risk transfer business grew 49% year-over-year on an original discount rate basis, reflecting the strong growth in this business. And lastly, our Corporate and Other segment reported a loss of $137 million for the second quarter, the result of our stand-alone capital structure and new parent company expenses since the IPO. Now turning to commercial real estate. In our first quarter earnings call, we discussed commercial mortgage loans at length. The points we shared with you remain true today, and we continue to believe that our exposure is manageable. Our portfolio continues to be high quality, consisting of first lien, mostly fixed rate loans with strong credit fundamentals. It's carefully underwritten, closely monitored and conservatively reserved. And we are the lead lender on approximately 90% of the loans. We continue to maintain a strong bias towards multifamily and industrial sectors. As expected, valuation of commercial properties, especially those related to office, remain under pressure impacting loan-to-value ratios. While we did see some modest deterioration in the valuation over the second quarter, it was largely in line with our expectations. While we expect some credit deteriorations resulting from the current environment, given the strong fundamentals of our portfolio and our strong balance sheet, we continue to believe any dislocation in the commercial real estate sector will result in an earnings event and not a capital event. Wrapping up. Corebridge continues to be in a very strong capital position, enjoying significant financial flexibility. We continue to actively manage our balance sheet to maintain ample holding company liquidity, healthy levels of risk-based capital in our insurance subsidiaries and a reasonable financial leverage profile while delivering on our program to improve profitability and provide shareholders with an attractive return. We ended the second quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.6 billion, a decrease from $1.8 billion in the first quarter after returning $750 million to shareholders. Our insurance subsidiaries distributed $500 million during the second quarter, bringing the year-to-date distributions to $1 billion. And yesterday, we declared our dividend for the third quarter of 2023, which will be paid on September 29, bringing the cumulative amount of regular quarterly dividends paid since the IPO and inclusive of the third quarter dividend to approximately $750 million. Our second quarter light fleet RBC remains in line with the first quarter despite the higher volume of new business. At this time, we estimate the second quarter likely RBC to be in the range of 410% to 420%. Our adjusted book value per share was $36.44, an increase of 4% year-over-year or 2% sequentially. And our financial leverage ratio was 28%, which was well within our target range and provides adequate financial flexibility. In conclusion, our focused execution and the competitive strength of our diversified businesses and earnings sources drove excellent financial results this quarter. We returned $750 million of capital to shareholders, bringing the total capital return since the IPO to $1.2 billion. Our premiums and deposits were 42% higher than the prior year quarter. Base yield increased 76 basis points from a year ago. Aggregate core sources of income rose 18% year-over-year, supported by over 40% growth in base spread income. And we reduced our operating expenses 4% over the first half of the year. At the same time, our insurance companies continue to deliver strong operating results and solid cash flows, and we remain on track to deliver on our financial goals that we established at the time of the IPO. Now I will hand the call back to Kevin.\nKevin Hogan: Thank you, Elias, and operator, we're now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America.\nJosh Shanker: Looking at your capital needs and looking for the stock trades today, is there any sense that in strategy you want to utilize less capital on growth to be able to put more capital to work in returning capital to shareholders in the form of buybacks.\nKevin Hogan: Josh, thanks. I think the short answer is no. I mean our capital management philosophy is pretty clear. Our priority is to maintain a strong balance sheet to meet our financial goals and have the financial flexibility to invest in organic growth of the business so we can sustain those cash flows and grow those cash flows. And as we look at our overall capital and liquidity management, we do consider the quarterly dividend as part of our fixed cost. And the reality is, is we've been able to support strong growth and strong capital return while maintaining a very strong balance sheet. Our RBC, as Elias pointed out, is 410% to 420%. Our leverage is 28% within our target and our liquidity is also in a strong position. And we remain on track to the 60% to 65% payout ratio while supporting our growth. So we are very confident in our capital management strategy, and we remain disciplined in its execution.\nElias Habayeb: Yes. And Josh, if I may add one more thing. If you look at our track record, we do prioritize returns to shareholder, and a good example is what we did in the second quarter with the excess liquidity we find ourselves in where we provided a special dividend of $400 million.\nJosh Shanker: And on Group Retirement, given the surge in markets, is there a change of behavior in terms of the average retiree or average account in your portfolio about the degree of withdrawals that they might decide to keep their money returning at a higher accumulation phase or, I should say, a higher growth phase given where the markets are? Or it seems pretty steady in terms of behaviors on the individual account basis?\nKevin Hogan: Yes. Thanks, Josh. I think the way to think of Group Retirement is the in-plan versus the out-of-plan. And we are seeing comparable behavior in the out-of-plan area as what we\u2019re seeing in the individual businesses, where some people are taking the opportunity of the current environment to invest in attractive fixed annuity products. Our out-of-plan fixed annuity sales are up about 200% in that business, and we are seeing some increased outflows in the variable annuity out of plan. The dynamic that's going on in-plan is that in terms of large group sort of wins and also large group losses, during the pandemic, there was a modest amount of plan remarketing because plan sponsors really \u2013 it was difficult for them to engage in the exercise. And so we\u2019re now seeing plan remarketing return to sort of pre-pandemic levels. And because of these various dynamics, I mean the reality is we look beyond net flows in terms of what are the predictors of earnings in the Group Retirement business. Because when the outflows are in the group mutual fund area, those have a modest impact on earnings. When they\u2019re in the high guaranteed minimum interest rate area, which the \u2013 which is the weight of our outflows, those also have a modest contribution to the economic value. And when we see inflows in areas like the out-of-plan fixed annuities as well as our advisory and brokerage platform, which we don\u2019t include in net flows but was up 14% year-over-year, what we see is that the earnings based the economic quality of the in-force is actually improving.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ryan Krueger with KBW.\nRyan Krueger: Are there any tax offsets or other offsets to the Laya Health proceeds? Or should the deployable proceeds approximate the sale price?\nElias Habayeb: No. I think what you should be thinking, Ryan, in terms -- that's the gross sales price about the \u20ac650 million. There will be some taxes associated with it as well as some deal costs, but the \u20ac650 million is the gross price.\nRyan Krueger: Got it. And then could you discuss the decision to use those proceeds for a special dividend rather than incremental buybacks just given the low valuation of your stock at this point?\nKevin Hogan: Sure. Thanks, Ryan. This is a great transaction for Corebridge and for Corebridge shareholders. We identified sort of early on as part of our regular review of opportunities that because it is an MGA, this could be a relatively straightforward transaction. And the way that we execute it, I think, demonstrates that and has unlocked significant value. And our focus continues to be on executing on all the aspects of our strategy to deliver our financial targets and to have the financial flexibility to achieve that 60% to 65% payout ratio in 2024, and I think we\u2019ve demonstrated a lot of discipline. And as Elias mentioned, when we have excess capital beyond our plan, then that is where we take additional action. At every step, we will evaluate the options that make the most sense and how we return capital to shareholders and consultation with our Board and also taking into consideration AIG\u2019s plans. And so a special dividend is one means of returning capital to shareholders, and this position so far has been taken in consultation with our board.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.\nBrian Meredith: A couple of them quick here. First one, I'm just curious, Kevin, what other potential strategic actions other you talked about U.K. Life, you've got Laya Health being sold. Is there anything else in that portfolio that you potentially see strategic opportunities here going forward? Or is that kind of it?\nKevin Hogan: Yes. Thanks, Brian. Look, we regularly review our portfolio, and we're always looking for opportunities to unlock further value for our shareholders. And going back to the creation of Fortitude Re, frankly, I think we've demonstrated both our willingness and our capability to execute at large scale. And we're very pleased with the sale of Laya another example as to where we can unlock value. And our next focus is going to be U.K. Life. It's another very attractive platform. The management team has done a great job, and I think that there's a lot of interest already been expressed in the market for it. Our focus is on the large U.S. Life and retirement market. It's the largest and fastest growing market relative to where our strategy is. And we have important strategic advantages in the U.S., including scale as well as the support of important macro trends. But we always will look for opportunities to optimize the portfolio. Right now, our focus is on the transactions in hand and unlocking as much value in the sale of U.K. Life as we can.\nBrian Meredith: Great. And then second question, I'm just curious, given where new money yields are right now, I'm just curious, what could we see base spreads doing here in individual over the next, call it, 6 to 12 months? How should we think about the expansion there? And then on top of that, is there a limit to how much you think base spreads can actually go to?\nKevin Hogan: So the \u2013 where the spreads are going to be is obviously going to be dependent on where interest rates and credit spreads are, and we\u2019ve proven that we can deliver an improvement in spreads. I mean our Individual Retirement business is up 10 basis points sequentially and 81 basis points year-over-year. And Group is up 3 sequentially and 23 year-over-year. Will spreads continue to widen? We believe they will, but maybe not at the pace at which they have widened so far. And it really does depend on what the future environment is. I mean if rates stay about where they are, then those would flatten out. If rates continue to increase or credit spreads widen, we can see further improvement. But I believe the most important thing is that where the spreads are right now. They are very economically attractive. This new business that we\u2019re writing at these spreads are extremely attractive, and we\u2019re comfortable at this level. And even if rates were to go the other direction, we have the opportunity to respond. We\u2019ve locked in the yields on the business we\u2019ve written so far. And historically, we\u2019ve proven the ability to be successful in almost any macro environment.\nOperator: The next question comes from John Barnidge with Piper Sandler.\nJohn Barnidge: You talked about being in the U.S. markets, principally. As it relates to the Institutional Markets business, would pension risk transfer be limited to the U.S. markets? Or could that be global in nature?\nKevin Hogan: Yes. Thanks, John. I mean we consider the pension risk transfer business global in nature but leveraging our U.S. balance sheet, which gives us the opportunity for not only strength but further diversification. And our focus since 2016 has been on full plan terminations. And the market in the U.K. is a comparable size to the U.S. In many ways, it's a little bit more mature. And so we've established a position for ourselves as a reinsurer of U.K. transactions as well as the U.S. Those are the 2 biggest markets in the world. But to the extent we were able to identify additional opportunities that make sense for us to participate in, then we would explore those. I have to say the pipeline in the U.S. and the U.K. remain very strong. And from the outset, we believe that there is upside for us in the pension risk transfer part of the Institutional business alongside GICs. We've also said from the beginning that we have the opportunity to be a more regular issue of GICs as a separate and independent company. So we feel great about our position with the Institutional Markets business.\nJohn Barnidge: My follow-up question, if I may. Can you talk about your visibility into recovery of variable investment income?\nElias Habayeb: So yes, if you look about variable investment income, there\u2019s 2 components to that portfolio. One is tied to alternatives, and the second is tied to where liability management activity fees on commercial mortgage, prepayments as well as call and tender activity. So on the first one on alternatives, we continue to believe that long-term expectation is 8.5%. It\u2019s going to be market-driven. It\u2019s been depressed. But given what the recent performance is, there could be a recovery in that space. With respect to the other component of variable investment income, that\u2019s really going to depend on what happens to M&A activity and liability management exercise. So our view is what we\u2019ve experienced in the last few quarters sort of on the bottom end. What we experienced on 2021 is at the top end, and we do expect it to revert to somewhere in the middle at some point.\nOperator: The next question comes from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs.\nAlex Scott: First question I had is on individual retirement. Just looking at net flows on the surface, first quarter in a while, you've had outflows. Can you talk about the dynamic with surrender rates? I think you said they had moderate. Maybe just thoughts on as we sit here today with current rate levels, how much could that moderate. And what do you think is a reasonable level of fixed annuity flows in this kind of environment?\nKevin Hogan: Yes. Thanks, Alex. It is true that overall net flows in the Individual Retirement business were negative, but that is largely weighted in the separate accounts, which have a different dynamic relative to earnings contributions. And again, similar to Group Retirement, we kind of look beyond net flows at the sources of earnings. I think what's important is in the general account in Individual Retirement, we actually had $400 million of positive flows. And let's take a look at the second quarter in sort of perspective, right? I mean the premiums and deposits were nearly $10 billion, which is a very, very strong quarter for us. It's up 42% year-over-year. And frankly, one of the benefits of our business model with the multiple products and channels is that we don't have to rely on any one product or channel. And we mobilized our capital where the risk-adjusted returns are the most attractive. On the fixed annuity side, the first quarter sales of fixed annuity were remarkably high, and that was kind of an industry issue. You saw the whole industry was down 24% from the first quarter to the second quarter. And I think that reflects the nature of where interest rates and credit spreads were in the first quarter and pent-up demand, especially in the bank channels. We never really expected that level of activity to continue. In the second quarter, there's a lot of operational work to get through from the pipeline of the first quarter, and we also had very attractive opportunities. We knew in the pension risk transfer pipeline as well as continuing tremendous demand for the index annuity product. In terms of surrenders, they did creep up a little bit in the quarter, but they remain aligned with our expectations. We continue to see growth in the general account. And if interest rates stay about where they are, I think that the reality is, is that many of the advisers have been through their book over the last year of this higher interest rate environment. And a lot of the people that may have made reinvestment decisions have likely already initiated action. So as long as these surrenders remain within our expectation, that's what's most important to us. And I'll just reiterate that where the new business margins are right now, we're very comfortable with our position in Individual Retirements, including fixed annuities, which, as you know, has long been an important part of our strategy and continues to be.\nAlex Scott: That's really helpful. Second question is just in the Life Insurance business. We've heard from the industry this quarter, I wouldn't say concerns, but a little bit of pressure around older age mortality and just a pull forward of mortality still occurring. Would be interested if you're seeing any of that, if maybe there's dynamics between the portfolio you have versus maybe what the industry has and. Just thinking through, you did separate a fair amount of universal life going back to the Fortitude separation. So anything nuanced around your book of life in that industry theme?\nKevin Hogan: Well, Alex, we have repositioned our portfolio over the last number of years, as you pointed out. And we feel really good about the product suite that we now have. And our second quarter mortality actually showed a bit of improvement and continues to be within our pricing expectations. LDTI does help reduce some of the volatility that historically we saw, particularly in the term area. And so that may be something reflective of reporting, but we did see a modest improvement. We haven\u2019t seen any trends in mortality that suggests a change to our long-term assumptions. From the beginning of the pandemic, we did believe that there was likely going to be some acceleration of mortality. But the quality of the reporting and cause of death and those type of things make it very difficult to interpret. So we\u2019re now just looking at overall mortality, and we\u2019re comfortable where we are.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research.\nErik Bass: Are there any capital optimization opportunities that you can look at within the business, such as internal reinsurance that could potentially improve returns or capital efficiency over time?\nElias Habayeb: Erik, it's Elias. So from a capital perspective, we actively manage the balance sheet. And we always look for opportunities to how we optimize it, and we did something last year where we pulled our VA reserves and allow us to optimize capital, and that helped fund some of the new business we did. So this is something we do on a regular basis in how we manage our balance sheet.\nErik Bass: Okay. And then maybe just on Group Retirement. Can you talk a little bit about how much of the legacy business with high guaranteed minimum interest rates has either been repriced or lapsed at point? And kind of how much of your block you would still sort of put in that category of sort of less profitable, high GMIR business?\nKevin Hogan: Well, the high GMIR business is one of the older cohorts in the portfolio, and it remains an open block. I mean participants are able to continue to contribute to those in-plan options. So we've seen modest outflows in the block, but it hasn't changed materially in size over the last couple of years.\nErik Bass: Got it. Okay. I guess, I mean, putting it in context, I mean, the inflows, is it fair to think that the inflows that you're seeing coming in would be at higher returns? And it sounds like more of the outflows are coming from the legacy blocks. So the mix is shifting favorably, but there's still a relatively large portion that you'd call sort of the legacy block?\nElias Habayeb: That's right. So if you look at what's happening to base spreads, like even look sequentially, even though there's net outflows, the base spread is improving because the weighted average spread between what's on the in-force after you've taken what goes on and what comes in is expanding that spread. So that's kind of evidence to the improving economics you're seeing in that book.\nKevin Hogan: Yes. And actually, Erik, I mean you are thinking about it the right way. There\u2019s the in plan business. And where we\u2019re seeing inflows in, say, the 2% in lower GMIR, those are more attractive than the higher GMIR areas. But we also have to keep in mind the advisory and brokerage platform, which is outside of net flows and also the growth in the out-of-plan fixed annuities. Each of those are extremely economically attractive.\nOperator: The next question comes from Suneet Kamath with Jefferies.\nSuneet Kamath: Great. Just starting with the RBC ratio. I saw it was flat sequentially despite the strong sales, and I think you took out a $500 million dividend. So can you just maybe talk about some of the offsets that kept the RBC flat? And are you still looking at $2 billion in distributions to the holding company for this year?\nElias Habayeb: Suneet, it's Elias. So if you look at the historical track record, our insurance companies have distributed about $2 billion a year. And right now, based on what we know, that's sort of the expectation for this year. With respect to the offset, and there's new business. We get -- there's also capital being generated by the earnings of the in-force, and we benefit from the diversification on kind of our businesses and how we make money. In addition, we are always kind of looking to optimize our balance sheet from that perspective. But looking at it specifically to this quarter, yes, we've had new business strain come through. It's offset by the earnings of the in-force, and there was a small element of optimization on the investment portfolio. And I'd refer you there to my remarks where we've sold down below investment-grade securities, and we're down about $1 billion since December.\nSuneet Kamath: Yes, migration. That makes sense. I guess separately in your prepared remarks you talked...\nElias Habayeb: It's now migration. I would say most of the $1 billion were sales.\nSuneet Kamath : Right, right. At the shift in terms of the underlying ratings quality. But I got you. No problem. The other question I want to ask was on VA. You kind of said in your prepared remarks, you had some commentary there around the limited earnings contribution of that business. It does seem like it drags down your valuation to some degree. Would you be open to a risk transfer in that business, just given kind of the third-party valuations that we're seeing in the market?\nKevin Hogan: We're always looking for opportunities to optimize the portfolio. And what I'd say about the VA business, it is a modest part of our earnings. It has been in outflows. Right now, it is not among the most popular products from an investor perspective, mostly because of where rates are and where the equity markets are. If there were to be a change in that trend, then the VA product may become more popular. But in terms of optimization opportunities, we're constantly looking, and we are aware of market conditions. We prioritized Laya and U.K. Life, and we'll continue to look for further opportunities.\nElias Habayeb: And the other thing I would add to that is the reason we provided this data is VA is a shrinking component of our balance sheet and a shrinking component of our results. So I just want to \u2013 we haven\u2019t given that transparency before, and we want to give it now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI.\nTom Gallagher: Yes. Just a follow-up on the risk transfer. Just considering and isolating the MetLife deal, they got a 15x multiple, doing a combination of individual life and legacy fixed annuities. Now obviously, Corebridge has both of those. But I know you've already done the Fortitude Re deal. So there was already, we'll say, some optimization of more balance sheet intensive life insurance businesses that occurred already. Is that something that you'd consider from an optimization standpoint, those types of individual life and maybe even legacy fixed annuities? Is that something under consideration?\nElias Habayeb: Tom, it's Elias. So as Kevin said earlier, we're regularly looking at our balance sheet to find ways to optimize the balance sheet and unlock shareholder value. And if you take just the example of the Laya transaction, given the price we quoted that's been agreed to with the earnings that it contributes, I think we've got a great multiple on that transaction, and we've unlocked significant value with lower execution risk. So nothing is off the table for us. We are always looking at ways to unlock value for shareholders. Right now, we've prioritized the sales of Laya in the U.K. because, one, they're not core to us, and we believe they'll unlock significant value for our shareholders there. But we're always looking for ways to optimize.\nTom Gallagher: Okay. And then just a follow-up on the Group Retirement business. Elias, I know you had mentioned you expected lapses to increase in Q3 in that business. Can you unpack that a little bit? What's going on in the market now? Or is it the same competitors where that business is going? Competitively, what is happening in that market that's driving that? And I think you had mentioned that it's maybe large assets, but not large economics, and maybe further expansion on that.\nKevin Hogan: Yes. Thanks, Tom. The increase in the lapses really is related to the dynamic of large group wins and/or losses. And year-over-year, the large group wins and losses are not linear. In the second quarter, we didn\u2019t have any large group wins. In the first quarter, we did. In the second quarter of last year, we did. And at the same time, some of the large case surrenders actually contractually took effect in the second quarter. If you look at the outside of the large group wins and losses, we actually see incremental growth in the deposits in both the periodic and the nonperiodic areas. So there is sustained growth there, and that\u2019s important. But when we don\u2019t have wins and when we do have losses, that impacts the level of the net flows, and that\u2019s why we have to look beyond the net flows for the sources of earnings. There\u2019s no change per se, I don\u2019t think, in the competitive dynamic. We continue to be focused on plans that value the role of the adviser. We take a little more holistic approach. But there is more planned remarketing right now than there was, say, a year or 2 ago because a lot of the remarketing was restrained during the pandemic. And now we\u2019re seeing kind of a return to regular levels. But large wins and large losses are never going to be linear. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to look at the periodic and nonperiodic deposits.\nOperator: Those are all the questions we have time for today. So I'll turn the call back to the management team for any closing remarks.\nKevin Hogan: Okay. Thanks, everybody. Appreciate the questions. I hope you have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. This concludes our call, and you may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Elias Habayeb",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. This morning, I'll provide key highlights on our strong financial performance in the second quarter as well as provide an update on our balance sheet and capital management activities. Corebridge continues to make great progress delivering on its goals with favorable trends supporting the growth of spread products, especially in individual retirement and institutional markets. Earlier today, we reported earnings per share of $1.04, which was up 37% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. We also reported an adjusted ROE of 11.7% for the second quarter, which puts us at a run rate of approximately 12%. Adjusted pretax operating income was $836 million, an increase of $225 million compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding variable investment income, adjusted pretax operating income was 51% higher than the prior year quarter, largely due to higher base spread income, partially offset by interest expense on financial debt issued in the second and third quarters of 2022. Sequentially, our reported adjusted pretax operating income was $112 million higher than the first quarter due to improved base spread income and variable investment income as well as lower expenses. Our aggregate core sources of income increased by 18% year-over-year, driven by the growth of base spread income and underwriting margin, partially offset by the decline of fee income. Assets under management and administration ended the quarter at $372 billion, up 4% year-over-year or 1% sequentially. Turning to net investment income and our investment portfolio. Net investment income for our insurance subsidiaries on an adjusted pretax operating income basis was $2.5 billion, up 24% year-over-year or 8% sequentially. Our net investment income continues to reflect strong base portfolio income, offset by variable investment income below historical averages. Base portfolio income was $2.4 billion, up 27% year-over-year or 5% sequentially. The yield on our base asset portfolio was 4.6%, up 76 basis points year-over-year and 18 basis points sequentially, driven by a combination of reinvestment activity at higher new money yields and an increase in total invested assets. Total invested assets grew approximately $10 billion year-over-year or over $1 billion sequentially on a book basis. Average new money yields were over 6.6% in the second quarter, approximately 220 basis points higher than the average yield on assets rolling out of the portfolio. This is the fourth consecutive quarter with significant yield uplift. While we expect the favorable trend to continue based on current new money yields, the quantum of sequential improvement may slow down. Variable investment income was $96 million for the quarter, down 20% year-over-year or up 243% sequentially. On an annualized basis, our alternatives investment portfolio returned over 6% for the second quarter. Private equity and hedge fund returns were higher than the prior year quarter, while real estate equity returns were lower, reflecting the lack of material sales and the impact of cap rates on property valuations. Real estate equity currently comprises approximately 25% of our alternative investments. Our investment portfolio remains high quality, well diversified and actively managed. It's predominantly invested in fixed income assets, which comprise 97% of our portfolio, with the remaining 3% in alternative investments. Approximately 94% of our fixed maturity investments are rated investment grade as of the end of the quarter. We continue to direct new investments towards higher credit quality assets. This, together with net positive credit migration and ongoing derisking activities, improve the overall weighted average credit rating of our fixed maturity securities in the second quarter from a single A minus in the previous quarter to single A flat. Year-to-date, we reduced our below investment-grade exposure by approximately $1 billion, primarily due to targeted sales. Our recent purchases, including highly-rated structured products and private placements as well as residential mortgage loans and non-agency RMBS, these assets are well matched to the insurance liabilities we've been originating recently. Blackstone executed nearly $1.5 billion of new transactions for our general account during the second quarter, including private and structured credit as well as residential mortgage loans at an average yield of 6.6% and an average credit quality of AA. Year-to-date, Blackstone has originated approximately $4.6 billion for us, totaling roughly $12.5 billion since the start of our strategic partnership in late 2021. Moving next to operating expenses. We reduced our operating expenses by 2% sequentially and 4% since the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by savings from our Corebridge Forward program, which are earning into our results. However, for 2023, they're being partially offset by incremental costs related to the establishment of our stand-alone and public company capabilities. In addition, we are incurring additional costs resulting from higher sales volumes as we look to staff up our insurance operations to service our growing portfolio. Now shifting to our segment results. Individual Retirement reported adjusted pretax operating income of $574 million for the second quarter, an increase of 57% year-over-year or 61% after excluding variable investment income. Approximately 75% of Individual Retirement's operating earnings are from fixed and fixed index annuity, while 25% are from variable annuity. Unpacking that last point a bit further. On average, over the last 12 months, Individual Retirement's variable annuity portfolio contributed only 12% to Corebridge's operating results. Base spread income rose 56% over the prior year quarter, driven by spread expansion and growth of our general account products, while base net investment spreads increased 81 basis points year-over-year and 10 basis points sequentially. Total net flows in individual retirements account remained positive, notwithstanding that surrenders are elevated across the industry due to higher interest rates. The pace of sequential increase for our fixed annuity surrender rate has begun to moderate. In addition, policyholder behavior is in line with our modeled lapse expectations given the current interest rate environment. Fee income declined by 7% due to ongoing net outflows in our variable annuity portfolio over the prior year. And lastly, our hedging program continues to protect the balance sheet as designed. Now turning to Group Retirement. Group Retirement reported adjusted pretax operating income of $197 million for the second quarter, an increase of 10% year-over-year or 22% after excluding variable investment income. While fee income was largely unchanged compared to the second quarter of 2022, base spread income rose 13% over the prior year, driven by spread expansion, partially offset by net outflows. Base net investment spread increased 23 basis points year-over-year and 3 basis points sequentially. Out-of-plan fixed and fixed index annuity sales grew over 200% year-over-year, while advisory and brokerage assets grew 14% during the same period. Together, they provide attractive full-service offerings for both in-plan participants and out-of-plan clients and are especially valuable in retention for our aging block of variable annuity business in the current high interest rate environment. As a reminder, advisory and brokerage net flows are not reported in Group Retirement net flows. Net outflows from the general account continued to be concentrated in high GMIR cohorts, which will help improve the general account economic return profile over time while we continue to grow our fee-based assets, including advisory and brokerage. As discussed during our first quarter earnings call, our open architecture mutual fund recordkeeping platform expects to see elevated outflows persist in the near term, driven by planned losses as sponsors increased the volume of plans being put out for bids in 2023. Planned acquisitions and losses are nonlinear and vary from quarter-to-quarter. At present, we project outflows will increase in the third quarter due to additional plan losses. These outflows generally have a lower impact on revenues and a limited impact on the general account. Now turning to Life. Life Insurance reported adjusted pretax operating income of $76 million for the second quarter, a decrease of 22% year-over-year or an increase of 46% after excluding variable investment income. Underwriting margin, excluding variable investment income, improved 4% year-over-year due to higher base portfolio income. Mortality experience, inclusive of reserve impact, was marginally favorable year-over-year. As Kevin mentioned, we have entered into a definitive agreement to sell Laya. The earnings from layer will continue to be reflected in the Life segment's adjusted pretax operating income until the sale is closed. Laya was expected to contribute approximately $30 million to this year's operating results. Now turning to Institutional Markets. Institutional Markets reported adjusted pretax operating income of $126 million for the second quarter, an increase of 66% year-over-year or 28% after excluding variable investment income. Core sources of income expanded 22% over the prior year quarter, largely due to higher base spread income and improved underwriting margin. Base spread income benefited from the higher new money yields as well as the cumulative growth of the portfolio. Reserves for our pension risk transfer business grew 49% year-over-year on an original discount rate basis, reflecting the strong growth in this business. And lastly, our Corporate and Other segment reported a loss of $137 million for the second quarter, the result of our stand-alone capital structure and new parent company expenses since the IPO. Now turning to commercial real estate. In our first quarter earnings call, we discussed commercial mortgage loans at length. The points we shared with you remain true today, and we continue to believe that our exposure is manageable. Our portfolio continues to be high quality, consisting of first lien, mostly fixed rate loans with strong credit fundamentals. It's carefully underwritten, closely monitored and conservatively reserved. And we are the lead lender on approximately 90% of the loans. We continue to maintain a strong bias towards multifamily and industrial sectors. As expected, valuation of commercial properties, especially those related to office, remain under pressure impacting loan-to-value ratios. While we did see some modest deterioration in the valuation over the second quarter, it was largely in line with our expectations. While we expect some credit deteriorations resulting from the current environment, given the strong fundamentals of our portfolio and our strong balance sheet, we continue to believe any dislocation in the commercial real estate sector will result in an earnings event and not a capital event. Wrapping up. Corebridge continues to be in a very strong capital position, enjoying significant financial flexibility. We continue to actively manage our balance sheet to maintain ample holding company liquidity, healthy levels of risk-based capital in our insurance subsidiaries and a reasonable financial leverage profile while delivering on our program to improve profitability and provide shareholders with an attractive return. We ended the second quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.6 billion, a decrease from $1.8 billion in the first quarter after returning $750 million to shareholders. Our insurance subsidiaries distributed $500 million during the second quarter, bringing the year-to-date distributions to $1 billion. And yesterday, we declared our dividend for the third quarter of 2023, which will be paid on September 29, bringing the cumulative amount of regular quarterly dividends paid since the IPO and inclusive of the third quarter dividend to approximately $750 million. Our second quarter light fleet RBC remains in line with the first quarter despite the higher volume of new business. At this time, we estimate the second quarter likely RBC to be in the range of 410% to 420%. Our adjusted book value per share was $36.44, an increase of 4% year-over-year or 2% sequentially. And our financial leverage ratio was 28%, which was well within our target range and provides adequate financial flexibility. In conclusion, our focused execution and the competitive strength of our diversified businesses and earnings sources drove excellent financial results this quarter. We returned $750 million of capital to shareholders, bringing the total capital return since the IPO to $1.2 billion. Our premiums and deposits were 42% higher than the prior year quarter. Base yield increased 76 basis points from a year ago. Aggregate core sources of income rose 18% year-over-year, supported by over 40% growth in base spread income. And we reduced our operating expenses 4% over the first half of the year. At the same time, our insurance companies continue to deliver strong operating results and solid cash flows, and we remain on track to deliver on our financial goals that we established at the time of the IPO. Now I will hand the call back to Kevin. Yes. And Josh, if I may add one more thing. If you look at our track record, we do prioritize returns to shareholder, and a good example is what we did in the second quarter with the excess liquidity we find ourselves in where we provided a special dividend of $400 million. No. I think what you should be thinking, Ryan, in terms -- that's the gross sales price about the \u20ac650 million. There will be some taxes associated with it as well as some deal costs, but the \u20ac650 million is the gross price. So yes, if you look about variable investment income, there's 2 components to that portfolio. One is tied to alternatives, and the second is tied to where liability management activity fees on commercial mortgage, prepayments as well as call and tender activity. So on the first one on alternatives, we continue to believe that long-term expectation is 8.5%. It's going to be market-driven. It's been depressed. But given what the recent performance is, there could be a recovery in that space. With respect to the other component of variable investment income, that's really going to depend on what happens to M&A activity and liability management exercise. So our view is what we've experienced in the last few quarters sort of on the bottom end. What we experienced on 2021 is at the top end, and we do expect it to revert to somewhere in the middle at some point. Erik, it's Elias. So from a capital perspective, we actively manage the balance sheet. And we always look for opportunities to how we optimize it, and we did something last year where we pulled our VA reserves and allow us to optimize capital, and that helped fund some of the new business we did. So this is something we do on a regular basis in how we manage our balance sheet. That's right. So if you look at what's happening to base spreads, like even look sequentially, even though there's net outflows, the base spread is improving because the weighted average spread between what's on the in-force after you've taken what goes on and what comes in is expanding that spread. So that's kind of evidence to the improving economics you're seeing in that book. Suneet, it's Elias. So if you look at the historical track record, our insurance companies have distributed about $2 billion a year. And right now, based on what we know, that's sort of the expectation for this year. With respect to the offset, and there's new business. We get -- there's also capital being generated by the earnings of the in-force, and we benefit from the diversification on kind of our businesses and how we make money. In addition, we are always kind of looking to optimize our balance sheet from that perspective. But looking at it specifically to this quarter, yes, we've had new business strain come through. It's offset by the earnings of the in-force, and there was a small element of optimization on the investment portfolio. And I'd refer you there to my remarks where we've sold down below investment-grade securities, and we're down about $1 billion since December. It's now migration. I would say most of the $1 billion were sales. And the other thing I would add to that is the reason we provided this data is VA is a shrinking component of our balance sheet and a shrinking component of our results. So I just want to \u2013 we haven't given that transparency before, and we want to give it now. Tom, it's Elias. So as Kevin said earlier, we're regularly looking at our balance sheet to find ways to optimize the balance sheet and unlock shareholder value. And if you take just the example of the Laya transaction, given the price we quoted that's been agreed to with the earnings that it contributes, I think we've got a great multiple on that transaction, and we've unlocked significant value with lower execution risk. So nothing is off the table for us. We are always looking at ways to unlock value for shareholders. Right now, we've prioritized the sales of Laya in the U.K. because, one, they're not core to us, and we believe they'll unlock significant value for our shareholders there. But we're always looking for ways to optimize."

            "name": "Kevin Hogan",
            "content": "Thank you, Josh, and good morning, everyone. This was another excellent quarter for Corebridge. We continue to benefit from focused execution, disciplined risk management and the competitive strengths of our diversified businesses. During the second quarter, we returned $750 million to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, bringing the total capital return since our initial public offering to $1.2 billion. With this milestone, we are honoring our commitment to begin to return capital beyond regular quarterly dividends within 9 months of the IPO. We remain focused on our capital management strategies, and we are on track to achieve a 60% to 65% payout ratio in 2024. This morning, I will focus on our strong financial performance and provide an update on the progress we are making towards our key financial targets as well as our strategic and operational priorities. For the second quarter, Corebridge reported operating earnings per share of $1.04 with an adjusted return on average equity of 11.7%. This reflects strong results from our core businesses as we remain well positioned to capitalize on current market opportunities. Base spread income rose 42% year-over-year, benefiting from higher new money yields as well as the cumulative effect of ongoing strong growth in our spread-based products. Across our 4 businesses, we delivered robust sales, generating approximately $10 billion of premiums and deposits, 42% higher than the prior year quarter. Second quarter conditions remained attractive for spread-based products, and we produced another quarter of robust new business, most notably in pension risk transfer and fixed index annuity. In institutional markets, we executed $1.9 billion of pension risk transfers. Our pipeline is strong, and we have positioned ourselves well to support the growing demand for full plan terminations. We also issued over $900 million of guaranteed investment contracts. For individual retirement, we produced $2.3 billion of fixed index annuity sales, a record-setting quarter for us in this product category. Conditions remain very favorable for fixed index products, and we expect the strong customer value proposition to continue driving sales in this environment. With respect to fixed annuity, we continue to deliver strong sales, reaching nearly $1.3 billion. We balanced market opportunities with meeting the operational demands of this product in light of the volume of transactions associated with our record level first quarter. The market remains attractive, and we will continue to respond within the context of our entire product portfolio. As the second quarter demonstrated, one of the key strengths of Corebridge is the ability to operate across product lines and respond to market dynamics while continuing to pursue profitable organic growth where risk-adjusted returns are the greatest. Thinking about the second half of the year, we expect favorable conditions for spread-based products to continue. We will remain disciplined with our capital deployment, simultaneously balancing competitiveness with margins and operational demands. Before I move away from sales, I want to take a moment to recognize the significant contributions our distribution platform has made to our organic growth. Corebridge Financial distributors is our team of in-house professionals with strategic long-term relationships across all of our distribution partners, including banks, broker-dealers, general and independent agencies and independent marketing organizations. Corebridge Financial distributors has enabled us to build a leading distribution platform through a range of partnerships. In the second quarter, this team was responsible for delivering over $9 billion of our premiums and deposits. We believe the breadth of our product offerings and long history of partnerships strengthen our relationships and serve as the foundation for our success. Let me now shift to some other areas of strength for Corebridge. In the 9 months since our initial public offering, we have consistently focused on executing our strategic and operational priorities and achieving our financial targets. We have begun to deliver significant return of capital to shareholders, and we are on track to meet our targeted adjusted return on equity and payout ratio in 2024. We are also well on our way towards achieving the promised run rate savings from Corebridge Forward as we have discussed on previous calls, and we are making consistent progress in our operational separation from AIG. Our actions over the last several quarters demonstrate the confidence we have in our balance sheet and the strength of our cash flows. Yesterday, we declared our fifth consecutive quarterly dividend of $0.23 per share. With this dividend, we will have returned over $1.35 billion in capital to shareholders since our IPO. This includes regular quarterly cash dividends totaling approximately $750 million, along with a special dividend in June of just over $400 million. Also in June, we repurchased $200 million of shares from AIG and Blackstone. This leaves us with $800 million remaining from the initial $1 billion share repurchase authorization we announced in May. Shifting to return on equity. Our run rate ROE for the first half of 2023 was approximately 12%. At the time of our IPO, our run rate was about 10%. This improvement was driven in large part by strong organic growth and improving base spread income. Looking ahead, we believe we are on a firm trajectory to achieve a 12% to 14% ROE in 2024, in line with one of the key financial targets we laid out when we launched Corebridge. With regards to Corebridge Forward, our modernization program that will deliver both expense reduction and increased efficiency, we have accelerated timing wherever possible and remain ahead of plan, having achieved or contracted on 75% of our exit run rate savings goal of $400 million. Thus far, we have largely completed the initiatives related to refining our target operating model and expanding our outsourcing with existing partners. The bulk of the remaining work is focused on modernizing our IT infrastructure and rationalizing our real estate footprint, which is expected to be complete in 2024. The last leg of our incremental cost savings will be driven by significant milestones and will not be linear. Above all, we remain confident that Corebridge Forward will be completed on time and that the majority of the run rate savings will be achieved within 24 months of our IPO. And we are on track with our operational separation from AIG. Given the progress we have made establishing our stand-alone capabilities as a publicly-traded company, the majority of our remaining work will be on the separation of shared IT applications, which we continue to believe will be mostly complete in 2023 with some work extending into 2024. Turning to other strategic actions. You saw in our announcement yesterday that we've agreed to sell our health insurance business in Ireland, Laya Healthcare, to AXA for \u20ac650 million, unlocking significant value for our shareholders. We expect the transaction will close in the fourth quarter subject to regulatory approvals. As noted on AIG's earnings call, we expect proceeds from this transaction will largely be used for a special dividend to Corebridge shareholders. Additionally, as also mentioned during AIG's earnings call, we recently retained advisers to analyze strategic alternatives for the disposition of our U.K. Life business. The dispositions of Laya and U.K. Life will streamline our portfolio and allow us to focus on life and retirement products and solutions in the United States. In conclusion, I am very pleased with our performance in the second quarter. Our broad product platform, diverse sources of earnings and very strong network of distribution partners stand as important strategic advantages for Corebridge and position us well to perform in different market environments. We continue to see favorable operating trends driving an increase in aggregate core sources of income. We are executing our strategic initiatives and believe the strength of our franchise and balance sheet will enable us to continue to create value for our shareholders. We are delivering on our commitment to return attractive levels of capital beyond regular quarterly dividends, and we are on pace to achieve a 60% to 65% payout ratio as well as a 12% to 14% return on equity in 2024. Now I will turn the call over to Elias. Thank you, Elias, and operator, we're now ready to take questions. Josh, thanks. I think the short answer is no. I mean our capital management philosophy is pretty clear. Our priority is to maintain a strong balance sheet to meet our financial goals and have the financial flexibility to invest in organic growth of the business so we can sustain those cash flows and grow those cash flows. And as we look at our overall capital and liquidity management, we do consider the quarterly dividend as part of our fixed cost. And the reality is, is we've been able to support strong growth and strong capital return while maintaining a very strong balance sheet. Our RBC, as Elias pointed out, is 410% to 420%. Our leverage is 28% within our target and our liquidity is also in a strong position. And we remain on track to the 60% to 65% payout ratio while supporting our growth. So we are very confident in our capital management strategy, and we remain disciplined in its execution. Yes. Thanks, Josh. I think the way to think of Group Retirement is the in-plan versus the out-of-plan. And we are seeing comparable behavior in the out-of-plan area as what we're seeing in the individual businesses, where some people are taking the opportunity of the current environment to invest in attractive fixed annuity products. Our out-of-plan fixed annuity sales are up about 200% in that business, and we are seeing some increased outflows in the variable annuity out of plan. The dynamic that's going on in-plan is that in terms of large group sort of wins and also large group losses, during the pandemic, there was a modest amount of plan remarketing because plan sponsors really \u2013 it was difficult for them to engage in the exercise. And so we're now seeing plan remarketing return to sort of pre-pandemic levels. And because of these various dynamics, I mean the reality is we look beyond net flows in terms of what are the predictors of earnings in the Group Retirement business. Because when the outflows are in the group mutual fund area, those have a modest impact on earnings. When they're in the high guaranteed minimum interest rate area, which the \u2013 which is the weight of our outflows, those also have a modest contribution to the economic value. And when we see inflows in areas like the out-of-plan fixed annuities as well as our advisory and brokerage platform, which we don't include in net flows but was up 14% year-over-year, what we see is that the earnings based the economic quality of the in-force is actually improving. Sure. Thanks, Ryan. This is a great transaction for Corebridge and for Corebridge shareholders. We identified sort of early on as part of our regular review of opportunities that because it is an MGA, this could be a relatively straightforward transaction. And the way that we execute it, I think, demonstrates that and has unlocked significant value. And our focus continues to be on executing on all the aspects of our strategy to deliver our financial targets and to have the financial flexibility to achieve that 60% to 65% payout ratio in 2024, and I think we've demonstrated a lot of discipline. And as Elias mentioned, when we have excess capital beyond our plan, then that is where we take additional action. At every step, we will evaluate the options that make the most sense and how we return capital to shareholders and consultation with our Board and also taking into consideration AIG's plans. And so a special dividend is one means of returning capital to shareholders, and this position so far has been taken in consultation with our board. Yes. Thanks, Brian. Look, we regularly review our portfolio, and we're always looking for opportunities to unlock further value for our shareholders. And going back to the creation of Fortitude Re, frankly, I think we've demonstrated both our willingness and our capability to execute at large scale. And we're very pleased with the sale of Laya another example as to where we can unlock value. And our next focus is going to be U.K. Life. It's another very attractive platform. The management team has done a great job, and I think that there's a lot of interest already been expressed in the market for it. Our focus is on the large U.S. Life and retirement market. It's the largest and fastest growing market relative to where our strategy is. And we have important strategic advantages in the U.S., including scale as well as the support of important macro trends. But we always will look for opportunities to optimize the portfolio. Right now, our focus is on the transactions in hand and unlocking as much value in the sale of U.K. Life as we can. So the \u2013 where the spreads are going to be is obviously going to be dependent on where interest rates and credit spreads are, and we've proven that we can deliver an improvement in spreads. I mean our Individual Retirement business is up 10 basis points sequentially and 81 basis points year-over-year. And Group is up 3 sequentially and 23 year-over-year. Will spreads continue to widen? We believe they will, but maybe not at the pace at which they have widened so far. And it really does depend on what the future environment is. I mean if rates stay about where they are, then those would flatten out. If rates continue to increase or credit spreads widen, we can see further improvement. But I believe the most important thing is that where the spreads are right now. They are very economically attractive. This new business that we're writing at these spreads are extremely attractive, and we're comfortable at this level. And even if rates were to go the other direction, we have the opportunity to respond. We've locked in the yields on the business we've written so far. And historically, we've proven the ability to be successful in almost any macro environment. Yes. Thanks, John. I mean we consider the pension risk transfer business global in nature but leveraging our U.S. balance sheet, which gives us the opportunity for not only strength but further diversification. And our focus since 2016 has been on full plan terminations. And the market in the U.K. is a comparable size to the U.S. In many ways, it's a little bit more mature. And so we've established a position for ourselves as a reinsurer of U.K. transactions as well as the U.S. Those are the 2 biggest markets in the world. But to the extent we were able to identify additional opportunities that make sense for us to participate in, then we would explore those. I have to say the pipeline in the U.S. and the U.K. remain very strong. And from the outset, we believe that there is upside for us in the pension risk transfer part of the Institutional business alongside GICs. We've also said from the beginning that we have the opportunity to be a more regular issue of GICs as a separate and independent company. So we feel great about our position with the Institutional Markets business. Yes. Thanks, Alex. It is true that overall net flows in the Individual Retirement business were negative, but that is largely weighted in the separate accounts, which have a different dynamic relative to earnings contributions. And again, similar to Group Retirement, we kind of look beyond net flows at the sources of earnings. I think what's important is in the general account in Individual Retirement, we actually had $400 million of positive flows. And let's take a look at the second quarter in sort of perspective, right? I mean the premiums and deposits were nearly $10 billion, which is a very, very strong quarter for us. It's up 42% year-over-year. And frankly, one of the benefits of our business model with the multiple products and channels is that we don't have to rely on any one product or channel. And we mobilized our capital where the risk-adjusted returns are the most attractive. On the fixed annuity side, the first quarter sales of fixed annuity were remarkably high, and that was kind of an industry issue. You saw the whole industry was down 24% from the first quarter to the second quarter. And I think that reflects the nature of where interest rates and credit spreads were in the first quarter and pent-up demand, especially in the bank channels. We never really expected that level of activity to continue. In the second quarter, there's a lot of operational work to get through from the pipeline of the first quarter, and we also had very attractive opportunities. We knew in the pension risk transfer pipeline as well as continuing tremendous demand for the index annuity product. In terms of surrenders, they did creep up a little bit in the quarter, but they remain aligned with our expectations. We continue to see growth in the general account. And if interest rates stay about where they are, I think that the reality is, is that many of the advisers have been through their book over the last year of this higher interest rate environment. And a lot of the people that may have made reinvestment decisions have likely already initiated action. So as long as these surrenders remain within our expectation, that's what's most important to us. And I'll just reiterate that where the new business margins are right now, we're very comfortable with our position in Individual Retirements, including fixed annuities, which, as you know, has long been an important part of our strategy and continues to be. Well, Alex, we have repositioned our portfolio over the last number of years, as you pointed out. And we feel really good about the product suite that we now have. And our second quarter mortality actually showed a bit of improvement and continues to be within our pricing expectations. LDTI does help reduce some of the volatility that historically we saw, particularly in the term area. And so that may be something reflective of reporting, but we did see a modest improvement. We haven't seen any trends in mortality that suggests a change to our long-term assumptions. From the beginning of the pandemic, we did believe that there was likely going to be some acceleration of mortality. But the quality of the reporting and cause of death and those type of things make it very difficult to interpret. So we're now just looking at overall mortality, and we're comfortable where we are. Well, the high GMIR business is one of the older cohorts in the portfolio, and it remains an open block. I mean participants are able to continue to contribute to those in-plan options. So we've seen modest outflows in the block, but it hasn't changed materially in size over the last couple of years. Yes. And actually, Erik, I mean you are thinking about it the right way. There's the in plan business. And where we're seeing inflows in, say, the 2% in lower GMIR, those are more attractive than the higher GMIR areas. But we also have to keep in mind the advisory and brokerage platform, which is outside of net flows and also the growth in the out-of-plan fixed annuities. Each of those are extremely economically attractive. We're always looking for opportunities to optimize the portfolio. And what I'd say about the VA business, it is a modest part of our earnings. It has been in outflows. Right now, it is not among the most popular products from an investor perspective, mostly because of where rates are and where the equity markets are. If there were to be a change in that trend, then the VA product may become more popular. But in terms of optimization opportunities, we're constantly looking, and we are aware of market conditions. We prioritized Laya and U.K. Life, and we'll continue to look for further opportunities. Yes. Thanks, Tom. The increase in the lapses really is related to the dynamic of large group wins and/or losses. And year-over-year, the large group wins and losses are not linear. In the second quarter, we didn't have any large group wins. In the first quarter, we did. In the second quarter of last year, we did. And at the same time, some of the large case surrenders actually contractually took effect in the second quarter. If you look at the outside of the large group wins and losses, we actually see incremental growth in the deposits in both the periodic and the nonperiodic areas. So there is sustained growth there, and that's important. But when we don't have wins and when we do have losses, that impacts the level of the net flows, and that's why we have to look beyond the net flows for the sources of earnings. There's no change per se, I don't think, in the competitive dynamic. We continue to be focused on plans that value the role of the adviser. We take a little more holistic approach. But there is more planned remarketing right now than there was, say, a year or 2 ago because a lot of the remarketing was restrained during the pandemic. And now we're seeing kind of a return to regular levels. But large wins and large losses are never going to be linear. So that's why it's important to look at the periodic and nonperiodic deposits. Okay. Thanks, everybody. Appreciate the questions. I hope you have a great day."

[Operator Instructions] I will now hand you over to your host, Josh Smith, Head of Investor Relations, to begin. Please go ahead.\nJosh Smith: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Corebridge Financial\u2019s earnings update for the first quarter of 2023. Joining me on the call are Kevin Hogan, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Elias Habayeb, Chief Financial Officer. We will begin with prepared remarks by Kevin and Elias, and then we will take your questions. As a reminder, our financial results reflect the implementation of long-duration targeted improvement accounting guidance or LDTI.

With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Kevin.\nA - Kevin Hogan: Thank you, Josh, and good morning, everyone. Corebridge is off to a very good start in 2023, having delivered another excellent quarter. Our businesses generated great results, and we continue to make advances on our strategic initiatives. Today, I will update you on the progress we are making towards our financial goals, including an important development in our capital management program. I will also speak to our business performance and strategic initiatives, concluding with comments on our disciplined approach to risk management and high-quality investment portfolio. Elias will then provide additional detail on our financial results and a deep dive into our commercial real estate portfolio. As we have said before, Corebridge Financial is committed to deploying capital to create value for our shareholders. Since our IPO, we have returned approximately $450 million in dividends to our shareholders. And today, we announced our fourth consecutive quarterly dividend of $0.23 per share, totaling approximately $150 million. We have been working to complement our dividend program with additional return of capital. And last week, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $1 billion. This share repurchase program is a reflection of our confidence in the strength of our financial position as we balance investments in long-term growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet with ample levels of liquidity and capital. It is an important step towards our ultimate goal of providing an attractive return for shareholders. Now turning to our results. We delivered earnings per share of $0.97 with adjusted return on average equity of 10.8% and adjusted pre-tax operating income of $724 million. Corebridge\u2019s business is positioned to perform across various market cycles. This quarter demonstrates once more that we can consistently deliver strong results across our diversified businesses. Adjusting for variable investment income, which was impacted by capital markets dislocation, the earnings power of our insurance businesses improved year-over-year. Tailwinds from higher interest rates, wider credit spreads and favorable mortality experience more than offset headwinds from equity market performance. This was the second consecutive quarter, our aggregate core sources of income grew by 15% on a year-over-year basis. Base spread income grew 38% compared to the prior year, due in part to higher new money rates and continuing growth in spread-based products. This quarter, we delivered very strong sales with attractive margins, generating higher general account cash flows. Across our four lines of business, we generated total premiums and deposits of $10.3 billion, up 45% compared to the prior year. The largest drivers of new deposits in the current quarter were $2.2 billion of fixed annuity sales and $2.1 billion of fixed index annuity sales and individual retirement. In addition, we delivered $1.5 billion in Pension Risk Transfer and $500 million in GIC issuance, both in Institutional Markets. The higher interest rates that have been driving our strong retail spread-based products over the last few quarters are as expected, also leading to higher levels of fixed annuity surrenders. That said, sales growth continues to outpace surrenders in our Individual Retirement business. For the quarter, general account net flows from Individual Retirement were positive at nearly $1.3 billion, up from approximately $700 million last quarter, despite an increase in surrender rates. In addition, liquidity in our insurance companies remain strong, and we continue to maintain a tight ALM profile. While delivering these excellent business results, we also advanced our key strategic initiatives, namely investment partnerships, Corebridge Forward and operational separation from AIG. Let me spend a moment on all three. We continue to see great value from our growing relationships with Blackstone and BlackRock. Our partnership with Blackstone is delivering for our company, our partners and our customers. In the first quarter, Blackstone executed approximately $3 billion of new investments across a variety of asset classes at an average gross yield of 6.5% and average credit quality of AA. Since the beginning of our partnership, Blackstone has invested approximately $11 billion on our behalf, giving us greater access to certain asset classes that are well matched to the insurance liabilities we originate. With respect to BlackRock, they executed on nearly $1 billion in new investments during the first quarter, some of which supported our Institutional Markets businesses. Turning to Corebridge Forward, our modernization program that will deliver both expense reduction and increased efficiency, we continue to advance this strategic initiative, having achieved or contracted on 70% of our exit run rate savings goal of $400 million. And lastly, we remain on track with our operational separation from AIG. Given the progress we have made in establishing our capabilities as a publicly traded company, the bulk of what remains is focused on the separation of shared IT applications, which we expect will be mostly complete in 2023. To date, we have incurred approximately $230 million of costs associated with our separation efforts. In addition to these initiatives, we continually assess our business portfolio as we position Corebridge for the future as a fully standalone company. After a comprehensive review, as announced last week on AIG\u2019s earnings call, we decided to evaluate strategic alternatives and a potential sale of our health insurance business in Ireland, which is distributed through the Laya Healthcare MGA and underwritten by a third-party. We believe this will help streamline the Corebridge portfolio and allow us to focus on Life & Retirement products and solutions. Before I address our investment portfolio, I want to begin with a few words on risk management, which is integral to how we manage Corebridge. We have a disciplined risk management framework focused on both sides of the balance sheet. This prepares us for a range of environments, including periods of market dislocation like we saw in the first quarter. We are heavily focused on ALM, which is embedded in how we manage the balance sheet. And our broad enterprise-wide thinking around risk includes liquidity, credit risk and capital management as well as periodic stress testing. On the liability side, risk management involves our broad product portfolio, intelligent product design and dynamic product management. On the asset side, risk management includes an investment portfolio that is aligned with our risk appetite and well matched to our liabilities. Elias will speak in more detail on our investment portfolio, but I want to share a few highlights. We have a high-quality and well-diversified investment portfolio that is predominantly concentrated in investment-grade fixed income assets. We strive to achieve strong risk-adjusted returns while matching the duration and liquidity needs of our liabilities. We derisked the portfolio over the last several years and we are comfortable with our exposure to commercial real estate. Our commercial mortgage loans are senior-secured on high-quality properties that are well diversified by type and geography with strong debt service coverage and LTV ratios in addition to adequate reserves. As a long-term investor with a strong balance sheet, Corebridge is not only well positioned to weather periods of market dislocation, but also able to capture new opportunities as they arise, all while maintaining our disciplined approach to ALM and credit risk management. We proactively manage risk in the portfolio based on our expectations of the future compared to market opportunities. As an example, with the relative strength of the capital markets early in the year, we took further action to derisk our portfolio. We intentionally reduced our exposure to below investment-grade corporate bonds and as a result, upgraded the quality of the portfolio, improved yields and increased liquidity, all with immaterial impact to our interest maintenance reserve. Our positive IMR remains a very healthy $2 billion even after these trades. In addition, during the first quarter, we sold our CLO manager, further simplifying our exposures. In summary, we take great pride in our disciplined risk management, which has safeguarded our operations over time and prepares us to weather many different economic cycles. We remain steadfast on our course in the face of recent events and general market uncertainty. As we look ahead, we remain focused on pursuing our strategic initiatives and financial goals, fulfilling the commitments we made in connection with our IPO and creating sustainable long-term value for all our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Elias.\nElias Habayeb: Thank you, Kevin. I will provide additional information on our financial results and key performance metrics as well as comment on our investment portfolio, including office exposure within the commercial mortgage loan portfolio. But first, I\u2019d like to make a couple of comments on LDTI. Last week, we released our restated 2021 and 2022 results for LDTI. As we previously said, we expect LDTI to reduce volatility in our operating results by minimizing the impact from variability in market conditions and mortality experience. At the same time, LDTI increased our adjusted book value as of December 31, 2022 by approximately $2 billion to $23.4 billion. That being said, LDTI does not impact the economics of our business nor our statutory capital and cash flows. Turning to our financial results. As Kevin noted, we had strong first quarter results driven by growing base spread income. Our operating EPS was $0.97, our adjusted ROE was 10.8%, and our adjusted pre-tax operating income was $724 million. This includes a notable item that contributed $0.06 to EPS and was offset by alternative investment returns below our long-term expectations by $0.14. Adjusting for these items, our operating EPS for the quarter would have been $1.05. In addition, our adjusted ROE would have exceeded 11% even with the higher adjusted book value from LDTI. This demonstrates the progress we\u2019re making towards achieving our target of 12% to 14% in 2024. With respect to adjusted pre-tax operating income, our results were $185 million below the prior year due to lower variable investment income, which accounted for over $270 million of the decline as well as $70 million of additional interest expense resulting from financial debt issued in the second and third quarters of 2022. Excluding variable investment income, adjusted pre-tax operating income was 14% higher than the first quarter of 2022, largely due to increasing base spread income and improved mortality experience. Sequentially, our reported adjusted pre-tax operating income was $20 million higher than the fourth quarter. Excluding variable investment income, adjusted pre-tax operating income was 2% higher, largely due to increasing base spread income, partially offset by $43 million of favorable non-recurring items in the fourth quarter. Our core sources of income in aggregate increased by 15%, driven by growth in base spread income and improvement in underwriting margins, partially offset by lower fee income. Shifting to net investment income. Base yield was 4.42% in the fourth quarter, up 60 basis points year-on-year. This was the third consecutive quarter of significant growth, driven by a combination of reinvestment activity at higher new money rates and resets on floating rate assets as well as an increase in total invested assets. Average new money yields were 6.5% in the fourth quarter, which was approximately 230 basis points higher than the average yield on assets rolling out of our portfolio. Stripping out the notable item in base net investment income from last quarter, base yields improved 15 basis points on a sequential basis. In aggregate, this improvement far outweighed any increase in policyholder crediting rates. Moving to expenses. Our GOE declined 2% sequentially. The benefits of the Corebridge Forward savings earning in were offset by incremental costs related to our establishment of our standalone capabilities as well as regular first quarter seasonality and compensation expense. Next, I will speak briefly about our segment results. Individual Retirement reported adjusted pre-tax operating income of $534 million for the quarter, an increase of 14% year-over-year or an increase of 55% after excluding variable investment income. Base spread income rose 49% over the prior year, driven by spread expansion and growth in general account products, while base net investment spreads increased 71 basis points year-over-year and 17 basis points sequentially. Fee income declined by 10% due to lower asset valuations and net outflows in our variable annuity portfolio. Fee income was flat relative to the fourth quarter, reflecting stabilization in asset values. As Kevin mentioned, general account net flows were positive at nearly $1.3 billion, up from approximately $700 million last quarter, despite an increase in surrender rates. Group Retirement reported adjusted pre-tax operating income of $186 million for the quarter, a decrease of 23% year-over-year or an increase of 7% after excluding variable investment income. Base spread income grew 20% from the first quarter of 2022 due to spread expansion, while fee income declined 12% year-over-year due to lower asset valuations and net outflows. Base net investment spread increased 24 basis points year-over-year, but decreased 7 basis points sequentially. The sequential quarter decline is driven by 10 basis points rise in cost of funds, largely attributed to out-of-plan fixed annuity product growth and higher crediting rates based on annual resets to certain in-force products. This more than offset the sequential increase in base yield. Consistent with previous quarters, we continue to see outflows concentrated in the higher GMIR buckets. We expect this trend to improve the profitability of the business over time. Looking at projections for next quarter, we expect net flows will \u2013 net outflows will increase due to additional planned losses, but with limited impact to the general account. As a reminder, plan acquisitions and losses are nonlinear and vary from quarter-to-quarter. Also, we\u2019re seeing a general pickup in plan activity, both acquisitions and losses as COVID moves from pandemic to endemic and plan sponsors are more willing to put plans out a bit. Life Insurance reported adjusted pre-tax operating income of $82 million for the quarter, a decrease of 2% year-over-year or an increase of 148% after excluding variable investment income. Underwriting margin, excluding variable investment income, improved 11% year-over-year due to improved mortality experience and higher base portfolio income. With the adoption of LDTI, variability in operating earnings for traditional life products like term is muted given that actual mortality experience will be largely offset by reserve releases in any single period. However, that\u2019s not the case for universal life as the accounting is not impacted by LDTI and where our experience was favorable in the first quarter. Institutional Markets reported adjusted pre-tax operating income of $85 million for the quarter, a decrease of 26% year-over-year or an increase of 3% after excluding variable investment income. Core sources of income expanded 7% over the prior year, largely due to base spread income, while reserves for our Pension Risk Transfer business grew 33% year-over-year on an original discount basis. And lastly, our Corporate and Other segment reported a loss of $163 million for the quarter. This loss is largely consistent with our expectations given new parent company expenses as well as our standalone capital structure. I will now provide some comments about our balance sheet, liquidity and capital. We assess our balance sheet through different lenses, including but not limited to, financial leverage, liquidity, capital and the overall risk profile. By each of these measures, our balance sheet is very healthy and strong. Adjusted book value was $23.3 billion or $35.88 per share, up 4% year-over-year, but down 1% from the fourth quarter. The sequential decline was due to non-operating mark-to-market losses. Our financial leverage ratio was 27.9%, which is well within our target range. We continue to expect that our balance sheet will naturally delever over time as a result of book value growth. And as a reminder, the next debt maturity is in 2025. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of $1.8 billion, an increase from $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Our insurance companies distributed $500 million during the first quarter. And as Kevin noted, we paid dividends to our shareholders of approximately $150 million, bringing the total paid to shareholders since the IPO to approximately $450 million. We declared our dividend for the second quarter of 2023, which will be paid on June 30. Our Life Fleet RBC ratio remains very strong. We estimate our first quarter Life Fleet RBC ratio to be in the range of 410% to 420% and exceeding our year-end RBC ratio of 411%. Next, I will spend a few minutes talking about our investment portfolio. Corebridge has a high-quality, well-diversified investment portfolio that\u2019s actively managed. Portfolio construction is backed by rigorous underwriting, monitoring and credit risk management processes designed to protect and optimize the balance sheet. The GAAP-carrying value of our general account investment portfolio was $193 billion as of March 31, 2023. Approximately 94% of our fixed income investments were rated investment grade. Our NAIC 3 to 6 investments were $8.4 billion, a figure that\u2019s approximately $600 million lower than the end of 2022, in part due to the derisking actions that Kevin described earlier. Now turning to commercial mortgage loans. Like our broader investment strategy, our commercial mortgage loan portfolio is high-quality, well-diversified and actively managed to support our insurance liabilities. It\u2019s backed by a disciplined and rigorous approach to underwriting and risk management. In addition, the valuations of the underlying properties are updated on an annual basis. As of March 31, our portfolio was $30.3 billion, making up 16% of total invested assets. These loans are primarily highly rated, longer-dated, fixed-rate first-lien loans with low LTVs and strong debt service coverage ratios. Each loan is carefully underwritten with embedded covenant protections. Our portfolio is diversified by both geography and sector, with nearly 60% of the portfolio comprised of multifamily and industrial property, reflecting our strong bias to these sectors over the last decade. Commercial mortgage loans secured by office properties were $7.7 billion or 4% of total invested assets as of March 31. These loans are also high-quality, carefully underwritten and covenant-heavy with strong credit characteristics. Over the past several years, we\u2019ve been actively reducing our exposure to office and emphasizing multifamily, industrial and other nontraditional office sectors as well as properties in Europe. As part of this evolving view, our exposure to traditional U.S. office is down from its peak. The traditional U.S. office portfolio component was $4.5 billion as of March 31, which is approximately 2% of our total invested assets. The remainder of the portfolio is in life sciences, mixed-use properties and ground leases as well as international office properties where the fundamentals are stronger than in the U.S. Our office portfolio enjoys strong credit metrics, which are as follows: it\u2019s highly rated with 94% of our loans designated CM1 or CM2. It\u2019s high-quality with almost 80% of the property consisting of Class A properties in major metropolitan areas and concentrated in central business districts. The weighted average loan-to-value is 63% and the weighted average debt service coverage ratio is over 2 times. It has strong occupancy ratios in the mid-80s. 80% of the fixed loan \u2013 of the loans are fixed rate. It has longer-dated loans with a weighted average remaining term of 7.5 years and only two loans are delinquent together carrying an outstanding balance of $8 million. Over our history, we have from time to time originated large loans where we felt very comfortable with the fundamentals, sponsor and location. Within our traditional U.S. office portfolio, we have three loans in excess of $200 million, all originated prior to 2019. The office properties are very building-specific, so it\u2019s crucial to evaluate each property carefully, no matter the size of the loan. We have approximately $1.2 billion of loans secured by traditional U.S. office properties with final maturity dates in 2023 and 2024, a figure that represents less than 1% of our total invested assets. Of that $1.2 billion, approximately $870 million have a final maturity date in 2023. As of May 4, we have resolved almost half of the 2023 maturities through either payoffs or extensions. Our traditional U.S. office exposure within New York City, where we have longer dated \u2013 longer tenure loans with solid debt service coverage ratios and strong occupancies is about 1% of total invested assets. Of the $870 million maturities for 2023, approximately $600 million are in New York City. One-third of these have already been resolved through either payoffs or extensions and the remaining properties underlying the [2023] maturities have extremely strong fundamentals and occupancy rates over 90%. As part of our standard monitoring process for any commercial mortgage loans, we proactively engage with borrowers regarding their refinancing plans well in advance of maturity. As a result, before this quarter began, we were already conducting routine surveillance on our upcoming maturities. On the extensions we\u2019ve agreed to so far, we\u2019ve been successful in getting a combination of various structural and capital enhancements. We are a lead lender in approximately 87% of our office originations, which affords us control over negotiations with borrowers regarding any amendments or restructuring. Furthermore, with our real estate equity team, we have the expertise in managing these types of properties and can take over in a workout situation if financially prudent. The current CECL allowance for our office portfolio is 3.5% of GAAP-carrying value and slightly over 5% for our traditional U.S. office properties. We believe we have one of the most conservative allowances in the industry and we\u2019re adequately reserved for potential credit losses. We believe our balance sheet is strong and our investment portfolio is resilient, and we are well positioned. We regularly stress-test our balance sheet for various potential risks, and that informs our decisions about capital management and allocation. For illustrative purposes, on the traditional U.S. office portfolio, if we were to assume a 30% instantaneous reduction in current property valuations, which already reflect a reduction from the peak and we were to further assume that any loan with an LTV ratio in excess of 100% after the shock is foreclosed upon. The incremental reduction in our Life Fleet RBC ratio would be approximately 11 RBC points. Our Life Fleet RBC ratio would have remained above target in this illustration had this scenario occurred as of the end of March. While this illustration assumes an instantaneous shock, it\u2019s important to remember that any deterioration in the traditional U.S. office sector will more likely play out over a longer time period. At this time, we expect it to be an earnings event and not a capital event. Finally, our real estate investment team is very experienced and has navigated challenging markets before. We continue to believe our traditional U.S. office exposure, which is only 2% of total investment \u2013 invested assets is manageable and any developments are likely to emerge over time. Now I\u2019ll hand the call back to Kevin.\nKevin Hogan: Thanks, Elias. We\u2019re very pleased with the solid progress we\u2019re making across Corebridge. Our balance sheet is very strong. Our profitability levels continue to improve, and we are confident that our well-managed investment portfolio is positioned to withstand near-term pressures. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is on capital. You guys just put in place a $1 billion buyback plan. I was hoping you could just give us some color around the pace of buyback and when you guys think you might start repurchasing your shares?\nKevin Hogan: Yes. Thanks, Elyse. Since the IPO, we\u2019ve been very focused on executing all the strategies to deliver our medium-term financial targets. One of those is the march towards a 12% to 14% ROE, and we feel we\u2019re making excellent progress there. One of them was our annual dividend of $600 million, which we\u2019ve now delivered on three quarters in a row. And then one of them was to have the financial flexibility to complement the dividend program with buybacks within six to nine months from the IPO. And we have that financial flexibility and see the authorization as a strong vote of confidence from the Board. And it\u2019s not a time-limited authorization. We\u2019re clearly committed to active capital management. And we believe that alignment with secondary is our most preferred path. And in the meantime, we\u2019re focused on executing all of the strategies necessary for us to maintain and grow this financial flexibility.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my second question was on the higher surrender rates in the quarter. So the fixed annuity surrender rate went up to 15%. But I know you guys have said that\u2019s within normal expectations. So I guess, what would you consider elevated for surrenders? And how would you expect to run your activity to trend from here?\nKevin Hogan: Yes. Thanks, Elyse. Surrenders\u2019 behaviors generally reflect crediting rates and where crediting rates are, which are influenced by both where base yields are and also where credit spreads are. And so in the first part of the first quarter, crediting rates were quite high, reflecting sort of the conditions late in the year, earlier in the year. And our dynamic lapse models really are driven by where those crediting rates are. Although surrender rates did increase again a little in the first quarter, not as much as new business sales because new business sales also reflect the impact of where crediting rates are. And so the surrender levels still were within our expectations based on where crediting rates were. And what I would say is that towards the latter part of the quarter, reflective of where yields and spreads were in the market, we saw some relief in crediting rates. And so we\u2019re \u2013 we continue to be within our expectations as to where surrenders would be relative to where market conditions are.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nJohn Barnidge: Thank you very much, and good morning. PRT sales step functioned higher this first quarter. First quarter is typically are lower and build throughout the year, but this first quarter across industry has been remarkably strong. Can you talk about your outlook for this market and where you see it geographically as well? Thank you.\nKevin Hogan: Yes. Thanks, John. Since 2016, we\u2019ve been very much focused on full plan terminations. And the market for full plan terminations, both in the U.S. and the UK are sort of a comparable size. And we\u2019ve developed both the underwriting and the administrative capabilities to support that business. We see a very strong pipeline both in the U.S. and the UK. And in fact, where funding levels of plans are right now, we\u2019re seeing larger and larger full plan terminations. These transactions are large. We underwrite them as almost many M&A transactions and the conditions were very good in the first quarter, both for the UK where we act as a reinsurer as well as the U.S. The activity in the first quarter primarily reflected success in UK transactions, but the pipeline looks very strong, both for the U.S. and the UK and full plan terminations. And the reason we focus on full plan terminations is there are fewer providers that are able to support the complexity of full plan terminations. And we find the economics on those transactions more attractive than commodity longevity transactions.\nJohn Barnidge: Thank you very much. My follow-up, while surrender activity was definitely higher in individual, it seemed to sequentially decline in the Group business. Can you maybe talk about those dynamics as well? Thank you.\nKevin Hogan: Sure. So the surrenders in the Group business also reflect larger planned behavior or planned behavior. And what we are seeing is that during the pandemic, there was a reduction in the kind of amount of group activity because plans weren\u2019t necessarily confident in going out to bid when the conditions were a little bit restrictive. We are seeing more plan-based activity now as more plans are going out for RFPs. So that\u2019s one aspect is the planned acquisition piece. In terms of the overall surrender rate, I think that some of the out-of-plan options are very attractive for investors right now, particularly fixed annuities. We\u2019re seeing strong growth in out-of-plan fixed annuities and the investment options that we\u2019re making available to customers, I think, are what\u2019s helping bring that surrender rate down.\nJohn Barnidge: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Alex, please go ahead.\nAlex Scott: The first one I had is on the office mortgages. Thanks for all the new disclosure. One of the things we\u2019ve looked at is just the valuation allowances, not only that you have on GAAP that you talked about earlier, but also the statutory valuation allowance. And so I had just a couple of quick questions on that. Having a higher statutory valuation allowance, is that a nuance to the way you approach assessing that? Or is it specifically related to loans that have some issues? And then maybe separately, when you gave the RBC sensitivity, it was that net of the statutory valuation allowance.\nElias Habayeb: Hey, Alex, it\u2019s Elias. So on both \u2013 let me tackle both of your questions. With respect to our allowances, whether for stat or GAAP, we\u2019ve historically been more conservative than others, and you see that going back into the AIG results. So it\u2019s not specific Corebridge. We just continue the same methodology forward, where we are leveraging kind of CMBS data and about estimating our expected losses. And \u2013 but it\u2019s kind of historical, as you know, the CMBS last experience has been worse than what\u2019s happened in commercial mortgage loans on Life companies, which have performed much better than that. So there\u2019s a level of conservatism built into how we approach allowances. And so both from a stat and GAAP perspective, we tend to carry higher allowances as a result. And I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s a reflection that our portfolio is any riskier. On your second question related to the sensitivity on RBC, yes, that is net of the statutory allowance.\nAlex Scott: Got it. And a follow-up question I had. It was related to some of the commentary on the AIG call. I think it was mentioned that Laya Healthcare was going to go through a sale process. And my question for you all is, are there other actions, whether it\u2019s a sale, reinsurance and so forth that you would potentially pursue to increase capital capacity to help speed up a separation of your business from AIG?\nKevin Hogan: Yes. Thanks, Alex. Look, the decision relative to Laya, it\u2019s a very good business. It has a strong management team, but the health insurance industry is not core to Life & Retirement and our other expertise. And this \u2013 it\u2019s very early in the process. So I can\u2019t really say much more about that at this time. We generally don\u2019t talk about kind of live transactions. But we understand how our responsibility is to optimize the portfolio, and we have continually looked at those opportunities. And the creation of Fortitude Re some four or five years ago, I think, was a great example of how we are conscious of those opportunities. We continuously look at various portfolios, and we are aware of what market conditions are. And so far, we haven\u2019t seen anything that makes economic sense relative to the overall portfolio. We\u2019ll continue to stay current relative to that. But I do see the optimization strategy versus having financial flexibility rather to the \u2013 relative to the buybacks as two different areas of our responsibility. And relative to the buybacks, we have the financial flexibility. We have our Board\u2019s support. There are different paths to the proceeds, but everything is also dependent on market conditions at a given time.\nAlex Scott: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Erik Bass from Autonomous. Erik, please go ahead.\nErik Bass: Hi. Thank you, and I appreciate the additional color and disclosure on the investment portfolio. Maybe zooming back, you mentioned doing stress test analysis and factoring that into your capital plans. So I was hoping you could give us some color on how you\u2019re thinking about potential capital impacts in a broader stress scenario for credit or CRE, so moving outside of just office?\nElias Habayeb: Hey, Erik, it\u2019s Elias. So as part of kind of regular process, we run a bunch of different stress tests on us looking at different variables and not focusing on an individual variable. And that kind of all informs kind of what\u2019s our capital plans and what we\u2019re comfortable with. And in the base case, we generally assume some level of rating like \u2013 negative rating migration as well as some level of downside credit protection in our base case, but we do strength it beyond that. And with respect to rating migration, the one thing I would say is if you look at 2022 as well as separately the first quarter of 2023, while in our base case, we did assume some level of downward rating migration, what we\u2019ve experienced has been positive rating migration when looking at the portfolio as a whole.\nErik Bass: Got it. But I guess thinking \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re willing to disclose the number, but is there something you think of as a stress scenario impact for capital?\nElias Habayeb: So we don\u2019t focus it on \u2013 so we don\u2019t focus on a single scenario. We look at a variety of scenarios. And we don\u2019t just look at credit. We also look at what market factors could do like what happens with rates, what happens with equities on the portfolio. And so we look at it from a totality to decide what we\u2019re comfortable with. We don\u2019t focus on one scenario or the other.\nErik Bass: Got it. Okay. And then separately, the cost of funds looks like it\u2019s starting to increase in Individual Retirement. I\u2019m hoping you could talk a little bit about, do you still see room to improve spreads from higher interest rates? Are we getting to the point where more of the benefit is getting passed through to policyholders?\nKevin Hogan: Thanks, Erik. I don\u2019t think characterizing it as passing more of the benefit to policyholders as appropriate. We continue to see growth in our net spreads, both sequentially as well as year-over-year across Individual Retirement, there\u2019s still a 44 basis point increase in sequential spreads. In terms of where rates and credit spreads are, the pace at which spreads will expand, I think we\u2019ll \u2013 and I think Elias had it in his prepared remarks, right, the trajectory is not necessarily going to stay the same. But we have not seen growth in the cost of funds impacting our ability to expand the spreads still in the Individual business.\nElias Habayeb: So Erik, if I can add to what Kevin said. So our base spreads are strong. Our base spreads have continued to expand, if you look at index annuities and fixed annuities, despite what\u2019s happening on the cost of fund side, if you look at index annuities, the cost of fund has been sequentially increasing as has the base yield increase and the growth in the base yield that\u2019s outpaced the growth in the cost of funds. And what you\u2019re seeing on fixed annuities, it\u2019s part driven by new business. We\u2019re seeing a step up in the cost of funds, just the weighted average mix of the portfolio. But even with that, the base yield is still growing faster. The other thing on the forward trajectory, listen, when we buy a bond with a 5% or 6% handle, that doesn\u2019t change tomorrow if market rates change. So we continue to expect strong base spread income from the portfolio as well as strong base spreads going forward. Now the \u2013 given where the market\u2019s outlook is today, that growth trajectory will slow down over time, but we continue to expect a strong base spread income from the book.\nErik Bass: Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Ryan, please go ahead.\nRyan Krueger: Thanks. Good morning. On the $1.8 billion of holding company liquidity, how much of that is earmarked on a cash basis for remaining separation costs and other one-time costs related to the cost savings plan?\nElias Habayeb: So Ryan, it\u2019s Elias. So the way we look at our liquidity is we look at kind of for what\u2019s the remaining 12-month needs, and we kind of reserve for it in our liquidity today. And when we\u2019re sitting now at the end of March, we\u2019re sitting with liquidity in excess of the next 12-month needs. If you go back to the buckets of one-time expenses we were covering, one was on separation. Our estimate was $350 million to $450 million. And we\u2019ve already incurred based on our disclosures around $230 million against it. And with respect to Corebridge Forward, our estimate for one-time expenses is about $300 million. We\u2019ve incurred about $100 million. Now not all the $300 million is cash. We do expect the bulk of that to play out over the next 12 months, but there might be a bit longer tail on the smaller amount.\nRyan Krueger: I guess maybe to ask differently, could you just tell us how much in excess of the next 12 months needs the current cash position is at the holding company?\nElias Habayeb: Yes. So that\u2019s the number that\u2019s variable. But I think you could look at where we were at the end of last year as an example.\nRyan Krueger: Got it. And then I may have missed this, but did you give us an update on the allowances for loan losses as of the first quarter on a statutory basis?\nElias Habayeb: So the allowances, we have not \u2013 I have not given the number, but I\u2019m happy to. Our estimate is still around $400 million on the kind of the overall commercial mortgage loan portfolio as of the end of the first quarter.\nRyan Krueger: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Ward from Citi. Michael, please go ahead.\nMichael Ward: Thanks guys. Good morning. Thank you for all the investment portfolio color. I was just thinking through the office exposure. I\u2019m curious about the CMBS component. I think about one-third of your CMBS is office or a little over $3 billion of par. So I\u2019m just wondering if you could maybe confirm that. And then if you have any similar color on the office CMBS in terms of loan metrics and how you feel about that exposure?\nElias Habayeb: Hey, I\u2019m happy to do that. So our CMBS book is a pretty diversified portfolio. It\u2019s about 5% of our total invested assets. That includes both agency and non-agency. And if I look at the non-agency piece, it\u2019s broken down between conduit and SASB base. The conduit piece, while it has some level of office exposure, given the mix of the pool, we\u2019ve got more than sufficient subordination in those deals since we invest in the top part of the capital structure and virtually everything we hold is NAIC-1. When we look at the SASB portfolio, a fraction of less than 40% has office exposure. We underwrite those deals very similar to how we underwrite the commercial mortgage loan when we make a decision to invest or not invest. It\u2019s primarily \u2013 it\u2019s all investment grade. It\u2019s primarily NAIC-1 and those continue to have low LTVs and high debt service coverage ratios and high occupancies within them. So we\u2019re comfortable with that portfolio. And a lot of it are either trophy buildings or property in premier locations.\nMichael Ward: Okay. Thanks very much. And then maybe I was just hoping you could provide some more color on the sale of the CLO manager. Curious if you retain any equity and maybe the motivation behind that sale. I would have \u2013 I think the asset class has been attractive for Lifecos.\nElias Habayeb: Happy to. With respect to the CLO manager, the decision to sell it was more about kind of our forward operating model for how we want to manage our investments. And with the focus on having our investment team focused on managing the Corebridge balance sheet, working with now two external managers, it didn\u2019t make sense for us to continue to own the CLO manager. While we do still have some of the residuals on the deals that were sponsored or managed by the CLO, one of the things that\u2019s happened with the sale is we\u2019ve deconsolidated most of the CLOs that were on our balance sheet. So when you look at our balance sheet, and for example, a good area, look at debt from consolidated investment entities, there was a material drop in the first quarter, and that\u2019s tied to deconsolidating CLOs with the sale.\nMichael Ward: Okay. Are you able to quantify the equity that you might still hold?\nElias Habayeb: It\u2019s not a big number that we still hold.\nMichael Ward: Okay. Thank you. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Jimmy, please go ahead.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning. So first, I just had a question on your commercial mortgage loan book. I think you mentioned that there are two loans that are 90 days or less delinquent. And the amount seems fairly large $276 million of apartment buildings. Can you discuss what that is and what your view of that exposure is overall?\nElias Habayeb: So on the two loans I had mentioned, $8 million is in the office space. We have about two loans in the office space that were delinquent by like 90 days-plus. We don\u2019t have anything else like in the office space.\nJimmy Bhullar: No, I mentioned less than 90 days that\u2019s [the twos] that were delinquent less than 90 days.\nElias Habayeb: Yes. Those \u2013 that\u2019s on the office space. We will have to come back to you, but I\u2019m not aware of anything specific or concerning about those properties. It might be an operating thing, but we\u2019ll come back to it, Jimmy.\nJimmy Bhullar: Yes. Those \u2013 and those were in the apartment classification, not office, but \u2013 and then just on the fixed annuity market and index annuity, your sales have grown a lot of other companies are trying to grow in that business as well as they\u2019re pulling out of variable annuities. Just wondering how you see competition in those two product lines with higher interest rates? Are competitors still being disciplined? Or are you seeing some companies sort of be aggressive on terms and conditions or crediting rates just in an effort to grow?\nKevin Hogan: So yes, thanks, Jimmy. I think that our ability to move on the scales reflects the tremendous distribution access that we have that we\u2019ve built up over many years. And we work on a truly strategic relationship with many of our distribution partners. So we understand maybe a little bit in advance what we need to do to be prepared to support their strategies. And that allows us to get beyond just talking about what might be on the shelf in the next quarter or two quarters and really think about longer-term planning. But we feel good about the fact that we were able to pivot quickly. We were able to scale quickly. I think our relationship with Blackstone was helpful in terms of their ability to scale asset origination. And that\u2019s what\u2019s really been behind the growth. We do not \u2013 we have not seen anything to suggest margin compression. We continue to see very attractive new business margins that are north of what our medium-term return profile expectations would be. So that\u2019s how I would summarize our ability to grow more rapidly in the fixed annuity business as I would get back to our distribution platform.\nJimmy Bhullar: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies. Suneet, please go ahead.\nSuneet Kamath: Great. Thanks. Just maybe two quick ones. First, on the buyback, I just want to be clear in terms of the messaging. Are you saying that your buyback would be essentially tied to an AIG secondary? Or would you be open to repurchasing shares from the open market even if there is no secondary?\nKevin Hogan: No, there\u2019s no limitation as we see it. It will completely depend on sort of market conditions and other considerations at the time. I think the important takeaways are that we said that we would have the financial flexibility within six to nine months from the IPO, and we have it, that our Board is confident in our financial strength and position and has supported it. It is not a time-limited authorization, which gives us a lot of flexibilities. And there are different paths to proceeds. Some are more obvious than others. But we\u2019re not limiting in any way our options at this time. We are focusing on executing our strategies and increasing our financial flexibility.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay. Got it. And then I guess on the surrenders in fixed annuities, is there a way of tracking if that money is essentially going into a new Corebridge annuity? Because my thought is, if these contracts are outside of surrender charge, there\u2019s probably some limitations in terms of how long you can invest the underlying funds. But if it gets recycled into a new product, then perhaps that\u2019s good for spreads. So I just wanted to see if there\u2019s any way to think through that issue.\nKevin Hogan: Yes. So there are, obviously, exchange possibilities, and we monitor the impact net of the exchanges. But we also \u2013 I think important relative to the surrenders is that we do have the option of increasing crediting rates. Should we decide that, that was more economically attractive than otherwise. And so far, we haven\u2019t necessarily seen that to be economically attractive. And so I kind of separate those two things in our minds. We have options if we felt that there were more value in limiting the surrenders. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything you wanted to add, Elias.\nElias Habayeb: And what I would add, just echoing what something Kevin said and I said earlier is yes, the surrenders are increasing, it\u2019s increasing as you would expect in the rate \u2013 what\u2019s going on in the rate environment. Despite the increase, the net flows into the general account are positive and if you look sequentially, have almost doubled. And beyond that, while we do that math economically, the liquidity in the insurance companies is very strong. We\u2019ve got very strong capital coming off the investment portfolio. We\u2019ve got a sizable liquid portfolio \u2013 liquid fixed income portfolio if we ever need to do anything with it. We haven\u2019t had to do anything with it there. And we\u2019ve got options beyond selling assets if we need to raise short-term liquidity. None of that have we had to do so far.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. That is now the end of the Q&A session. I\u2019ll now hand you back over to Kevin Hogan for closing remarks.\nKevin Hogan: Okay. Thanks, everybody. Appreciate the questions. Hope you have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Elias Habayeb",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. I will provide additional information on our financial results and key performance metrics as well as comment on our investment portfolio, including office exposure within the commercial mortgage loan portfolio. But first, I'd like to make a couple of comments on LDTI. Last week, we released our restated 2021 and 2022 results for LDTI. As we previously said, we expect LDTI to reduce volatility in our operating results by minimizing the impact from variability in market conditions and mortality experience. At the same time, LDTI increased our adjusted book value as of December 31, 2022 by approximately $2 billion to $23.4 billion. That being said, LDTI does not impact the economics of our business nor our statutory capital and cash flows. Turning to our financial results. As Kevin noted, we had strong first quarter results driven by growing base spread income. Our operating EPS was $0.97, our adjusted ROE was 10.8%, and our adjusted pre-tax operating income was $724 million. This includes a notable item that contributed $0.06 to EPS and was offset by alternative investment returns below our long-term expectations by $0.14. Adjusting for these items, our operating EPS for the quarter would have been $1.05. In addition, our adjusted ROE would have exceeded 11% even with the higher adjusted book value from LDTI. This demonstrates the progress we're making towards achieving our target of 12% to 14% in 2024. With respect to adjusted pre-tax operating income, our results were $185 million below the prior year due to lower variable investment income, which accounted for over $270 million of the decline as well as $70 million of additional interest expense resulting from financial debt issued in the second and third quarters of 2022. Excluding variable investment income, adjusted pre-tax operating income was 14% higher than the first quarter of 2022, largely due to increasing base spread income and improved mortality experience. Sequentially, our reported adjusted pre-tax operating income was $20 million higher than the fourth quarter. Excluding variable investment income, adjusted pre-tax operating income was 2% higher, largely due to increasing base spread income, partially offset by $43 million of favorable non-recurring items in the fourth quarter. Our core sources of income in aggregate increased by 15%, driven by growth in base spread income and improvement in underwriting margins, partially offset by lower fee income. Shifting to net investment income. Base yield was 4.42% in the fourth quarter, up 60 basis points year-on-year. This was the third consecutive quarter of significant growth, driven by a combination of reinvestment activity at higher new money rates and resets on floating rate assets as well as an increase in total invested assets. Average new money yields were 6.5% in the fourth quarter, which was approximately 230 basis points higher than the average yield on assets rolling out of our portfolio. Stripping out the notable item in base net investment income from last quarter, base yields improved 15 basis points on a sequential basis. In aggregate, this improvement far outweighed any increase in policyholder crediting rates. Moving to expenses. Our GOE declined 2% sequentially. The benefits of the Corebridge Forward savings earning in were offset by incremental costs related to our establishment of our standalone capabilities as well as regular first quarter seasonality and compensation expense. Next, I will speak briefly about our segment results. Individual Retirement reported adjusted pre-tax operating income of $534 million for the quarter, an increase of 14% year-over-year or an increase of 55% after excluding variable investment income. Base spread income rose 49% over the prior year, driven by spread expansion and growth in general account products, while base net investment spreads increased 71 basis points year-over-year and 17 basis points sequentially. Fee income declined by 10% due to lower asset valuations and net outflows in our variable annuity portfolio. Fee income was flat relative to the fourth quarter, reflecting stabilization in asset values. As Kevin mentioned, general account net flows were positive at nearly $1.3 billion, up from approximately $700 million last quarter, despite an increase in surrender rates. Group Retirement reported adjusted pre-tax operating income of $186 million for the quarter, a decrease of 23% year-over-year or an increase of 7% after excluding variable investment income. Base spread income grew 20% from the first quarter of 2022 due to spread expansion, while fee income declined 12% year-over-year due to lower asset valuations and net outflows. Base net investment spread increased 24 basis points year-over-year, but decreased 7 basis points sequentially. The sequential quarter decline is driven by 10 basis points rise in cost of funds, largely attributed to out-of-plan fixed annuity product growth and higher crediting rates based on annual resets to certain in-force products. This more than offset the sequential increase in base yield. Consistent with previous quarters, we continue to see outflows concentrated in the higher GMIR buckets. We expect this trend to improve the profitability of the business over time. Looking at projections for next quarter, we expect net flows will \u2013 net outflows will increase due to additional planned losses, but with limited impact to the general account. As a reminder, plan acquisitions and losses are nonlinear and vary from quarter-to-quarter. Also, we're seeing a general pickup in plan activity, both acquisitions and losses as COVID moves from pandemic to endemic and plan sponsors are more willing to put plans out a bit. Life Insurance reported adjusted pre-tax operating income of $82 million for the quarter, a decrease of 2% year-over-year or an increase of 148% after excluding variable investment income. Underwriting margin, excluding variable investment income, improved 11% year-over-year due to improved mortality experience and higher base portfolio income. With the adoption of LDTI, variability in operating earnings for traditional life products like term is muted given that actual mortality experience will be largely offset by reserve releases in any single period. However, that's not the case for universal life as the accounting is not impacted by LDTI and where our experience was favorable in the first quarter. Institutional Markets reported adjusted pre-tax operating income of $85 million for the quarter, a decrease of 26% year-over-year or an increase of 3% after excluding variable investment income. Core sources of income expanded 7% over the prior year, largely due to base spread income, while reserves for our Pension Risk Transfer business grew 33% year-over-year on an original discount basis. And lastly, our Corporate and Other segment reported a loss of $163 million for the quarter. This loss is largely consistent with our expectations given new parent company expenses as well as our standalone capital structure. I will now provide some comments about our balance sheet, liquidity and capital. We assess our balance sheet through different lenses, including but not limited to, financial leverage, liquidity, capital and the overall risk profile. By each of these measures, our balance sheet is very healthy and strong. Adjusted book value was $23.3 billion or $35.88 per share, up 4% year-over-year, but down 1% from the fourth quarter. The sequential decline was due to non-operating mark-to-market losses. Our financial leverage ratio was 27.9%, which is well within our target range. We continue to expect that our balance sheet will naturally delever over time as a result of book value growth. And as a reminder, the next debt maturity is in 2025. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of $1.8 billion, an increase from $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Our insurance companies distributed $500 million during the first quarter. And as Kevin noted, we paid dividends to our shareholders of approximately $150 million, bringing the total paid to shareholders since the IPO to approximately $450 million. We declared our dividend for the second quarter of 2023, which will be paid on June 30. Our Life Fleet RBC ratio remains very strong. We estimate our first quarter Life Fleet RBC ratio to be in the range of 410% to 420% and exceeding our year-end RBC ratio of 411%. Next, I will spend a few minutes talking about our investment portfolio. Corebridge has a high-quality, well-diversified investment portfolio that's actively managed. Portfolio construction is backed by rigorous underwriting, monitoring and credit risk management processes designed to protect and optimize the balance sheet. The GAAP-carrying value of our general account investment portfolio was $193 billion as of March 31, 2023. Approximately 94% of our fixed income investments were rated investment grade. Our NAIC 3 to 6 investments were $8.4 billion, a figure that's approximately $600 million lower than the end of 2022, in part due to the derisking actions that Kevin described earlier. Now turning to commercial mortgage loans. Like our broader investment strategy, our commercial mortgage loan portfolio is high-quality, well-diversified and actively managed to support our insurance liabilities. It's backed by a disciplined and rigorous approach to underwriting and risk management. In addition, the valuations of the underlying properties are updated on an annual basis. As of March 31, our portfolio was $30.3 billion, making up 16% of total invested assets. These loans are primarily highly rated, longer-dated, fixed-rate first-lien loans with low LTVs and strong debt service coverage ratios. Each loan is carefully underwritten with embedded covenant protections. Our portfolio is diversified by both geography and sector, with nearly 60% of the portfolio comprised of multifamily and industrial property, reflecting our strong bias to these sectors over the last decade. Commercial mortgage loans secured by office properties were $7.7 billion or 4% of total invested assets as of March 31. These loans are also high-quality, carefully underwritten and covenant-heavy with strong credit characteristics. Over the past several years, we've been actively reducing our exposure to office and emphasizing multifamily, industrial and other nontraditional office sectors as well as properties in Europe. As part of this evolving view, our exposure to traditional U.S. office is down from its peak. The traditional U.S. office portfolio component was $4.5 billion as of March 31, which is approximately 2% of our total invested assets. The remainder of the portfolio is in life sciences, mixed-use properties and ground leases as well as international office properties where the fundamentals are stronger than in the U.S. Our office portfolio enjoys strong credit metrics, which are as follows: it's highly rated with 94% of our loans designated CM1 or CM2. It's high-quality with almost 80% of the property consisting of Class A properties in major metropolitan areas and concentrated in central business districts. The weighted average loan-to-value is 63% and the weighted average debt service coverage ratio is over 2 times. It has strong occupancy ratios in the mid-80s. 80% of the fixed loan \u2013 of the loans are fixed rate. It has longer-dated loans with a weighted average remaining term of 7.5 years and only two loans are delinquent together carrying an outstanding balance of $8 million. Over our history, we have from time to time originated large loans where we felt very comfortable with the fundamentals, sponsor and location. Within our traditional U.S. office portfolio, we have three loans in excess of $200 million, all originated prior to 2019. The office properties are very building-specific, so it's crucial to evaluate each property carefully, no matter the size of the loan. We have approximately $1.2 billion of loans secured by traditional U.S. office properties with final maturity dates in 2023 and 2024, a figure that represents less than 1% of our total invested assets. Of that $1.2 billion, approximately $870 million have a final maturity date in 2023. As of May 4, we have resolved almost half of the 2023 maturities through either payoffs or extensions. Our traditional U.S. office exposure within New York City, where we have longer dated \u2013 longer tenure loans with solid debt service coverage ratios and strong occupancies is about 1% of total invested assets. Of the $870 million maturities for 2023, approximately $600 million are in New York City. One-third of these have already been resolved through either payoffs or extensions and the remaining properties underlying the [2023] maturities have extremely strong fundamentals and occupancy rates over 90%. As part of our standard monitoring process for any commercial mortgage loans, we proactively engage with borrowers regarding their refinancing plans well in advance of maturity. As a result, before this quarter began, we were already conducting routine surveillance on our upcoming maturities. On the extensions we've agreed to so far, we've been successful in getting a combination of various structural and capital enhancements. We are a lead lender in approximately 87% of our office originations, which affords us control over negotiations with borrowers regarding any amendments or restructuring. Furthermore, with our real estate equity team, we have the expertise in managing these types of properties and can take over in a workout situation if financially prudent. The current CECL allowance for our office portfolio is 3.5% of GAAP-carrying value and slightly over 5% for our traditional U.S. office properties. We believe we have one of the most conservative allowances in the industry and we're adequately reserved for potential credit losses. We believe our balance sheet is strong and our investment portfolio is resilient, and we are well positioned. We regularly stress-test our balance sheet for various potential risks, and that informs our decisions about capital management and allocation. For illustrative purposes, on the traditional U.S. office portfolio, if we were to assume a 30% instantaneous reduction in current property valuations, which already reflect a reduction from the peak and we were to further assume that any loan with an LTV ratio in excess of 100% after the shock is foreclosed upon. The incremental reduction in our Life Fleet RBC ratio would be approximately 11 RBC points. Our Life Fleet RBC ratio would have remained above target in this illustration had this scenario occurred as of the end of March. While this illustration assumes an instantaneous shock, it's important to remember that any deterioration in the traditional U.S. office sector will more likely play out over a longer time period. At this time, we expect it to be an earnings event and not a capital event. Finally, our real estate investment team is very experienced and has navigated challenging markets before. We continue to believe our traditional U.S. office exposure, which is only 2% of total investment \u2013 invested assets is manageable and any developments are likely to emerge over time. Now I'll hand the call back to Kevin. Hey, Alex, it's Elias. So on both \u2013 let me tackle both of your questions. With respect to our allowances, whether for stat or GAAP, we've historically been more conservative than others, and you see that going back into the AIG results. So it's not specific Corebridge. We just continue the same methodology forward, where we are leveraging kind of CMBS data and about estimating our expected losses. And \u2013 but it's kind of historical, as you know, the CMBS last experience has been worse than what's happened in commercial mortgage loans on Life companies, which have performed much better than that. So there's a level of conservatism built into how we approach allowances. And so both from a stat and GAAP perspective, we tend to carry higher allowances as a result. And I don't believe that's a reflection that our portfolio is any riskier. On your second question related to the sensitivity on RBC, yes, that is net of the statutory allowance. Hey, Erik, it's Elias. So as part of kind of regular process, we run a bunch of different stress tests on us looking at different variables and not focusing on an individual variable. And that kind of all informs kind of what's our capital plans and what we're comfortable with. And in the base case, we generally assume some level of rating like \u2013 negative rating migration as well as some level of downside credit protection in our base case, but we do strength it beyond that. And with respect to rating migration, the one thing I would say is if you look at 2022 as well as separately the first quarter of 2023, while in our base case, we did assume some level of downward rating migration, what we've experienced has been positive rating migration when looking at the portfolio as a whole. So we don't focus it on \u2013 so we don't focus on a single scenario. We look at a variety of scenarios. And we don't just look at credit. We also look at what market factors could do like what happens with rates, what happens with equities on the portfolio. And so we look at it from a totality to decide what we're comfortable with. We don't focus on one scenario or the other. So Erik, if I can add to what Kevin said. So our base spreads are strong. Our base spreads have continued to expand, if you look at index annuities and fixed annuities, despite what's happening on the cost of fund side, if you look at index annuities, the cost of fund has been sequentially increasing as has the base yield increase and the growth in the base yield that's outpaced the growth in the cost of funds. And what you're seeing on fixed annuities, it's part driven by new business. We're seeing a step up in the cost of funds, just the weighted average mix of the portfolio. But even with that, the base yield is still growing faster. The other thing on the forward trajectory, listen, when we buy a bond with a 5% or 6% handle, that doesn't change tomorrow if market rates change. So we continue to expect strong base spread income from the portfolio as well as strong base spreads going forward. Now the \u2013 given where the market's outlook is today, that growth trajectory will slow down over time, but we continue to expect a strong base spread income from the book. So Ryan, it's Elias. So the way we look at our liquidity is we look at kind of for what's the remaining 12-month needs, and we kind of reserve for it in our liquidity today. And when we're sitting now at the end of March, we're sitting with liquidity in excess of the next 12-month needs. If you go back to the buckets of one-time expenses we were covering, one was on separation. Our estimate was $350 million to $450 million. And we've already incurred based on our disclosures around $230 million against it. And with respect to Corebridge Forward, our estimate for one-time expenses is about $300 million. We've incurred about $100 million. Now not all the $300 million is cash. We do expect the bulk of that to play out over the next 12 months, but there might be a bit longer tail on the smaller amount. Yes. So that's the number that's variable. But I think you could look at where we were at the end of last year as an example. So the allowances, we have not \u2013 I have not given the number, but I'm happy to. Our estimate is still around $400 million on the kind of the overall commercial mortgage loan portfolio as of the end of the first quarter. Hey, I'm happy to do that. So our CMBS book is a pretty diversified portfolio. It's about 5% of our total invested assets. That includes both agency and non-agency. And if I look at the non-agency piece, it's broken down between conduit and SASB base. The conduit piece, while it has some level of office exposure, given the mix of the pool, we've got more than sufficient subordination in those deals since we invest in the top part of the capital structure and virtually everything we hold is NAIC-1. When we look at the SASB portfolio, a fraction of less than 40% has office exposure. We underwrite those deals very similar to how we underwrite the commercial mortgage loan when we make a decision to invest or not invest. It's primarily \u2013 it's all investment grade. It's primarily NAIC-1 and those continue to have low LTVs and high debt service coverage ratios and high occupancies within them. So we're comfortable with that portfolio. And a lot of it are either trophy buildings or property in premier locations. Happy to. With respect to the CLO manager, the decision to sell it was more about kind of our forward operating model for how we want to manage our investments. And with the focus on having our investment team focused on managing the Corebridge balance sheet, working with now two external managers, it didn't make sense for us to continue to own the CLO manager. While we do still have some of the residuals on the deals that were sponsored or managed by the CLO, one of the things that's happened with the sale is we've deconsolidated most of the CLOs that were on our balance sheet. So when you look at our balance sheet, and for example, a good area, look at debt from consolidated investment entities, there was a material drop in the first quarter, and that's tied to deconsolidating CLOs with the sale. It's not a big number that we still hold. So on the two loans I had mentioned, $8 million is in the office space. We have about two loans in the office space that were delinquent by like 90 days-plus. We don't have anything else like in the office space. Yes. Those \u2013 that's on the office space. We will have to come back to you, but I'm not aware of anything specific or concerning about those properties. It might be an operating thing, but we'll come back to it, Jimmy. And what I would add, just echoing what something Kevin said and I said earlier is yes, the surrenders are increasing, it's increasing as you would expect in the rate \u2013 what's going on in the rate environment. Despite the increase, the net flows into the general account are positive and if you look sequentially, have almost doubled. And beyond that, while we do that math economically, the liquidity in the insurance companies is very strong. We've got very strong capital coming off the investment portfolio. We've got a sizable liquid portfolio \u2013 liquid fixed income portfolio if we ever need to do anything with it. We haven't had to do anything with it there. And we've got options beyond selling assets if we need to raise short-term liquidity. None of that have we had to do so far."

            "name": "Kevin Hogan",
            "content": "Thanks, Elias. We're very pleased with the solid progress we're making across Corebridge. Our balance sheet is very strong. Our profitability levels continue to improve, and we are confident that our well-managed investment portfolio is positioned to withstand near-term pressures. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Yes. Thanks, Elyse. Since the IPO, we've been very focused on executing all the strategies to deliver our medium-term financial targets. One of those is the march towards a 12% to 14% ROE, and we feel we're making excellent progress there. One of them was our annual dividend of $600 million, which we've now delivered on three quarters in a row. And then one of them was to have the financial flexibility to complement the dividend program with buybacks within six to nine months from the IPO. And we have that financial flexibility and see the authorization as a strong vote of confidence from the Board. And it's not a time-limited authorization. We're clearly committed to active capital management. And we believe that alignment with secondary is our most preferred path. And in the meantime, we're focused on executing all of the strategies necessary for us to maintain and grow this financial flexibility. Yes. Thanks, Elyse. Surrenders' behaviors generally reflect crediting rates and where crediting rates are, which are influenced by both where base yields are and also where credit spreads are. And so in the first part of the first quarter, crediting rates were quite high, reflecting sort of the conditions late in the year, earlier in the year. And our dynamic lapse models really are driven by where those crediting rates are. Although surrender rates did increase again a little in the first quarter, not as much as new business sales because new business sales also reflect the impact of where crediting rates are. And so the surrender levels still were within our expectations based on where crediting rates were. And what I would say is that towards the latter part of the quarter, reflective of where yields and spreads were in the market, we saw some relief in crediting rates. And so we're \u2013 we continue to be within our expectations as to where surrenders would be relative to where market conditions are. Yes. Thanks, John. Since 2016, we've been very much focused on full plan terminations. And the market for full plan terminations, both in the U.S. and the UK are sort of a comparable size. And we've developed both the underwriting and the administrative capabilities to support that business. We see a very strong pipeline both in the U.S. and the UK. And in fact, where funding levels of plans are right now, we're seeing larger and larger full plan terminations. These transactions are large. We underwrite them as almost many M&A transactions and the conditions were very good in the first quarter, both for the UK where we act as a reinsurer as well as the U.S. The activity in the first quarter primarily reflected success in UK transactions, but the pipeline looks very strong, both for the U.S. and the UK and full plan terminations. And the reason we focus on full plan terminations is there are fewer providers that are able to support the complexity of full plan terminations. And we find the economics on those transactions more attractive than commodity longevity transactions. Sure. So the surrenders in the Group business also reflect larger planned behavior or planned behavior. And what we are seeing is that during the pandemic, there was a reduction in the kind of amount of group activity because plans weren't necessarily confident in going out to bid when the conditions were a little bit restrictive. We are seeing more plan-based activity now as more plans are going out for RFPs. So that's one aspect is the planned acquisition piece. In terms of the overall surrender rate, I think that some of the out-of-plan options are very attractive for investors right now, particularly fixed annuities. We're seeing strong growth in out-of-plan fixed annuities and the investment options that we're making available to customers, I think, are what's helping bring that surrender rate down. Yes. Thanks, Alex. Look, the decision relative to Laya, it's a very good business. It has a strong management team, but the health insurance industry is not core to Life & Retirement and our other expertise. And this \u2013 it's very early in the process. So I can't really say much more about that at this time. We generally don't talk about kind of live transactions. But we understand how our responsibility is to optimize the portfolio, and we have continually looked at those opportunities. And the creation of Fortitude Re some four or five years ago, I think, was a great example of how we are conscious of those opportunities. We continuously look at various portfolios, and we are aware of what market conditions are. And so far, we haven't seen anything that makes economic sense relative to the overall portfolio. We'll continue to stay current relative to that. But I do see the optimization strategy versus having financial flexibility rather to the \u2013 relative to the buybacks as two different areas of our responsibility. And relative to the buybacks, we have the financial flexibility. We have our Board's support. There are different paths to the proceeds, but everything is also dependent on market conditions at a given time. Thanks, Erik. I don't think characterizing it as passing more of the benefit to policyholders as appropriate. We continue to see growth in our net spreads, both sequentially as well as year-over-year across Individual Retirement, there's still a 44 basis point increase in sequential spreads. In terms of where rates and credit spreads are, the pace at which spreads will expand, I think we'll \u2013 and I think Elias had it in his prepared remarks, right, the trajectory is not necessarily going to stay the same. But we have not seen growth in the cost of funds impacting our ability to expand the spreads still in the Individual business. So yes, thanks, Jimmy. I think that our ability to move on the scales reflects the tremendous distribution access that we have that we've built up over many years. And we work on a truly strategic relationship with many of our distribution partners. So we understand maybe a little bit in advance what we need to do to be prepared to support their strategies. And that allows us to get beyond just talking about what might be on the shelf in the next quarter or two quarters and really think about longer-term planning. But we feel good about the fact that we were able to pivot quickly. We were able to scale quickly. I think our relationship with Blackstone was helpful in terms of their ability to scale asset origination. And that's what's really been behind the growth. We do not \u2013 we have not seen anything to suggest margin compression. We continue to see very attractive new business margins that are north of what our medium-term return profile expectations would be. So that's how I would summarize our ability to grow more rapidly in the fixed annuity business as I would get back to our distribution platform. No, there's no limitation as we see it. It will completely depend on sort of market conditions and other considerations at the time. I think the important takeaways are that we said that we would have the financial flexibility within six to nine months from the IPO, and we have it, that our Board is confident in our financial strength and position and has supported it. It is not a time-limited authorization, which gives us a lot of flexibilities. And there are different paths to proceeds. Some are more obvious than others. But we're not limiting in any way our options at this time. We are focusing on executing our strategies and increasing our financial flexibility. Yes. So there are, obviously, exchange possibilities, and we monitor the impact net of the exchanges. But we also \u2013 I think important relative to the surrenders is that we do have the option of increasing crediting rates. Should we decide that, that was more economically attractive than otherwise. And so far, we haven't necessarily seen that to be economically attractive. And so I kind of separate those two things in our minds. We have options if we felt that there were more value in limiting the surrenders. I don't know if there's anything you wanted to add, Elias. Okay. Thanks, everybody. Appreciate the questions. Hope you have a good day."

            "name": "A - Kevin Hogan",
            "content": "Thank you, Josh, and good morning, everyone. Corebridge is off to a very good start in 2023, having delivered another excellent quarter. Our businesses generated great results, and we continue to make advances on our strategic initiatives. Today, I will update you on the progress we are making towards our financial goals, including an important development in our capital management program. I will also speak to our business performance and strategic initiatives, concluding with comments on our disciplined approach to risk management and high-quality investment portfolio. Elias will then provide additional detail on our financial results and a deep dive into our commercial real estate portfolio. As we have said before, Corebridge Financial is committed to deploying capital to create value for our shareholders. Since our IPO, we have returned approximately $450 million in dividends to our shareholders. And today, we announced our fourth consecutive quarterly dividend of $0.23 per share, totaling approximately $150 million. We have been working to complement our dividend program with additional return of capital. And last week, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $1 billion. This share repurchase program is a reflection of our confidence in the strength of our financial position as we balance investments in long-term growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet with ample levels of liquidity and capital. It is an important step towards our ultimate goal of providing an attractive return for shareholders. Now turning to our results. We delivered earnings per share of $0.97 with adjusted return on average equity of 10.8% and adjusted pre-tax operating income of $724 million. Corebridge's business is positioned to perform across various market cycles. This quarter demonstrates once more that we can consistently deliver strong results across our diversified businesses. Adjusting for variable investment income, which was impacted by capital markets dislocation, the earnings power of our insurance businesses improved year-over-year. Tailwinds from higher interest rates, wider credit spreads and favorable mortality experience more than offset headwinds from equity market performance. This was the second consecutive quarter, our aggregate core sources of income grew by 15% on a year-over-year basis. Base spread income grew 38% compared to the prior year, due in part to higher new money rates and continuing growth in spread-based products. This quarter, we delivered very strong sales with attractive margins, generating higher general account cash flows. Across our four lines of business, we generated total premiums and deposits of $10.3 billion, up 45% compared to the prior year. The largest drivers of new deposits in the current quarter were $2.2 billion of fixed annuity sales and $2.1 billion of fixed index annuity sales and individual retirement. In addition, we delivered $1.5 billion in Pension Risk Transfer and $500 million in GIC issuance, both in Institutional Markets. The higher interest rates that have been driving our strong retail spread-based products over the last few quarters are as expected, also leading to higher levels of fixed annuity surrenders. That said, sales growth continues to outpace surrenders in our Individual Retirement business. For the quarter, general account net flows from Individual Retirement were positive at nearly $1.3 billion, up from approximately $700 million last quarter, despite an increase in surrender rates. In addition, liquidity in our insurance companies remain strong, and we continue to maintain a tight ALM profile. While delivering these excellent business results, we also advanced our key strategic initiatives, namely investment partnerships, Corebridge Forward and operational separation from AIG. Let me spend a moment on all three. We continue to see great value from our growing relationships with Blackstone and BlackRock. Our partnership with Blackstone is delivering for our company, our partners and our customers. In the first quarter, Blackstone executed approximately $3 billion of new investments across a variety of asset classes at an average gross yield of 6.5% and average credit quality of AA. Since the beginning of our partnership, Blackstone has invested approximately $11 billion on our behalf, giving us greater access to certain asset classes that are well matched to the insurance liabilities we originate. With respect to BlackRock, they executed on nearly $1 billion in new investments during the first quarter, some of which supported our Institutional Markets businesses. Turning to Corebridge Forward, our modernization program that will deliver both expense reduction and increased efficiency, we continue to advance this strategic initiative, having achieved or contracted on 70% of our exit run rate savings goal of $400 million. And lastly, we remain on track with our operational separation from AIG. Given the progress we have made in establishing our capabilities as a publicly traded company, the bulk of what remains is focused on the separation of shared IT applications, which we expect will be mostly complete in 2023. To date, we have incurred approximately $230 million of costs associated with our separation efforts. In addition to these initiatives, we continually assess our business portfolio as we position Corebridge for the future as a fully standalone company. After a comprehensive review, as announced last week on AIG's earnings call, we decided to evaluate strategic alternatives and a potential sale of our health insurance business in Ireland, which is distributed through the Laya Healthcare MGA and underwritten by a third-party. We believe this will help streamline the Corebridge portfolio and allow us to focus on Life & Retirement products and solutions. Before I address our investment portfolio, I want to begin with a few words on risk management, which is integral to how we manage Corebridge. We have a disciplined risk management framework focused on both sides of the balance sheet. This prepares us for a range of environments, including periods of market dislocation like we saw in the first quarter. We are heavily focused on ALM, which is embedded in how we manage the balance sheet. And our broad enterprise-wide thinking around risk includes liquidity, credit risk and capital management as well as periodic stress testing. On the liability side, risk management involves our broad product portfolio, intelligent product design and dynamic product management. On the asset side, risk management includes an investment portfolio that is aligned with our risk appetite and well matched to our liabilities. Elias will speak in more detail on our investment portfolio, but I want to share a few highlights. We have a high-quality and well-diversified investment portfolio that is predominantly concentrated in investment-grade fixed income assets. We strive to achieve strong risk-adjusted returns while matching the duration and liquidity needs of our liabilities. We derisked the portfolio over the last several years and we are comfortable with our exposure to commercial real estate. Our commercial mortgage loans are senior-secured on high-quality properties that are well diversified by type and geography with strong debt service coverage and LTV ratios in addition to adequate reserves. As a long-term investor with a strong balance sheet, Corebridge is not only well positioned to weather periods of market dislocation, but also able to capture new opportunities as they arise, all while maintaining our disciplined approach to ALM and credit risk management. We proactively manage risk in the portfolio based on our expectations of the future compared to market opportunities. As an example, with the relative strength of the capital markets early in the year, we took further action to derisk our portfolio. We intentionally reduced our exposure to below investment-grade corporate bonds and as a result, upgraded the quality of the portfolio, improved yields and increased liquidity, all with immaterial impact to our interest maintenance reserve. Our positive IMR remains a very healthy $2 billion even after these trades. In addition, during the first quarter, we sold our CLO manager, further simplifying our exposures. In summary, we take great pride in our disciplined risk management, which has safeguarded our operations over time and prepares us to weather many different economic cycles. We remain steadfast on our course in the face of recent events and general market uncertainty. As we look ahead, we remain focused on pursuing our strategic initiatives and financial goals, fulfilling the commitments we made in connection with our IPO and creating sustainable long-term value for all our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Elias."

[Operator Instructions]. I will now hand over to our host, Isil Muderrisoglu, Head of Investor and Rating Agency Relations to begin.

With that, I would like to now turn the call over to Kevin Elias for their prepared remarks. Kevin?\nKevin Hogan: Thank you, Isil, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will review our results for the third quarter and detail how Corebridge Financial once again delivered on our value proposition. Through our diversified business model, strong balance sheet and focused execution, we continued to create shareholder value demonstrated by growth in earnings and cash generation and return of significant capital to shareholders. Moving to Slide 3. Corebridge had a very strong quarter as we grew operating earnings per share to $1.38, a 31% increase year-over-year. Additionally, our run rate EPS increased 13% over the same period. With solid fundamentals across our diversified businesses, our core sources of income grew 4% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Each of our sources of income, fee spread and underwriting increased year-over-year. We achieved these attractive business results while also maintaining a strong balance sheet, once supported by high-quality assets and liabilities, prudent risk management and diversification. We are heavily focused on asset liability management, which is embedded across all facets of Corebridge. Our asset strategy is driven by our liability profile and our broad product portfolio reflects a long tradition of thoughtful product design and dynamic product management. Reflecting our risk management focus, Corebridge had no significant reserve adjustments as part of our 2024 annual actuarial assumption update. Built on our strong foundation, Corebridge continues to create shareholder value through disciplined execution. Total capital return to shareholders for the third quarter was $848 million, including part of the proceeds from the sale of our U.K. Life Insurance business. Moving to Slide 4. Our market-leading businesses continue to serve customers' needs and support our distribution partners' strategies. Our addressable markets are significant and each benefit from strong tailwinds given a large and growing retirement aged U.S. population and a Life Insurance protection gap. The macroeconomic environment also continues to be supportive of our business. Interest rates at mid-durations are expected to remain at attractive levels and new money rates were in excess of 6%. As Elias will expand upon, there may be some short-term impacts from lower rates at the short end of the yield curve but these will be more than offset by growth in the overall portfolio over time. A steeper curve is generally better for our business. Now turning to the businesses. In Individual Retirement, premiums and deposits increased 40% year-over-year to $5.5 billion. General account net flows supported by strong sales volume and improving surrenders were nearly $1.7 billion for the quarter and $5.3 million for the year-to-date, a level that already exceeds what we reach for full year 2023. These straw flows in the general account continued to serve as a platform to drive current and future earnings. Last month, Individual Retirement expanded on what is already one of the broadest annuity platforms in the industry with the launch of our first registered index-linked annuity or RILA. As part of the product development process, we leverage the long-standing relationships we have with distribution partners and our deep understanding of their strategies. Our RILA brings together the most sought-after features already in the market, together with a lock strategy that is exclusive to Core bridge. The product is already resonating with our partners, and we are pleased with the reception to date. Financial professionals at nearly 200 of our top distribution partners were positioned to sell our RILA from day 1, making it our largest new product launch ever. Corebridge now stands as the only top three annuity provider with an offering in every major product category. Group Retirement produced another solid quarter. Excluding planned acquisitions, premiums and deposits grew 10% year-over-year. Advisory and brokerage assets under administration increased 22% and out-of-plan proprietary annuity premiums and deposits increased 17%. The long-term growth opportunity for advisory, brokerage and out-of-plan annuities is significant as 1.6 million of our customers are in plan only. Both in plant and out of plan, our experienced team of financial professionals are an essential part of our success, and we have been investing to further improve their efficiency, resulting in an increase in average productivity per adviser of 15% year-over-year. Life Insurance an important part of our diversified portfolio had a very strong quarter. Sales growth was 14% year-over-year, which continues to outpace the industry as it has for eight consecutive quarters. Our modern approach to new business is a key reason for this success. With our data-driven practices, 80% of newly issued policies are auto decisioned. Building off this capability, we have developed a digital policy application process called Simply Now, that provides a contemporary purchasing experience with the underwriting decision typically delivered in a matter of minutes. This feature is attractive to many financial professionals, facilitating further expansion of our Life Insurance distribution platform. Institutional Markets also had a strong quarter. Reserves increased 20% year-over-year, supporting ongoing earnings growth, and we issued $1 billion of this quarter, furthering our strategy to become a more regular issuer. With pension risk transfer, we see a robust pipeline of large potential transactions for the remainder of this year and going into 2025. As a reminder, we specialize in complex transactions that take time to develop and are not consistent quarter-to-quarter. Turning to Slide 5. We will see the four strategic leverage that coverages is focused on to grow earnings per share and cash flows. The first is organic growth. I just spent a few minutes talking about our strong business fundamentals and the opportunities ahead. We believe Corebridge will continue to grow our balance sheet organically, which will, in turn, contribute to increased earnings per share over time. The second strategic lever is balance sheet optimization. We will continue to pursue opportunities to actively manage both sides -- both our assets and liabilities to drive higher return on capital. To this end, we are expanding our Bermuda strategy and continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our financial flexibility. The third is expense efficiency. We successfully delivered on Corebridge Forward, the first phase of our modernization and expense efficiency program. As of September 30, approximately $320 million in savings have earned in from this program, and we expect the final $80 million to earn in through 2025. Corebridge is moving to the next phase of modernization. We are further digitizing end-to-end processes that support our insurance operations to improve the customer journey and the distribution partner experience. We are also building on the significant investments we made as part of our separation process to further modernize our finance and actuarial capabilities. We are committed to delivering improved performance and enhanced operational efficiency over time. The fourth lever is capital management. Corebridge remains focused on effectively managing capital to drive increased shareholder returns, executing on opportunities with the goal to provide an attractive and growing cash return to shareholders. Next, I want to spend a moment to update you on the progress we are making against some of our key financial goals. First, adjusted return on average equity. Year-to-date, we have delivered a run rate ROE of 13.3%, a 130 basis point improvement year-over-year and well within our 12% to 14% target range. Third quarter ROE represents a 315 basis point increase since the IPO. Second, operating earnings per share. Year-to-date, we have delivered run rate EPS of $3.70, a 13% improvement year-over-year. Discrete third quarter EPS represents a 36% improvement since the IPO. And third, capital return. Corebridge has returned $1.8 billion to shareholders over the first 9 months of the year, and we are on target to achieve a payout ratio of 60% to 65% for the year, excluding proceeds from the sale of our U.K. Life Insurance business. Since the IPO, Corebridge has returned $4.3 billion capital to shareholders including over $1 billion from a international life by [indiscernible]. Corebridge has consistently demonstrated the discipline to allocate capital to growth opportunities, where risk-adjusted returns are the most attractive and where customer needs are the greatest, while also delivering significant returns to shareholders and maintaining a strong financial position. Looking forward, we are focused on growing earnings per share and cash flows and continuing to increase long-term shareholder value. I will now turn the call over to Elias.\nElias Habayeb: Thank you, Kevin. I will begin my remarks today on Slide 6, where I'll provide an overview of our key financial results for the quarter. Corebridge reported adjusted pretax operating income of $1 billion or operating earnings per share of $1.38, a 31% improvement year-over-year on a per share basis. Our operating EPS included four notable items this quarter, resulting in a favorable impact of $0.11, details can be found in our earnings presentation. Annualized alternative investment returns were approximately 7% in the quarter, which were $0.02 short of our long-term expectation of 8% to 9%. Positive returns in traditional private equity benefited from a corporate event and foreign exchange movements. This was partially offset by a mark-to-market loss from one investment in our hedge fund portfolio. As expected, real estate equity returns improved from the first half of the year. Adjusting for notable items and alternative investment returns, we delivered run rate operating EPS of $1.29, a 13% increase year-over-year and a 36% increase since the IPO. This improvement was driven by continued organic growth, balance sheet optimization, expense efficiencies and active capital management. Turning to Slide 7. Our earnings are driven by diverse sources of income that positions Corebridge to deliver attractive returns under different market conditions. And this quarter was no exception. Core sources of income, excluding notable items, grew 4% year-over-year by an increase in each of our sources. Fee income, which comprises approximately 30% and of our core sources of income improved 11%, driven by higher account values along with our growing advisory and brokerage business. On a comparable basis, underwriting margin improved 4% by more favorable mortality experience. Base spread income improved 1% over the prior year, but declined 3% sequentially. The drivers behind the growth in base spread income were consistent with prior quarters. The sequential decline was driven by the impact of hedging floating rate exposures in individual retirement as well as elevated prepayments on higher-yielding assets in group retirement. Even with that, based that investment spread in individual retirement has remained relatively stable over the last three quarters. Looking forward, given the Fed entered into its easing cycle, we wanted to provide you with sensitivities to potential rate actions. Before any additional management actions, a 25 basis point decrease in sulfur would impact base yield by less than 2 basis points in the first 12 months. We expect this impact will moderate as a result of the runoff of the portfolio, additional hedging activities and active management of crediting rates on in-force business. Floating rate assets have been a source of attractive yields and play an important role in duration management, complementing other tools we use to actively maintain alignment of the balance sheet. Currently, our floating rate exposure, net of hedging and floating rate liabilities is approximately 8% and of the general account investment portfolio. A significant portion of these assets back annuities that are outside their surrender charge period. Separately, we have entered into certain macro hedges as part of our balance sheet management strategy. Under the same scenario I just mentioned, any potential impact could equate to less than 1 basis points on base yield. As with the case of any macro hedge, we adjust our positions relative to the prevailing market conditions. While we expect to see base spread income in individual retirement to continue to grow over time, we could see some pressure in the short term. Furthermore, we expect to see continued growth in institutional market spread earnings aligned with the growth in the business. Moving to Slide 8. Corebridge has a long track record of delivering attractive financial results under different market conditions. We are not beholden to any one business or product and our four businesses complement each other. For instance, underwriting margin, which has been a steady and reliable source of income, serves as a natural counterbalance to other sources of income that are more sensitive to macroeconomic conditions such as spread and fee income. Further, when interest rates have declined, asset values have risen driving an increase in fee income and alternative investment returns that have offset impacts to spread income. As a result, core sources of income have shown steady resilience over the longer term, enabling us to generate consistent and growing cash flows from our insurance companies and ultimately delivering strong returns to our shareholders. The combination of our diversified market-leading businesses working together is a key component of our shareholder value proposition. Now turning to individual business highlights, which exclude the impact of notable items, variable investment income and the sale of our International Life business. In Individual Retirement, adjusted pretax operating income grew by 5% year-over-year, primarily driven by the growth in both spread and fee income. Fixed annuity surrenders continued to improve from their peak earlier in the year and were 13% for the quarter. Group Retirement delivered another steady quarter through its combination of spread and fee income. Fee income increased 12% year-over-year. We continue to see this business transition to a more capital-light fee-based revenue stream reflecting the changing dynamics in the business. As our implant customers transition from employment to retirement, we're seeing advisory and brokerage services grow while net outflows continue in the general account. Both spreads and fee income will continue to reflect the impact of net flows and asset values. Looking to the fourth quarter, their seasonality in net flows with raised levels of outflows at the end of the year resulting from required minimum distribution by plan participants. Additionally, we've been informed of two upcoming large group plan exits, but they're predominantly invested in our group mutual fund product, thus having a limited impact to earnings. In life insurance, adjusted pretax operating income increased by 8% year-over-year. This expansion was primarily driven by more favorable mortality experience. In Institutional Markets, adjusted pretax operating income grew by 50% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher spread income arising from portfolio growth. Our reserves have grown $7 billion or 20% year-over-year with the expansion of our pension risk transfer business and higher volume of GIC issuances. Our financial results for the quarter demonstrate the benefits from multiple sources of income as well as the ability to improve efficiency while also growing the balance sheet. On that point, general operating expenses for our insurance businesses and parent company were favorable by 3% year-over-year after excluding the sale of our International Life business, bringing our cumulative improvement from the end of 2022 to 14%. This was driven primarily by expense efficiencies from Corebridge forward. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we expect some seasonality in expenses. Now turning to the annual actuarial assumption update. This year's update resulted in almost no impact to adjusted pretax operating income and is the third consecutive year with limited impact on operating earnings. Moving to Slide 9. Corebridge continues to maintain a strong balance sheet and our ability to generate consistent cash flows from our insurance subsidiary, provides us with the flexibility to act on attractive opportunities and deliver on commitments to our shareholders. Holding company liquidity remained strong at $2 billion, and the Life Fleet RBC is above target. We issued $750 million of junior subordinated notes in September, paying off the remaining $250 million balance on the delayed draw term loan and earmarking $500 million for prefunding a portion of our debt maturing in 2025. Adjusting for the prefunding, our financial leverage ratio would have been 29.6%. Distributions from the domestic insurance companies were $550 million in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date distribution to $1.7 billion, a 10% increase over the prior year. We are on track to distribute over $2 billion in 2024. In conclusion, our diversified business model balance sheet and disciplined execution continue to create shareholder value as demonstrated by the growth in our earnings and cash generation. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Isil.\nIsil Muderrisoglu: Thank you, Elias. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, we are now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Alex Scott of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nAlex Scott: First one I had is on some of the comments around financial flexibility. I think it was specifically noted that you're looking at additional opportunities increase by flexibility.\nIsil Muderrisoglu: Alex, I'm sorry, we can barely hear you. Can you speak up?\nAlex Scott: My apologies. Is that better?\nIsil Muderrisoglu: That's better, thank you.\nAlex Scott: So, I just wanted to ask about the additional opportunities for financial flexibility. I know you all have already done a lot on this front, but I was hoping you could add some context on what you're looking at specifically.\nElias Habayeb: So, Alex, it's Elias. So, as you know, we're very proactive with managing our balance sheet, and we look for opportunities kind of to improve our financial flexibility as we did with our Bermuda strategy as well as look for opportunities creating shareholder value as we did with their International Life operations. The Bermuda strategy is progressing, as we've talked about before, whereby we're leveraging the excess capital we have in Bermuda to support new business generation and individual retirement that reduces some of the strain we have on new business, and that's part of the strategy to grow earnings and cash flows over time. And as we've said before, we see broader opportunities for Bermuda that we are -- that will be explored, and we'll be back to you guys when we have something to talk about.\nAlex Scott: Understood. One of the other things I noticed in the presentation was just referenced that you're generating expense efficiencies beyond just Corebridge Forward, and I was interested if you could give us some more color on some of the things you're doing there and what you're doing to improve efficiency.\nKevin Hogan: Yes. Thanks, Alex. Look, Corporate Forward gave us a great start. And through it, we updated our operating model. We modernized a lot of our IT infrastructure. We moved a lot of that infrastructure to the cloud. All of our IT is now sitting in one version of the cloud or another. We exited our data centers, and we upgraded most of our enterprise platforms, including some of the finance and actuarial platforms in part in preparation for LDTI, but also in part in preparation for the separation. And so, the next phase is actually being able to put a lot of that capability and tools to work. And the areas that our immediate focus are after transitioning much of our middle and back office insurance operations work, we now have the opportunity to automate and digitize that and eliminate a lot of the work associated with it while improving the underlying customer and distribution partner experience. And then we've also have an opportunity to further enhance our finance and actuarial practices. Those are the immediate areas of focus because of the tools that we put in place, along with the investments that we made preparing for separation. We don't have a particular target or announcement of a program in place at this time. We're working through the plan. But this modernization journey is just beyond for us.\nAlex Scott: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Wes Carmichael of Autonomous Research. Wes your line is open. Please go ahead.\nWes Carmichael: Good morning. First question is on RILA. You talked about being up and running with a number of distribution partners on day 1. I guess how are you thinking about the contribution from RILA, maybe in 2025? How long do you expect the sales of that product to ramp up?\nElias Habayeb: Yes. Look, I mean, RILA has been one of the fastest-growing parts of the market over the last couple of years. And the reality is our largest distribution partners have been asking us to provide a RILA entry. And we feel we brought our historical creativity to our version of the product. And frankly, the initial reception has been very strong in the first couple of weeks, but it is just the first couple of weeks. The pipeline is building quickly. The number of producers that have been trained on the product is increasing on a daily basis and we're seeing that pipeline continue to build. And we're excited about the RILA product because has attractive margins. It supports our overall diversification. And it fits within our overall strategy, which is to support our distribution products partners with a range of products that support different customers' needs and risk appetites at different times. And the RILA product supports a different customer risk appetite than indexed annuities or the variable annuity products. And so, we're seeing an expansion of our overall capabilities there. In terms of what it may contribute in 2025, each of our individual retirement products are in a strong position and contribute attractive margins. And so, we see it as a strong complement but aren't prepared to talk about any targets at this point in time.\nWes Carmichael: Okay. My follow-up is on capital. And thinking about Bermuda. And you talked about it a little bit, Elias, but going forward, should we expect cash flows to the parent company from your Bermuda company, or should we really expect you to kind of effectively utilize their capital that is there to support new business from individual retirement.\nElias Habayeb: Yes. Thanks, Wes. So, look, I mean, as we've talked about before, as next pool in our capital management toolkit. It provides a lot of opportunities for us. Right now, we're focusing on our fixed and indexed annuity new business. But there's other products that may benefit from us seeding new business into Bermuda. We could potentially engage in portfolio transactions on the in-force business. And then ultimately, Bermuda is an environment that has been attractive for attracting third-party capital, which is an option we'll consider at an appropriate point in time. But all of these, we look as part of our capital management toolkit, which is designed to facilitate our ability to invest in new business at attractive margins and then be able to maintain a strong balance sheet and provide an attractive and growing cash return to shareholders over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Suneet Kamath. Suneet your line is open. Please go ahead.\nSuneet Kamath: Thanks. I wanted to start with annuities. Kevin, the industry sales have been strong. Your sales have been strong, held up pretty well even with the pullback in rates in the third quarter. I guess the question is, how sustainable do you think not like your level of sales, industry level of sales is as we kind of move from this year kind of into next year?\nKevin Hogan: Yes. Thanks, Suneet. What I would say is that the underlying drivers for the annuity industry don't change with the short end of the curve. And really, the need for people in this country to plan and prepare for their own retirement is huge. I'm getting and getting larger. And structurally, I think that's one of the things that has driven the opportunity. Now certainly, the environment the last couple of years has been very favorable, but it's really the 5- to 10-year part of the curve that's most relevant in pricing the annuities products, the spread businesses. And that part of the curve based on the current outlook is going to continue to allow for these products to be a very attractive part of a long-term savings plan. The second thing I would say is that the adviser community, there's a whole new range of advisers in the last couple of years that have learned about the value of annuities as part of that long-term savings program. And so, we believe that the conditions for the annuity business are going to continue to be very supportive. And so, whether the volumes will continue at the pace of the last couple of quarters, it's really going to depend on what the conditions are each quarter, where interest rates are and where people believe interest rates are going to go.\nSuneet Kamath: Got it. And then, I guess, Elias, on the base spread income commentary that you had in your prepared remarks, I guess, I was hoping you could unpack that just a little bit because what I wasn't clear on is how much of this impacted pressure that you talked about is actually going to happen? And sort of how much of it could happen if the Fed decides to move a certain way. So, can you just maybe revisit that with a little bit of granularity.\nElias Habayeb: Yes. So Suneet, it's Elias. So, the sensitivity we gave to the time there's a 25 basis point rate cut, and we've already had 50 is the impact on us from a base net yield perspective is less than 2 basis points. And to put that in context, we've increased our base yield by over 100 basis points in the last 2 years since the beginning of there. So, there will be some sensitivity that we would expect to play out. That over will be mitigated to some extent with additional hedging activities, the floaters do have a shorter duration. So, they'll run up quicker than some of the other bonds in our portfolio as well as most of the floating rate positions we have back annuities that are outside the surrender charge period. and we're pretty active from a crediting perspective, but that will take some time since you can only adjust it at the annual anniversary date of the annuity. That being said, we continue to believe that spread income and individual retirement will grow over time, but there could be some short-term pressure. And -- but we continue to believe we will continue to grow our earnings per share and deliver on our financial targets irrespective of the rate environment and what the Fed might do.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Krueger of KBW. Ryan your line is open. Please go ahead.\nRyan Kruger: Good morning. One more follow-up on the short-term rates. I just wanted to make sure I understood. Was the message that 25 basis point decline in SOFR has less than a 2 basis point impact on your yield, but then the additional macro hedges reduces that to more like 1 basis point. Was that -- did I understand that correctly?\nElias Habayeb: Ryan, it's Elias. No, the way it works is this is a point-in-time sensitivity. So, with respect to the investment portfolio, the sensitivity is less than 2 basis points the macro hedges, if they don't change is additive. But with respect to the macro hedges, those are part of our enterprise balance sheet management strategy, which we're proactive in managing. We've actually reduced these positions over the course of the year. And based on what the outlook is now, there's a chance that I think we would expect to reduce them even further. So, I would look at the macro hedge as kind of a little different. The only reason we are giving that sensitivity is for a completeness at a point in time. But if you look at the investment portfolio, that's where the true sensitivity is. And every 25 basis points there is less than 2 basis points on base yield, which since the BNF 22, we've increased it by over 100 basis points.\nRyan Kruger: Okay. Got it. That makes sense. And then just at a higher level, I mean, I think you were certainly mentioning other levers you have outside of spread income. I guess when you think about maybe 2025, do you expect that you'll be able to grow just consolidated earnings on a run rate basis in dollars despite the spread pressure you're facing?\nElias Habayeb: So, Ryan, there are a number of variables that play in it. We're focused on growing earnings as well as growing EPS by both the growing earnings as well as growing capital. There's obviously some sensitivity to our earnings that we view as short term. But the longer-term trajectories, we expect to be growing earnings as well as growing EPS through earnings and capital return.\nKevin Hogan: And Ryan, this is Kevin. I'll just jump in. Each of our businesses is actually in a very strong position. Individual Retirement, I think we've explained the difference between the overall dynamic of new sales being at very attractive margins and expect it to continue to be based on where in the middle of the current 5 years to 10 years is anticipated to be -- there's some short-term impacts, as Elias just described. But we see an attractive ongoing condition for this business. In Group Retirement, fee income now exceeds spread income. This is a dynamic we've been talking about in this portfolio sometime. And the sources of our spread -- our fee income like the implant fee asset base is up 10% year-over-year. The advisory and brokerage asset base is up 22% and out-of-plan assets are up 11%. So, Group Retirement continues to, I think, grow its potential sources of earnings. Our life business is in excellent shape. We've outgrown the market 8 quarters in a row after really focusing our portfolio on less interest sensitive parts of the business and then institutional markets is in a strong position. So, this short-term impact on spreads, I wouldn't overstate our multiple sources of income, that's a strategy that we from different market conditions and each of the businesses is well positioned relative to its market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tom Gallagher of Evercore. Tom your line is open. Please go ahead.\nTom Gallagher: Good morning. First question on capital management. Second one on asset liability management, but the capital management question is just, obviously, a very strong level of share repurchase in 3Q. Can you remind us; a, how much you've used up from the U.K. Life proceeds, and how we should think about a run rate heading into 4Q. If I just look at normalized buyback from capital generation, it's probably half of that amount that you did in Q3, but curious if you still have access that you might lean into if there's opportunities in the fourth quarter.\nElias Habayeb: So, Tom, it's Elias. So, our target capital -- overall capital return both share repurchase dividends is 60% to 65%. We expect to cover that organically. The U.K. proceeds were extra. And we've deployed a meaningful portion of the U.K. proceeds in the third quarter. I would be thinking in terms of 60% to 65% in the fourth quarter for this year.\nTom Gallagher: Got you. And my ALM question is, Elias, I heard what you said about the floating rate, 8% of the general account, mainly backing annuities outside of surrender charge. I presume that's an ALM setup to prevent against a rising rate shock type scenario, just thinking about why you would position it that way. So, we'll call it more hedge-oriented, defensive-oriented. Given that we're seeing a change in the macro, Fed beginning to cut rates, would you consider repositioning that or at least hedging it in a way where it we'll call it, maybe optimizes the change in macro here, or are you comfortable just sticking with this big floating rate portfolio backing that block?\nKevin Hogan: Tom, it's Kevin. I think I'll jump in here. Let's unpack it a little bit. So, we always manage ALM and our equation carefully, as part of our balance sheet management. And as interest rates change dynamic changes, that will change -- either the liabilities will lengthen or shorten. And as we saw a couple of years ago, when interest rates started to rise sharply. And so floating rate assets play an important role for us in ALM and helping manage duration. And as the overall shape of the yield curve changes, that will determine the length of the liabilities, and we'll dynamically manage our floating rate portfolio accordingly. But another role that the floating rate assets play is liquidity relative to particularly those annuities that are outside the surrender charge period. And just as a reminder, we never have reinsured our back book, and we benefited from that in the recent environment. We continue to benefit actually from that in-force business, but the floating rate portfolio has been a part of that benefit to that to that in-force business. So, floaters are not purely from a perspective of ALM, but they've been very attractive risk-adjusted returns, and we respond to that. We do have some shorter dated liabilities that they support, particularly in the annuities business, the last couple of years, some of the 3-year, 4-year surrender business has become more popular. And then we have -- we also have the annuities outside of surrender. So, we'll continue to dynamically manage the floating rate portfolio. It isn't just a defensive hedge the way that you described it. [Audio Gap]\nOperator: Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Elyse your line is open. Please go ahead.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks. Good morning. My first question is just on PRT deal flow. I think it's been a little slower since the first quarter. Just was hoping to get an update there in terms of the environment and the pipeline for transactions you see over the balance of this year and into 2025?\nKevin Hogan: Yes. Thanks, Elyse. So just a reminder, we do focus on full plan terminations. We've focused on full plan terms really since 2016. We find the market -- we find the economic more attractive than the full plan term segment because they're a little bit more complex transaction. And there's fewer companies that have prepared the administration to be able to support them. We can continue to see a very strong pipeline of full plan terminations. Because of the complexity of these, they don't land necessarily every quarter. And I described that the pipeline for the remainder of this year is attractive. In fact, we've already landed a decent-sized transaction for the fourth quarter that we've been working on for a number of quarters. And we see the pipeline going into next year also very attractive. So long -- in the medium term, we continue to see very attractive economic opportunities. The pipelines are full. The transactions are moving forward. plans are largely funded and activity levels remain high, both in the U.S. and in the U.K.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my second question is on capital as well, right? So, $2 billion apparent when we take into account the prefunded debt, still a pretty healthy level, right, at like $1.5 billion. So obviously, that's been helped, right, by some of the transactions that you've done. As we just think about going forward, when do you think you might bring that downright more? I think you've spoken in the past, right, to kind of keeping that in line with annual needs.\nElias Habayeb: Elyse, it's Elias. So, as we've said in the past, we manage our parent liquidity to cover the next 12-month needs. And I think you've seen like we've worked through a lot of the onetime expenses we've had the parent expenses are down from over $200 million run rate down to about a $150 million run rate. So that's all contributing to a lower need at the parent. The $1.5 billion that you're referencing right now at the end of the quarter, which excludes the $500 million with earmarked for the early '25 maturity is in excess of that 12-month needs. And consistent with what we've said in the past, we'd expect that to continue to trend down.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Wilma Burdis of Raymond James. Wilma your line is open. Please go ahead.\nWilma Burdis: You touched on this a bit earlier, but could you talk more specifically about the proportion of fixed annuities that have been written over the last couple of years in terms of 3-year duration, 4 years, 5 years, 7 years, maybe just talk a little bit about that. Distributors have mentioned to me that 3-year fixed annuities have been the most popular during the recent period of higher rates. So, I just wanted to see if that's what you're also seeing.\nKevin Hogan: Yes. So, Wilma, in terms of the dynamics, the -- generally, depending upon an investor's position, clearly, the shorter duration products would be attractive for customers that see less certainty in the longer-term rate environment than the longer term. There were definitely periods when the rate curve started to change that there was a lot of uncertainty around there. So quite a bit of the shorter-duration product was attractive to customers at that time, more recently with some broader perspective on where medium-term rates may be, in particular, the 5-year to 10-year part of the curve. We've seen a return to the more traditional 5-year and 7-year surrendered products. And it really is something that depends on the strategy of each of our distribution partners and the position of a given customer and what fits with their long-term portfolio expectations over time. So, we don't necessarily have a strategy of directing towards one duration or another. Our strategy, as with all of our products is to have multiple solutions available, those include both products with income benefits or products that are accumulation-focused or products that are short or medium or long duration. And of course, we've just rounded out our portfolio with our new RILA product, which we're looking forward to further developing.\nWilma Burdis: I think you touched on this a little bit earlier as well, but the environment actually looks somewhat favorable for me -- to me to continue to sell annuities, especially fixed. And as you mentioned, it sounds like you're seeing longer dated products as well. So, is that what you're seeing?\nKevin Hogan: I think the environment continues to be excellent for annuities among our other products. And as I mentioned earlier, the demand is definitely there. The adviser community understands the value of these products, especially at the kind of rate environment that we anticipate being able to continue to see. And so yes, I mean, we're seeing a lot of demand for fixed annuity. The demand for fixed annuity is a little bit more reflective of the immediacy of where rate changes are. But the demand for index annuity has been consistently growing over time. There's a particular part of the investor appetite that still very much appeals to a traditional variable annuity. And then the RILA speaks to a risk appetite that's a little bit more aggressive than would be interested in an indexed annuity, but maybe not all the way to the appetite of a traditional variable annuity. So, I think across the board, the environment for the annuity industry remains very attractive.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Shanker of Bank of America. Josh your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJosh Shanker: I just want to talk about given the strong repurchase activity in the quarter. How much excess capital do you have, not just the buffer you have, but the amount that you would want to be returning to shareholders remain from M&A transactions and just your capital optimization overall? And are there any thoughts at all about long-term free cash flow conversion on your earnings, whether it can be pushed higher than you have said in recent conference calls and whatnot.\nElias Habayeb: So, Josh, it's Elias. What I would say is this, our balance sheet is in a very strong position. We've been proactive in managing it to make sure it's in a very strong position. Our capital ratios are above our targets. Our parent liquidity is above kind of where our parent needs are. We've been pursuing opportunities to improve our financial flexibility, and there are other opportunities out there we're exploring. And when it comes from a capital distribution perspective, we've been pretty disciplined on kind of balancing giving an attractive cash return back to shareholders with investing in the business, which is kind of continuing to grow earnings and cash flows over time. So, I think we've done a pretty good job there. And I think if you look at our balance sheet to date, it continues to be in a very strong position, which is part of the four levers we have to grow our earnings per share and create shareholder value. So, we're in a good position to deliver on that.\nJosh Shanker: And so, I mean if we think about modeling out do you intend to operate above your long-term desired capital ratios for the long term, or do you expect to get those down to in line or in target with the range of your goals for capital leverage.\nElias Habayeb: So, the way we look at the balance sheet is not just looking at 1 metric. The way we look at the health of the balance sheet, as you know, we look at our capital ratios, our leverage profile, our liquidity profile as well as the risk profile of the balance sheet. And that kind of informs us where we want to have the balance sheet, and what are we comfortable with to do or not do. The leverage rate -- sorry, the RBC ratio of 400 is a management threshold that we've set for us from that perspective. But it's just one of the metrics we look at. it's not a bright line that it has to be at 400 or 410 or 380 or whatever. So, we look at it collectively and make our decisions after looking at the collective profile of the balance sheet.\nOperator: Our final question of today comes from Dan Bergman of TD Cowen. Dan your line is open. Please go ahead.\nDan Bergman: Good morning. Maybe just on alternative investment returns. There are still a little bit below long-term expectations in the quarter, but continued to show nice sequential improvement. Based on the prepared remarks, it sounded like there were some noise and one-off items in the quarter. But first, I just wanted to see if you had any initial view into what you'd expect for alternatives in the fourth quarter. And then maybe just more broadly heading into 2025, would you expect alternative returns to be back at long-term levels, or could the higher interest rate environment caused some ongoing pressure?\nElias Habayeb: So, listen, we had a really good quarter in the third quarter. If you look at what's the trend line been. To your point, the returns have been improving. We expect the fourth quarter to be another good quarter I don't think it's going to be as good as the third quarter given we had a corporate event and some FX benefit on the foreign funds that we had invested in. So, our best insight based on what we know today, it will be between where the second quarter is and where the third quarter was. Looking into '25, listen, we continue to believe in our long-term expectation of returns being in the 8% to 9% range. And obviously, as you know, there's macro factors and other things that could influence it. It's early to predict anything right now beyond what's our long-term expectation around variable investment income.\nDan Bergman: Got it. That's really helpful. And then maybe just a quick one on life insurance. It sounded like the strong earnings there were driven by favorable mortality. So, I just wanted to see if you could give a little bit more color on the experience in the quarter and kind of trends you're seeing in that business? And should we expect any go-forward impact to run rate earnings or change in volatility levels from the recaptured business?\nElias Habayeb: So, let me start with the recaptured business. So that was a decision on our part. It made a lot of economic sense to recapture it. And as we look forward, we don't think that adds any meaningful incremental potential volatility, and we think the impact on run rate earnings is limited from on an annual basis on recapturing that treaty. With respect to mortality, listen, mortality can be volatile from quarter-to-quarter and their seasonality around second and third quarter tend to be lower, first and fourth quarter tend to be higher. What we -- if you look back the last couple of years, we've been experiencing mortality experience in line with our pricing expectations or better from there. But quarter-to-quarter, there could be volatility more to mortality.\nKevin Hogan: Yes. What I would say -- I would just add, look, I mean, we've worked hard in the Life business. We're very comfortable with the product range that we're focusing on right now, which is less interest sensitive. We've made investments in our digital and automated underwriting capability that are really paying off. We've been focused on mortality, not just recently, but for a very long time. We've had a leading term suite for many, many years. And the third quarter mortality was not just within pricing expectations but well within pricing expectations. So, we feel really good about the position to serve the need for the protection gap in the U.S. [Audio Gap]\nIsil Muderrisoglu: So, thanks, everybody. As I conclude today, I want to share a few words of gratitude with my colleagues at Corebridge. This has been a remarkable 2 years since our initial public offering. And thanks to all of you, we're living our purpose every day where we help people to take action to plan, save for and achieve secure financial futures. I'm grateful for all of your outstanding work and your ability to deliver quarter after quarter. Thanks, everybody, for joining the call, and have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Elias Habayeb",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. I will begin my remarks today on Slide 6, where I'll provide an overview of our key financial results for the quarter. Corebridge reported adjusted pretax operating income of $1 billion or operating earnings per share of $1.38, a 31% improvement year-over-year on a per share basis. Our operating EPS included four notable items this quarter, resulting in a favorable impact of $0.11, details can be found in our earnings presentation. Annualized alternative investment returns were approximately 7% in the quarter, which were $0.02 short of our long-term expectation of 8% to 9%. Positive returns in traditional private equity benefited from a corporate event and foreign exchange movements. This was partially offset by a mark-to-market loss from one investment in our hedge fund portfolio. As expected, real estate equity returns improved from the first half of the year. Adjusting for notable items and alternative investment returns, we delivered run rate operating EPS of $1.29, a 13% increase year-over-year and a 36% increase since the IPO. This improvement was driven by continued organic growth, balance sheet optimization, expense efficiencies and active capital management. Turning to Slide 7. Our earnings are driven by diverse sources of income that positions Corebridge to deliver attractive returns under different market conditions. And this quarter was no exception. Core sources of income, excluding notable items, grew 4% year-over-year by an increase in each of our sources. Fee income, which comprises approximately 30% and of our core sources of income improved 11%, driven by higher account values along with our growing advisory and brokerage business. On a comparable basis, underwriting margin improved 4% by more favorable mortality experience. Base spread income improved 1% over the prior year, but declined 3% sequentially. The drivers behind the growth in base spread income were consistent with prior quarters. The sequential decline was driven by the impact of hedging floating rate exposures in individual retirement as well as elevated prepayments on higher-yielding assets in group retirement. Even with that, based that investment spread in individual retirement has remained relatively stable over the last three quarters. Looking forward, given the Fed entered into its easing cycle, we wanted to provide you with sensitivities to potential rate actions. Before any additional management actions, a 25 basis point decrease in sulfur would impact base yield by less than 2 basis points in the first 12 months. We expect this impact will moderate as a result of the runoff of the portfolio, additional hedging activities and active management of crediting rates on in-force business. Floating rate assets have been a source of attractive yields and play an important role in duration management, complementing other tools we use to actively maintain alignment of the balance sheet. Currently, our floating rate exposure, net of hedging and floating rate liabilities is approximately 8% and of the general account investment portfolio. A significant portion of these assets back annuities that are outside their surrender charge period. Separately, we have entered into certain macro hedges as part of our balance sheet management strategy. Under the same scenario I just mentioned, any potential impact could equate to less than 1 basis points on base yield. As with the case of any macro hedge, we adjust our positions relative to the prevailing market conditions. While we expect to see base spread income in individual retirement to continue to grow over time, we could see some pressure in the short term. Furthermore, we expect to see continued growth in institutional market spread earnings aligned with the growth in the business. Moving to Slide 8. Corebridge has a long track record of delivering attractive financial results under different market conditions. We are not beholden to any one business or product and our four businesses complement each other. For instance, underwriting margin, which has been a steady and reliable source of income, serves as a natural counterbalance to other sources of income that are more sensitive to macroeconomic conditions such as spread and fee income. Further, when interest rates have declined, asset values have risen driving an increase in fee income and alternative investment returns that have offset impacts to spread income. As a result, core sources of income have shown steady resilience over the longer term, enabling us to generate consistent and growing cash flows from our insurance companies and ultimately delivering strong returns to our shareholders. The combination of our diversified market-leading businesses working together is a key component of our shareholder value proposition. Now turning to individual business highlights, which exclude the impact of notable items, variable investment income and the sale of our International Life business. In Individual Retirement, adjusted pretax operating income grew by 5% year-over-year, primarily driven by the growth in both spread and fee income. Fixed annuity surrenders continued to improve from their peak earlier in the year and were 13% for the quarter. Group Retirement delivered another steady quarter through its combination of spread and fee income. Fee income increased 12% year-over-year. We continue to see this business transition to a more capital-light fee-based revenue stream reflecting the changing dynamics in the business. As our implant customers transition from employment to retirement, we're seeing advisory and brokerage services grow while net outflows continue in the general account. Both spreads and fee income will continue to reflect the impact of net flows and asset values. Looking to the fourth quarter, their seasonality in net flows with raised levels of outflows at the end of the year resulting from required minimum distribution by plan participants. Additionally, we've been informed of two upcoming large group plan exits, but they're predominantly invested in our group mutual fund product, thus having a limited impact to earnings. In life insurance, adjusted pretax operating income increased by 8% year-over-year. This expansion was primarily driven by more favorable mortality experience. In Institutional Markets, adjusted pretax operating income grew by 50% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher spread income arising from portfolio growth. Our reserves have grown $7 billion or 20% year-over-year with the expansion of our pension risk transfer business and higher volume of GIC issuances. Our financial results for the quarter demonstrate the benefits from multiple sources of income as well as the ability to improve efficiency while also growing the balance sheet. On that point, general operating expenses for our insurance businesses and parent company were favorable by 3% year-over-year after excluding the sale of our International Life business, bringing our cumulative improvement from the end of 2022 to 14%. This was driven primarily by expense efficiencies from Corebridge forward. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we expect some seasonality in expenses. Now turning to the annual actuarial assumption update. This year's update resulted in almost no impact to adjusted pretax operating income and is the third consecutive year with limited impact on operating earnings. Moving to Slide 9. Corebridge continues to maintain a strong balance sheet and our ability to generate consistent cash flows from our insurance subsidiary, provides us with the flexibility to act on attractive opportunities and deliver on commitments to our shareholders. Holding company liquidity remained strong at $2 billion, and the Life Fleet RBC is above target. We issued $750 million of junior subordinated notes in September, paying off the remaining $250 million balance on the delayed draw term loan and earmarking $500 million for prefunding a portion of our debt maturing in 2025. Adjusting for the prefunding, our financial leverage ratio would have been 29.6%. Distributions from the domestic insurance companies were $550 million in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date distribution to $1.7 billion, a 10% increase over the prior year. We are on track to distribute over $2 billion in 2024. In conclusion, our diversified business model balance sheet and disciplined execution continue to create shareholder value as demonstrated by the growth in our earnings and cash generation. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Isil. So, Alex, it's Elias. So, as you know, we're very proactive with managing our balance sheet, and we look for opportunities kind of to improve our financial flexibility as we did with our Bermuda strategy as well as look for opportunities creating shareholder value as we did with their International Life operations. The Bermuda strategy is progressing, as we've talked about before, whereby we're leveraging the excess capital we have in Bermuda to support new business generation and individual retirement that reduces some of the strain we have on new business, and that's part of the strategy to grow earnings and cash flows over time. And as we've said before, we see broader opportunities for Bermuda that we are -- that will be explored, and we'll be back to you guys when we have something to talk about. Yes. Look, I mean, RILA has been one of the fastest-growing parts of the market over the last couple of years. And the reality is our largest distribution partners have been asking us to provide a RILA entry. And we feel we brought our historical creativity to our version of the product. And frankly, the initial reception has been very strong in the first couple of weeks, but it is just the first couple of weeks. The pipeline is building quickly. The number of producers that have been trained on the product is increasing on a daily basis and we're seeing that pipeline continue to build. And we're excited about the RILA product because has attractive margins. It supports our overall diversification. And it fits within our overall strategy, which is to support our distribution products partners with a range of products that support different customers' needs and risk appetites at different times. And the RILA product supports a different customer risk appetite than indexed annuities or the variable annuity products. And so, we're seeing an expansion of our overall capabilities there. In terms of what it may contribute in 2025, each of our individual retirement products are in a strong position and contribute attractive margins. And so, we see it as a strong complement but aren't prepared to talk about any targets at this point in time. Yes. Thanks, Wes. So, look, I mean, as we've talked about before, as next pool in our capital management toolkit. It provides a lot of opportunities for us. Right now, we're focusing on our fixed and indexed annuity new business. But there's other products that may benefit from us seeding new business into Bermuda. We could potentially engage in portfolio transactions on the in-force business. And then ultimately, Bermuda is an environment that has been attractive for attracting third-party capital, which is an option we'll consider at an appropriate point in time. But all of these, we look as part of our capital management toolkit, which is designed to facilitate our ability to invest in new business at attractive margins and then be able to maintain a strong balance sheet and provide an attractive and growing cash return to shareholders over time. Yes. So Suneet, it's Elias. So, the sensitivity we gave to the time there's a 25 basis point rate cut, and we've already had 50 is the impact on us from a base net yield perspective is less than 2 basis points. And to put that in context, we've increased our base yield by over 100 basis points in the last 2 years since the beginning of there. So, there will be some sensitivity that we would expect to play out. That over will be mitigated to some extent with additional hedging activities, the floaters do have a shorter duration. So, they'll run up quicker than some of the other bonds in our portfolio as well as most of the floating rate positions we have back annuities that are outside the surrender charge period. and we're pretty active from a crediting perspective, but that will take some time since you can only adjust it at the annual anniversary date of the annuity. That being said, we continue to believe that spread income and individual retirement will grow over time, but there could be some short-term pressure. And -- but we continue to believe we will continue to grow our earnings per share and deliver on our financial targets irrespective of the rate environment and what the Fed might do. Ryan, it's Elias. No, the way it works is this is a point-in-time sensitivity. So, with respect to the investment portfolio, the sensitivity is less than 2 basis points the macro hedges, if they don't change is additive. But with respect to the macro hedges, those are part of our enterprise balance sheet management strategy, which we're proactive in managing. We've actually reduced these positions over the course of the year. And based on what the outlook is now, there's a chance that I think we would expect to reduce them even further. So, I would look at the macro hedge as kind of a little different. The only reason we are giving that sensitivity is for a completeness at a point in time. But if you look at the investment portfolio, that's where the true sensitivity is. And every 25 basis points there is less than 2 basis points on base yield, which since the BNF 22, we've increased it by over 100 basis points. So, Ryan, there are a number of variables that play in it. We're focused on growing earnings as well as growing EPS by both the growing earnings as well as growing capital. There's obviously some sensitivity to our earnings that we view as short term. But the longer-term trajectories, we expect to be growing earnings as well as growing EPS through earnings and capital return. So, Tom, it's Elias. So, our target capital -- overall capital return both share repurchase dividends is 60% to 65%. We expect to cover that organically. The U.K. proceeds were extra. And we've deployed a meaningful portion of the U.K. proceeds in the third quarter. I would be thinking in terms of 60% to 65% in the fourth quarter for this year. Elyse, it's Elias. So, as we've said in the past, we manage our parent liquidity to cover the next 12-month needs. And I think you've seen like we've worked through a lot of the onetime expenses we've had the parent expenses are down from over $200 million run rate down to about a $150 million run rate. So that's all contributing to a lower need at the parent. The $1.5 billion that you're referencing right now at the end of the quarter, which excludes the $500 million with earmarked for the early '25 maturity is in excess of that 12-month needs. And consistent with what we've said in the past, we'd expect that to continue to trend down. So, Josh, it's Elias. What I would say is this, our balance sheet is in a very strong position. We've been proactive in managing it to make sure it's in a very strong position. Our capital ratios are above our targets. Our parent liquidity is above kind of where our parent needs are. We've been pursuing opportunities to improve our financial flexibility, and there are other opportunities out there we're exploring. And when it comes from a capital distribution perspective, we've been pretty disciplined on kind of balancing giving an attractive cash return back to shareholders with investing in the business, which is kind of continuing to grow earnings and cash flows over time. So, I think we've done a pretty good job there. And I think if you look at our balance sheet to date, it continues to be in a very strong position, which is part of the four levers we have to grow our earnings per share and create shareholder value. So, we're in a good position to deliver on that. So, the way we look at the balance sheet is not just looking at 1 metric. The way we look at the health of the balance sheet, as you know, we look at our capital ratios, our leverage profile, our liquidity profile as well as the risk profile of the balance sheet. And that kind of informs us where we want to have the balance sheet, and what are we comfortable with to do or not do. The leverage rate -- sorry, the RBC ratio of 400 is a management threshold that we've set for us from that perspective. But it's just one of the metrics we look at. it's not a bright line that it has to be at 400 or 410 or 380 or whatever. So, we look at it collectively and make our decisions after looking at the collective profile of the balance sheet. So, listen, we had a really good quarter in the third quarter. If you look at what's the trend line been. To your point, the returns have been improving. We expect the fourth quarter to be another good quarter I don't think it's going to be as good as the third quarter given we had a corporate event and some FX benefit on the foreign funds that we had invested in. So, our best insight based on what we know today, it will be between where the second quarter is and where the third quarter was. Looking into '25, listen, we continue to believe in our long-term expectation of returns being in the 8% to 9% range. And obviously, as you know, there's macro factors and other things that could influence it. It's early to predict anything right now beyond what's our long-term expectation around variable investment income. So, let me start with the recaptured business. So that was a decision on our part. It made a lot of economic sense to recapture it. And as we look forward, we don't think that adds any meaningful incremental potential volatility, and we think the impact on run rate earnings is limited from on an annual basis on recapturing that treaty. With respect to mortality, listen, mortality can be volatile from quarter-to-quarter and their seasonality around second and third quarter tend to be lower, first and fourth quarter tend to be higher. What we -- if you look back the last couple of years, we've been experiencing mortality experience in line with our pricing expectations or better from there. But quarter-to-quarter, there could be volatility more to mortality."

            "name": "Kevin Hogan",
            "content": "Thank you, Isil, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will review our results for the third quarter and detail how Corebridge Financial once again delivered on our value proposition. Through our diversified business model, strong balance sheet and focused execution, we continued to create shareholder value demonstrated by growth in earnings and cash generation and return of significant capital to shareholders. Moving to Slide 3. Corebridge had a very strong quarter as we grew operating earnings per share to $1.38, a 31% increase year-over-year. Additionally, our run rate EPS increased 13% over the same period. With solid fundamentals across our diversified businesses, our core sources of income grew 4% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Each of our sources of income, fee spread and underwriting increased year-over-year. We achieved these attractive business results while also maintaining a strong balance sheet, once supported by high-quality assets and liabilities, prudent risk management and diversification. We are heavily focused on asset liability management, which is embedded across all facets of Corebridge. Our asset strategy is driven by our liability profile and our broad product portfolio reflects a long tradition of thoughtful product design and dynamic product management. Reflecting our risk management focus, Corebridge had no significant reserve adjustments as part of our 2024 annual actuarial assumption update. Built on our strong foundation, Corebridge continues to create shareholder value through disciplined execution. Total capital return to shareholders for the third quarter was $848 million, including part of the proceeds from the sale of our U.K. Life Insurance business. Moving to Slide 4. Our market-leading businesses continue to serve customers' needs and support our distribution partners' strategies. Our addressable markets are significant and each benefit from strong tailwinds given a large and growing retirement aged U.S. population and a Life Insurance protection gap. The macroeconomic environment also continues to be supportive of our business. Interest rates at mid-durations are expected to remain at attractive levels and new money rates were in excess of 6%. As Elias will expand upon, there may be some short-term impacts from lower rates at the short end of the yield curve but these will be more than offset by growth in the overall portfolio over time. A steeper curve is generally better for our business. Now turning to the businesses. In Individual Retirement, premiums and deposits increased 40% year-over-year to $5.5 billion. General account net flows supported by strong sales volume and improving surrenders were nearly $1.7 billion for the quarter and $5.3 million for the year-to-date, a level that already exceeds what we reach for full year 2023. These straw flows in the general account continued to serve as a platform to drive current and future earnings. Last month, Individual Retirement expanded on what is already one of the broadest annuity platforms in the industry with the launch of our first registered index-linked annuity or RILA. As part of the product development process, we leverage the long-standing relationships we have with distribution partners and our deep understanding of their strategies. Our RILA brings together the most sought-after features already in the market, together with a lock strategy that is exclusive to Core bridge. The product is already resonating with our partners, and we are pleased with the reception to date. Financial professionals at nearly 200 of our top distribution partners were positioned to sell our RILA from day 1, making it our largest new product launch ever. Corebridge now stands as the only top three annuity provider with an offering in every major product category. Group Retirement produced another solid quarter. Excluding planned acquisitions, premiums and deposits grew 10% year-over-year. Advisory and brokerage assets under administration increased 22% and out-of-plan proprietary annuity premiums and deposits increased 17%. The long-term growth opportunity for advisory, brokerage and out-of-plan annuities is significant as 1.6 million of our customers are in plan only. Both in plant and out of plan, our experienced team of financial professionals are an essential part of our success, and we have been investing to further improve their efficiency, resulting in an increase in average productivity per adviser of 15% year-over-year. Life Insurance an important part of our diversified portfolio had a very strong quarter. Sales growth was 14% year-over-year, which continues to outpace the industry as it has for eight consecutive quarters. Our modern approach to new business is a key reason for this success. With our data-driven practices, 80% of newly issued policies are auto decisioned. Building off this capability, we have developed a digital policy application process called Simply Now, that provides a contemporary purchasing experience with the underwriting decision typically delivered in a matter of minutes. This feature is attractive to many financial professionals, facilitating further expansion of our Life Insurance distribution platform. Institutional Markets also had a strong quarter. Reserves increased 20% year-over-year, supporting ongoing earnings growth, and we issued $1 billion of this quarter, furthering our strategy to become a more regular issuer. With pension risk transfer, we see a robust pipeline of large potential transactions for the remainder of this year and going into 2025. As a reminder, we specialize in complex transactions that take time to develop and are not consistent quarter-to-quarter. Turning to Slide 5. We will see the four strategic leverage that coverages is focused on to grow earnings per share and cash flows. The first is organic growth. I just spent a few minutes talking about our strong business fundamentals and the opportunities ahead. We believe Corebridge will continue to grow our balance sheet organically, which will, in turn, contribute to increased earnings per share over time. The second strategic lever is balance sheet optimization. We will continue to pursue opportunities to actively manage both sides -- both our assets and liabilities to drive higher return on capital. To this end, we are expanding our Bermuda strategy and continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our financial flexibility. The third is expense efficiency. We successfully delivered on Corebridge Forward, the first phase of our modernization and expense efficiency program. As of September 30, approximately $320 million in savings have earned in from this program, and we expect the final $80 million to earn in through 2025. Corebridge is moving to the next phase of modernization. We are further digitizing end-to-end processes that support our insurance operations to improve the customer journey and the distribution partner experience. We are also building on the significant investments we made as part of our separation process to further modernize our finance and actuarial capabilities. We are committed to delivering improved performance and enhanced operational efficiency over time. The fourth lever is capital management. Corebridge remains focused on effectively managing capital to drive increased shareholder returns, executing on opportunities with the goal to provide an attractive and growing cash return to shareholders. Next, I want to spend a moment to update you on the progress we are making against some of our key financial goals. First, adjusted return on average equity. Year-to-date, we have delivered a run rate ROE of 13.3%, a 130 basis point improvement year-over-year and well within our 12% to 14% target range. Third quarter ROE represents a 315 basis point increase since the IPO. Second, operating earnings per share. Year-to-date, we have delivered run rate EPS of $3.70, a 13% improvement year-over-year. Discrete third quarter EPS represents a 36% improvement since the IPO. And third, capital return. Corebridge has returned $1.8 billion to shareholders over the first 9 months of the year, and we are on target to achieve a payout ratio of 60% to 65% for the year, excluding proceeds from the sale of our U.K. Life Insurance business. Since the IPO, Corebridge has returned $4.3 billion capital to shareholders including over $1 billion from a international life by [indiscernible]. Corebridge has consistently demonstrated the discipline to allocate capital to growth opportunities, where risk-adjusted returns are the most attractive and where customer needs are the greatest, while also delivering significant returns to shareholders and maintaining a strong financial position. Looking forward, we are focused on growing earnings per share and cash flows and continuing to increase long-term shareholder value. I will now turn the call over to Elias. Yes. Thanks, Alex. Look, Corporate Forward gave us a great start. And through it, we updated our operating model. We modernized a lot of our IT infrastructure. We moved a lot of that infrastructure to the cloud. All of our IT is now sitting in one version of the cloud or another. We exited our data centers, and we upgraded most of our enterprise platforms, including some of the finance and actuarial platforms in part in preparation for LDTI, but also in part in preparation for the separation. And so, the next phase is actually being able to put a lot of that capability and tools to work. And the areas that our immediate focus are after transitioning much of our middle and back office insurance operations work, we now have the opportunity to automate and digitize that and eliminate a lot of the work associated with it while improving the underlying customer and distribution partner experience. And then we've also have an opportunity to further enhance our finance and actuarial practices. Those are the immediate areas of focus because of the tools that we put in place, along with the investments that we made preparing for separation. We don't have a particular target or announcement of a program in place at this time. We're working through the plan. But this modernization journey is just beyond for us. Yes. Thanks, Suneet. What I would say is that the underlying drivers for the annuity industry don't change with the short end of the curve. And really, the need for people in this country to plan and prepare for their own retirement is huge. I'm getting and getting larger. And structurally, I think that's one of the things that has driven the opportunity. Now certainly, the environment the last couple of years has been very favorable, but it's really the 5- to 10-year part of the curve that's most relevant in pricing the annuities products, the spread businesses. And that part of the curve based on the current outlook is going to continue to allow for these products to be a very attractive part of a long-term savings plan. The second thing I would say is that the adviser community, there's a whole new range of advisers in the last couple of years that have learned about the value of annuities as part of that long-term savings program. And so, we believe that the conditions for the annuity business are going to continue to be very supportive. And so, whether the volumes will continue at the pace of the last couple of quarters, it's really going to depend on what the conditions are each quarter, where interest rates are and where people believe interest rates are going to go. And Ryan, this is Kevin. I'll just jump in. Each of our businesses is actually in a very strong position. Individual Retirement, I think we've explained the difference between the overall dynamic of new sales being at very attractive margins and expect it to continue to be based on where in the middle of the current 5 years to 10 years is anticipated to be -- there's some short-term impacts, as Elias just described. But we see an attractive ongoing condition for this business. In Group Retirement, fee income now exceeds spread income. This is a dynamic we've been talking about in this portfolio sometime. And the sources of our spread -- our fee income like the implant fee asset base is up 10% year-over-year. The advisory and brokerage asset base is up 22% and out-of-plan assets are up 11%. So, Group Retirement continues to, I think, grow its potential sources of earnings. Our life business is in excellent shape. We've outgrown the market 8 quarters in a row after really focusing our portfolio on less interest sensitive parts of the business and then institutional markets is in a strong position. So, this short-term impact on spreads, I wouldn't overstate our multiple sources of income, that's a strategy that we from different market conditions and each of the businesses is well positioned relative to its market. Tom, it's Kevin. I think I'll jump in here. Let's unpack it a little bit. So, we always manage ALM and our equation carefully, as part of our balance sheet management. And as interest rates change dynamic changes, that will change -- either the liabilities will lengthen or shorten. And as we saw a couple of years ago, when interest rates started to rise sharply. And so floating rate assets play an important role for us in ALM and helping manage duration. And as the overall shape of the yield curve changes, that will determine the length of the liabilities, and we'll dynamically manage our floating rate portfolio accordingly. But another role that the floating rate assets play is liquidity relative to particularly those annuities that are outside the surrender charge period. And just as a reminder, we never have reinsured our back book, and we benefited from that in the recent environment. We continue to benefit actually from that in-force business, but the floating rate portfolio has been a part of that benefit to that to that in-force business. So, floaters are not purely from a perspective of ALM, but they've been very attractive risk-adjusted returns, and we respond to that. We do have some shorter dated liabilities that they support, particularly in the annuities business, the last couple of years, some of the 3-year, 4-year surrender business has become more popular. And then we have -- we also have the annuities outside of surrender. So, we'll continue to dynamically manage the floating rate portfolio. It isn't just a defensive hedge the way that you described it. [Audio Gap] Yes. Thanks, Elyse. So just a reminder, we do focus on full plan terminations. We've focused on full plan terms really since 2016. We find the market -- we find the economic more attractive than the full plan term segment because they're a little bit more complex transaction. And there's fewer companies that have prepared the administration to be able to support them. We can continue to see a very strong pipeline of full plan terminations. Because of the complexity of these, they don't land necessarily every quarter. And I described that the pipeline for the remainder of this year is attractive. In fact, we've already landed a decent-sized transaction for the fourth quarter that we've been working on for a number of quarters. And we see the pipeline going into next year also very attractive. So long -- in the medium term, we continue to see very attractive economic opportunities. The pipelines are full. The transactions are moving forward. plans are largely funded and activity levels remain high, both in the U.S. and in the U.K. Yes. So, Wilma, in terms of the dynamics, the -- generally, depending upon an investor's position, clearly, the shorter duration products would be attractive for customers that see less certainty in the longer-term rate environment than the longer term. There were definitely periods when the rate curve started to change that there was a lot of uncertainty around there. So quite a bit of the shorter-duration product was attractive to customers at that time, more recently with some broader perspective on where medium-term rates may be, in particular, the 5-year to 10-year part of the curve. We've seen a return to the more traditional 5-year and 7-year surrendered products. And it really is something that depends on the strategy of each of our distribution partners and the position of a given customer and what fits with their long-term portfolio expectations over time. So, we don't necessarily have a strategy of directing towards one duration or another. Our strategy, as with all of our products is to have multiple solutions available, those include both products with income benefits or products that are accumulation-focused or products that are short or medium or long duration. And of course, we've just rounded out our portfolio with our new RILA product, which we're looking forward to further developing. I think the environment continues to be excellent for annuities among our other products. And as I mentioned earlier, the demand is definitely there. The adviser community understands the value of these products, especially at the kind of rate environment that we anticipate being able to continue to see. And so yes, I mean, we're seeing a lot of demand for fixed annuity. The demand for fixed annuity is a little bit more reflective of the immediacy of where rate changes are. But the demand for index annuity has been consistently growing over time. There's a particular part of the investor appetite that still very much appeals to a traditional variable annuity. And then the RILA speaks to a risk appetite that's a little bit more aggressive than would be interested in an indexed annuity, but maybe not all the way to the appetite of a traditional variable annuity. So, I think across the board, the environment for the annuity industry remains very attractive. Yes. What I would say -- I would just add, look, I mean, we've worked hard in the Life business. We're very comfortable with the product range that we're focusing on right now, which is less interest sensitive. We've made investments in our digital and automated underwriting capability that are really paying off. We've been focused on mortality, not just recently, but for a very long time. We've had a leading term suite for many, many years. And the third quarter mortality was not just within pricing expectations but well within pricing expectations. So, we feel really good about the position to serve the need for the protection gap in the U.S. [Audio Gap]"

All lines have been muted during the presentation portion of the call, with an opportunity for questions-and-answers at the end. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to pass the conference over to Isil Muderrisoglu with Corebridge Financial. Isil, please proceed.\nIsil Muderrisoglu: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Corebridge Financial earnings update for the Second Quarter of 2024.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin and Elias for their prepared remarks. Kevin?\nKevin Hogan : Thank you, Isil, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report strong operating results for the second quarter, once again demonstrating the Corebridge Financial value proposition. Our diversified business model, strong balance sheet and disciplined execution continued to create shareholder value as demonstrated by the growth in our earnings and cash generation. Through the quarter, our four market-leading businesses capitalized on attractive market conditions and strong customer demand to drive growth and create value. Turning to Slide 3. Corebridge reported operating earnings per share of $1.13, a 9% increase year-over-year. Our run-rate operating EPS, which adjusts alternative investment returns to our long-term expectations grew 12% over the same period. Our collective businesses generated $11.7 billion of premiums and deposits a 17% increase year-over-year. This is the highest in over a decade for Corebridge, reflecting strong customer demand and the benefit of our broad suite of products and services. Corebridge also delivered 5% growth in aggregate core sources of income. All three sources, base spread income, fee income and underwriting margin, each increased. Reflecting our ability to deploy resources where customer demand is the greatest and risk-adjusted returns are the most attractive. Our strong balance sheet gives us the flexibility to both invest in our businesses and return capital to shareholders. We proactively manage both sides of the balance sheet to maintain a sound capital and liquidity profile. We are committed to returning capital to shareholders. And in the quarter, we returned $575 million through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Since the IPO, we have consistently demonstrated our ability to support robust sales while delivering attractive returns to our shareholders and maintaining balance sheet metrics in line with our targets. We are also continuing to improve our operating leverage. General operating expenses are lower by 6% year-over-year after adjusting for the international life divestitures. This reduction, which is driven by the benefits of Corebridge Forward, our expense and modernization program has been achieved during a time of record growth for the company. Expense management will continue to be a contributor to financial performance as we developed important capabilities through the execution of Corebridge Forward. We expect to leverage these skills beyond this program and have shifted to a focus on continuous improvement to further enhance operating efficiency. Additionally, I am pleased to share that we began ceding premiums to our affiliated Bermuda reinsurer in July having received all the required approvals. Corebridge is firing on all cylinders and executing on the plans necessary to deliver on the commitments that we made at the time of the IPO. This includes generating a reported ROAE of 12% for the first half of 2024, achieving the lower end of our target. Moving to Slide 4. Corebridge is dedicated to helping individuals take action to plan, save for and achieve secure financial futures. Through this purpose, our four market-leading businesses drive long-term growth and value creation. Our addressable markets are significant and each benefit from strong tailwinds and given a large and growing retirement aged U.S. population, the life insurance protection gap and growing need for retirement solutions. In the second quarter, Individual Retirement enjoyed strong demand for its products in particular, fixed and fixed index annuities. We have long been a leading participant in these markets, offering a broad range of income and accumulation-oriented solutions through our extensive distribution platform. We continued to enjoy strong growth in the bank channel but also saw significant growth in our broker-dealer channel, reflecting the success of our strategy to support the unique needs of each major distribution partner. Individual Retirement produced quarterly sales of $6.8 billion, up 68% year-over-year, led by our fixed annuity products. Fixed annuity sales were $4.1 billion, significantly higher than any quarter in recent history. Concurrently, we saw the fixed annuity surrender rate declined to the lowest level in five quarters. The combination of these two trends contributed to general account net flows in the quarter of $3 billion. Year-to-date, Individual Retirement general account net flows of $3.6 billion have already exceeded all of the Individual Retirement general account net flows produced in 2023. Touching briefly on our other businesses. In Group Retirement, we continue to expand our range of offerings to serve the growing demand for in-plan and out-of-plan solutions. We are optimistic about the potential for our out-of-plan business, which reflects the increasing need for advice in response to the aging of the population at a time of unprecedented generational wealth transfer. Capitalizing on this opportunity, we once again increased out-of-plan sales which now comprise 37% of total premiums and deposits and expanded advisory and brokerage assets under administration by 12%. In Life Insurance, recently, we have been outpacing the market. And in the second quarter, we delivered sales growth of 13% over the prior year. This reflects, in part, the success of our automated and accelerated underwriting practices. Also, last month, we announced the name change of our long-standing direct-to-consumer Life Insurance business to Corebridge Direct. We are proud to have put the Corebridge name on this business. In Institutional Markets, starting with GICs, conditions were favorable in the quarter, and so we issued $1.8 billion, demonstrating our strategy of being a more regular issuer following the IPO. Additionally, we continue to work through an attractive pipeline of potential pension risk transfer opportunities. Moving to Slide 5. Across Corebridge, execution continues to be a priority, and I am happy to announce that we received approvals from our regulators during the second quarter to begin to see new business to our Bermuda entity. Bermuda provides access to an attractive regulatory capital framework that is aligned with how we approach balance sheet management. Utilizing our Bermuda-based entity presents opportunities for us to leverage our new business origination capabilities more effectively and deploy capital more efficiently, both creating value for shareholders. In July, we initiated our first flow reinsurance facility focusing on fixed and fixed index annuities written through our Individual Retirement business. Our Bermuda-based entity is one means of optimizing capital efficiency, and we continue to explore others. Corebridge has achieved much over the first half of 2024, and we believe our strategy continues to drive an attractive return profile. Our diversified business model, strong balance sheet and disciplined execution enable our insurance companies to generate significant cash flows. Year-to-date, our insurance subsidiaries distributed $1.1 billion to the holding company and Corebridge has returned $961 million to shareholders. This has resulted in a payout ratio of 70%, and we remain firmly on track to meet our full year target. Our financial position is strong and our results reflect the earnings power of our franchise. With positive momentum across our businesses, we are well positioned to further grow earnings and cash flows while maintaining our financial flexibility. We will continue to execute on our strategy and optimize our capital to strengthen our franchise and generate long-term growth and shareholder value. We are pleased with the results we have achieved to date and remain excited about the opportunities for the future. We look forward to welcoming Nippon Life as a shareholder following regulatory approval. To our colleagues at Corebridge, thank you for your commitment and professionalism. I am so proud of what you have accomplished and your ability to consistently execute. I will now turn the call over to Elias.\nElias Habayeb : Thank you, Kevin. I will begin my remarks this morning on Slide 6, where I will provide an overview of our key financial results for the quarter. Corebridge reported second quarter adjusted pretax operating income of $859 million. Our operating earnings per share of $1.13 grew 9% year-over-year on a per share basis. We delivered run rate to operating EPS of $1.21, a 12% improvement on a year-over-year basis. This includes an $0.08 increase from aligning alternative investment returns to our long-term expectations. Year-to-date run rate ROE of 13% has grown over 200 basis points since our initial public offering and is within our target range of 12% to 14%. The strength of our financial results for the quarter was driven by growing diverse sources of income, asset optimization, expense efficiencies and capital management. Moving to Slide 7. Our assets under management and administration grew 6% year-over-year to $394 billion. General account assets grew 8% over the prior year as a result of higher new business volume. And at the same time, separate account assets and assets under administration grew 4%, benefiting from improved account values. The investment portfolio of our insurance companies delivered net investment income of $2.7 billion a 10% improvement year-over-year. Base portfolio income increased 12% over the prior year as we continued to benefit from growth in general account assets and higher new money yields, which were 130 basis points above roll-off yields in the quarter. Base yield increased 22 basis points year-over-year to 4.82%. The Corebridge investment portfolio is diversified and high-quality with an average rating of A. From a credit perspective, our portfolio inclusive of commercial real estate exposure is performing as expected. Asset originations continued to benefit from our internal origination capabilities as well as our partnerships with BlackRock and Blackstone. Given our market outlook, we accelerated the origination of attractive assets in the first half of the year. We originated approximately $19 billion of high-quality assets for the general account roughly 58% more than this time a year ago, demonstrating the capabilities of our asset origination model. As part of our active management, we continue to reposition the portfolio to better align our ALM profile, improve return on capital and enhance credit quality. Year-to-date, Corebridge has sold $4 billion of assets. This includes $900 million of below investment grade credit without any impact to future earnings. Variable investment income declined over the prior year, broadly driven by alternative investments. Positive returns in traditional private equity and hedge funds were partially offset by mark-to-market losses in real estate equity annualized alternative returns were approximately 4% in the quarter, which is below our long-term expectation of 8% to 9%, but better than recent quarters. Looking forward, we believe real estate equity returns may improve from the lows of the first half of 2024, while initial information for the third quarter indicate some potential losses in our hedge fund portfolio as well as on call and tender activity. Turning to Slide 8. Our businesses at Corebridge create multiple and complementary sources of income. Our aggregate core sources of income grew 5% year-over-year, driven by an increase in each of the three sources. Base spread income grew 3% over the prior year, driven by general account portfolio growth and sustained higher new money yields partially offset by higher average cost of funds as a result of surrender activity. Fee income improved 8% over the prior year, driven by higher account values along with our growing advisory and brokerage business, which has increased assets under administration by 12% year-over-year. Underwriting margin, excluding variable investment income and the sale of our international life business improved 4% over the prior year, driven by more favorable mortality experience. The combination of our diversified market-leading businesses working together powers our earnings growth. Here are a few highlights. Individual Retirement grew its sources of income by 7% year-over-year through a combination of spread and fee income. Base spread income increased largely as a result of general account asset growth driven by strong new business volume. Spreads from the new business continues to be attractive but are tighter than the spreads on the in-force. And surrenders are more concentrated in blocks with lower cost of funds, both of which put pressure on the portfolio's overall base net investment spread. As such, we expect marginal compression in the future. That said, base net investment spread was flat on a sequential basis after adjusting for notable items in the first quarter. As we discussed during our February 2024 earnings call, we expect base spread income on a dollar basis will continue to grow, notwithstanding some spread compression. Fee income, which accounts for 30% of Individual Retirement sources of income increased 10% year-over-year. Touching briefly on our other businesses. Group Retirement generated consistent earnings benefiting from the balance between spread and fee income. Fee income grew by 7% year-over-year, while base spread income declined driven by the impact from net outflows as our older age customers transition from asset accumulation to asset distribution. Life Insurance benefited from favorable overall mortality experience, with our domestic business reporting an underwriting margin ratio of 36.5% for the second quarter of 2024, and up 130 basis points over the prior year. As a reminder, with the sale of the UK life business this quarter, Life Insurance's financial results now purely represent our domestic business. Institutional markets produces income from spreads, fee and underwriting margin. Base spread income increased 8% year-over-year, due in part to the significant growth in our PRT and GIC portfolios. We continue to expect meaningful opportunities to further expand this business, which we believe will lead to ongoing growth of reserves and earnings. Our financial results for the quarter demonstrate the benefits from our multiple sources of income as well as the ability to improve efficiency while also growing the balance sheet. On that point, general operating expenses for our Insurance businesses and parent company were lower by 6% after excluding the sale of our international life business. To date, more than $280 million of savings from Corebridge Forward have earned into our results. Moving to Slide 9. Corebridge continues to maintain a strong balance sheet while our sound financial performance and consistent cash flow generation delivers value to shareholders. Our holding company liquidity remained strong at $1.9 billion, and our Life Fleet RBC ratio is above target. Distributions from our Insurance companies were $500 million in the second quarter, bringing the year-to-date distributions to $1.1 billion, a 10% increase over the prior year. As a reminder, in the quarter, we received $550 million in net proceeds from the sale of our U.K. business. Corebridge delivered $139 million of dividends and $436 million of share repurchases to shareholders in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date payout ratio to 70%. As of July 31, we repurchased over $250 million worth of shares, bringing our share repurchases to approximately $940 million over the first seven months of the year. We're disciplined with our capital management and expect to distribute the remaining proceeds from the sale of our UK life business to shareholders during the second half of the year. In conclusion, our diversified business model, strong balance sheet and disciplined execution continue to create shareholder value as demonstrated by the growth in our earnings and cash generation. With that, I will now turn the call back to Isil.\nIsil Muderrisoglu: Thank you, Elias. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, we are now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse, your line is now open.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks, good morning. My first question is just on Bermuda. Now that you guys have started ceding business there. Could you just give us kind of the lay of the land, what you expect to see and how we could see that transpiring? And then can you help us think through the capital efficiencies that you could see from ceding more business to Bermuda?\nKevin Hogan : Yeah. Thanks, Elyse. Look, we think of Bermuda as an extension of our capital management tool kit. We have an existing entity that has capital -- and we did begin ceding part of our very robust fixed annuity and index annuity new sales. We have several opportunities as we advance with our Bermuda strategy. We can see flow reinsurance on additional products relative to new business, those that are attractive in the Bermuda environment. And ultimately, we can also create in-force transactions in terms of portfolio reinsurance opportunities. And so right now, with the robust fixed and indexed annuity sales that's helped us support those sales, but we see Bermuda as a long-term extension of our capital management strategy.\nElyse Greenspan: And then maybe my second question is picking up on that. You guys had pretty strong fixed annuity sales in the quarter. Can you just kind of comment on the outlook that you would expect from here over the balance of the year and into next year as well?\nKevin Hogan : Yeah, sure. So the second quarter conditions were very strong for both fixed and indexed annuities, in particular, fixed annuities. These products are very valuable to customers as part of a long-term savings plan, and we've seen advisers very supportive, both in the bank channel and also the increasingly active broker-dealer channel. And ultimately, customer demand is driven by crediting rates, which reflects where yields and spreads are, but also where customer expectations of the future are. And during the second quarter, the first two months rates were rising and high that started tailing off towards the last month of the quarter. We were able to leverage our responsive pricing and the tremendous distribution access that we have and executed effectively in that environment. We benefited from some operational improvements that we made last year to support the volumes and attractive assets were available. So we feel good about our execution during the quarter. We may not always have quarters in the retail business such as that. But if the customer demands are consistent and markets are supportive, certainly, we have the opportunity to be able to participate. I think you have to look maybe broader than just focusing on one or two products. Since the second quarter of last year, we've enjoyed increase in the overall level of production. But we've been able to support this growth while strengthening the balance sheet and delivering on our capital returns. So we feel good about our execution, and we'll continue to respond as conditions evolve in the future.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Ryan, your line is now open.\nRyan Krueger : Good morning. I had a higher-level question on both Bermuda and your comments on continuing to explore other efficiency options. Should we think of these things as enabling you to grow more while continuing to achieve the targeted 60% to 65% payout ratio? Or is there actual potential upside to the payout ratio because of these actions?\nElias Habayeb : Hey, Ryan, it's Elias. So as Kevin said, listen, we look at Bermuda as another tool in our capital management strategy. And what you see in the way we use it in the second quarter is to fund in an efficient way, the higher growth, which is all going to contribute to higher earnings and higher distributable cash flows over time, which is kind of important to how we think about our strategy. And we will -- as you've seen in the past, we're very active on how we manage our balance sheet. And we see other opportunities to Bermuda which we're -- we got the first one in place, and we're now considering what's the next step on how we further optimize our regulatory capital.\nRyan Krueger : Okay. Thanks. And then with Nippon becoming a large shareholder, do you see any strategic opportunities with them beyond them being just a passive shareholder of the company?\nKevin Hogan : Well, thanks, Ryan. We are looking forward to welcoming them as a shareholder when the transaction closes, subject to the various regulatory environments. I mean, Nippon is tremendously successful in their market, and we'll have opportunities to begin to engage once we have concluded those regulatory approvals. They understand the industry. They're very supportive of our strategy. We believe our values are aligned, and we're looking forward to welcoming them as an investor.\nRyan Krueger : Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Barnidge with Piper Sandler. John, your line is now open.\nJohn Barnidge : Good morning. Thank you for opportunity. Your free cash flow conversion targets. You've done a pretty good job at hitting them. With Bermuda, do you see an opportunity to raise those as that it becomes a bigger portion of the portfolio? You mentioned as a long-term extension of the capital management strategy. Thanks.\nElias Habayeb : So John, it's Elias. So listen, the way we look at it is, as I said earlier, we see it as another tool in our capital management strategy that enhances our financial flexibility. And then we just started leveraging the view that support new business, and we've got some other ideas we're going to pursue over time that will grow over time, distributable cash flows as well as going to grow earnings from our insurance companies. If you look at our -- what we're doing from a capital management for 2024, putting aside the proceeds from the UK, we're focused on delivering 60% to 65% payout ratio. That's what we've done in the first half of the year, and that's our focus for the second half of the year. And the proceeds from the UK would be extra on top.\nJohn Barnidge : Thank you for that. You mentioned -- as for my follow-up, you mentioned other levers improve capital efficiency beyond Bermuda? Can you maybe hit on those a little bit? Thank you.\nKevin Hogan : Yeah. Thanks, John. So look, I mean we're always seeking opportunities to increase value and to optimize the portfolio, including exploring pro forma transactions and any transaction clearly has to be accretive on a risk-adjusted basis. And we look at that from a couple of different lenses, including the franchise impact, managing credit risk other considerations. And we also look at the multiple differential as part of that economic equation. As Elias talked about, we prioritized a few international transactions that were right in front of us, generated a lot of shareholder value there. And now we're enabling Bermuda. And so that does present us the potential, and we continue to explore transactions both internally as well as potentially externally. We are aware of the markets and have engaged in some discussions go further than others, but we'll continue to evaluate and prioritize all the options. We see Bermuda as an important enhancement to our availability of options. And to the extent we have anything to disclose, we'll disclose it.\nElias Habayeb : And John, it's Elias, if I can add to what Kevin is -- since the beginning, since the IPO, we've been focused on creating shareholder value and capital management has been one of the ways we've done it. But I think you've seen the progress we've made on organic growth, where we grew our spread income by almost 30% since the IPO on expense management where we've reduced our expenses by about 11% as well as the work we've done on the asset side of the balance sheet. So -- in addition to capital, all those remain levers available to us, and we continue to be focused on them to creating value for our shareholders.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with Jefferies. Suneet, your line is now open.\nSuneet Kamath : Yeah, great. Thanks. We noticed that the sequential change in the fixed annuity crediting rate was up pretty dramatically. I guess how much of that was the roll-off of, I guess, the old business versus just competitive pressures in terms of new business?\nKevin Hogan : Yeah. Thanks, Suneet. I think a couple of things relative to the fixed business. First of all, we did disclose some one-timers in the first quarter and in the fourth quarter of last year. And when we look beyond the impact of those, our nominal spreads were essentially flat on a sequential basis. And we did see very strong growth in the second quarter, the growth in the general account of $3 billion. And as the business earns in, we do expect spread income to continue to grow albeit at a slower pace. We moved quickly at the beginning of the change in the market, and we were able to take actions relative to the in-force and repositioning the asset portfolios. And what we're seeing is that the cost of funds on new business is higher than the overall in-force portfolio. And what we're seeing in surrenders are the lower cost of fund businesses. So that is creating a creep effect in the cost of funds. And so nominal spreads themselves may have peaked as we've indicated before, and there may be some marginal spread compression going forward, but the margins are locked in on the in-force and we price new business according to what's available now. We expect spread income to continue to grow even though there may be some marginal spread compression.\nSuneet Kamath : Got it. And I guess on that base spread income growth, I mean, I guess do you need sales to be sort of at this level, which is a pretty incredible level of sales in order to see that? I'm just trying to think through what the drivers of that growth in base spread income are?\nKevin Hogan : It's to life. There's two drivers for the growth in spread income. So one is new business. No, we don't need it to be at the level you saw in the second quarter to continue to grow. The second thing is on the in-force portfolio. And we shared with you in our earnings deck, the kind of the delta between where new money is coming into the portfolio and where money is exiting the portfolio. So we had a 130 basis point differential. So that kind of higher reinvestment rate, which still has a healthy cushion relative to what's leaving our portfolio, that's another tailwind for the growth in our spread income. So those two will be the tailwinds going forward, and we expect that to continue to driving spread income into the future.\nSuneet Kamath : Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore. Tom, your line is now open.\nTom Gallagher : Good morning. First question is just on the spike in fixed annuity sales. Was that caused by any new product that was launched? Or was that an existing product that really accelerated during the quarter? And how do you feel about the margins in those? Because I think whenever you see something like a product that's considered somewhat of a commodity like fixed annuities go up so much. There's going to be some skepticism that it's a good profit margin. But can you talk about how you feel about the profit margin on those sales?\nKevin Hogan : Yeah. Thanks, Tom. We feel good about the profit margin on the sales. We manage the pricing in our fixed annuity business with great discipline. We have the ability to reprice all of our in-force products essentially every day if we had to, during the pandemic, we were able to do that, and we're very focused on kind of the micro cycles of competition. And historically, fixed annuities is one of the businesses where our production has varied quarter-to-quarter according to where our customer demands are at a given time in the second quarter just happens to be a period where the customer demand was very strong. Part of that is where crediting rates were. Part of that, I think, is where investor expectations were. And a lot of it was that advisers, both in the bank and the broker-dealer channel see the great value of these products as part of a long-term investment plan. So the conditions were very attractive in the second quarter. We didn't change any of our pricing philosophy and the margins continue to be attractive on new business.\nTom Gallagher : Got it. So Kevin, no new product that was just the product that was on the shelf and it sounds like you think industry demand really probably picked up and you were just catching your share. Is that a fair way of thinking about it?\nKevin Hogan : No, I wouldn't necessarily think of it like that, Tom. I think we have a very strong distribution partnership with some significant distribution partners. And we were able to mobilize that capability in the second quarter in response to the demand. So it's not just a matter of where the market was. It's our business model relative to having multiple products, having multiple channels being able to focus our capital where the risk-adjusted returns are most attractive at any given time and then having the distribution platform to be able to put that to work. And just taking a step back from the fixed annuity business for a moment. I mean, our entire business model reflects that opportunity. And so the fixed annuity sales kind of stood out in the second quarter, but -- if you look at the previous couple of quarters, we've enjoyed growth from various products and various channels in response to that market demand. And so that's how we look at it. There was a very strong quarter in fixed annuities. If those conditions were to repeat, we would anticipate being able to deliver a similar performance that we'll be continuing to respond to where the opportunities are the greatest, going forward.\nTom Gallagher : Yeah, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Wes Carmichael with Autonomous Research. Wes, your line is now open.\nWes Carmichael : Yeah, thank you. I had a similar question along the line of Tom on MYGAs. But Kevin, you mentioned the cost of funds is higher on the overall portfolio versus new business. And I totally get that. But when we think about new business, are you expecting kind of pressure on the cost of funds going forward, all else equal, including like interest rates? I guess I just think about new entrants coming into the market, more companies continuing to focus on strategies like Bermuda, so do you expect that would kind of push up the crediting rates on these products going forward?\nKevin Hogan : So Wes, I just want to be clear on something. It's actually the cost of funds on the in-force is lower than the new business. And that reflects the fact that a lot of that in-force was originated at a very different interest rate environment. And so what's causing the creep and the cost of funds is actually the flowing in of the new business. Now what I'll say is, based on where rates and spreads are, the margins on that new business continue to be very attractive. But that is what's causing the creep in the cost of funds. As the environment continues, I mean, I think even if -- there are some reductions in base rates, particularly at the front end of the curve. I believe that the demand for the fixed and fixed indexed annuity products is going to continue to be very strong. Because as the nominal crediting rates where products are now, these are something that are very attractive and very important to supporting a long-term savings plan as part of its asset allocation.\nWes Carmichael : Got it. And then I think on my follow-up, just on retail annuities and shelf space, you mentioned strong distribution, but are there any opportunities that you see in the near term to kind of get on the shelf with some wirehouses or even some agencies where you expect that could be meaningful in the near term?\nKevin Hogan : So we are already on the shelf. We believe that every major distribution firm available and the broker-dealer channel, in fact, is an area, we saw significant strength in the recent quarters. And that is an area where there's almost a new generation of advisers that are discovering the value of these products as part of an asset allocation, an important part of our recent growth has been the broker-dealer channel, which includes for us the wirehouses.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Joel Hurwitz with Dowling Partners. Joel, your line is now open.\nJoel Hurwitz : Hey, good morning. A quick one on VII. So you guys only called out the unfavorable alternatives, but it looks like there was further VII pressure in the quarter, including negative call and tender income, just what was that about what you see in the quarter there in non-alternative VII?\nElias Habayeb : Hey, Joel, it's Elias. So yes, we had a situation where we had a bond that was purchased during the pandemic when rates were really low, we purchased it at a premium, and it had a call event on it in the quarter, hence, why we had a loss upon the call.\nJoel Hurwitz : Okay. So just a onetime or there?\nElias Habayeb : Yeah. I also signaled in my script that looking at the third quarter, we expect another one in the third quarter. But I would look at those as kind of more limited than necessarily a run rate.\nJoel Hurwitz : Okay. And then can you just provide some more color on your PRT outlook for the second half? And just what are you seeing in the overall competitive environment in that space?\nKevin Hogan : Yeah, sure. In pension risk transfer, the pipelines continue to be very strong. We did not have a transaction in the second quarter, but we focus on the full plan termination space, and there were no significant sized full plan terminations in our market in the second quarter, but the pipeline continues to be very strong. And across the Institutional Markets business, actually, we feel great about our position. The conditions were very good for guaranteed investment contracts in the quarter. We engaged in some issuance there, and we continue to see good growth in the structures as well. So the pension risk transfer is going to be a little volatile in terms of when we land transactions. We do focus on full plan terms in the $500 million to $1.5 billion range. There's plenty in the pipeline, but they don't land every quarter.\nJoel Hurwitz : Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Ward with Citigroup. Mike, your line is now open.\nMike Ward : Thank you, guys. Good morning. Just curious with the gears moving in terms of deconsolidation and internally for you guys with the Bermuda arrangements. Curious how you see your business mix today? Specifically kind of how do you weigh external risk transfer opportunities or business mix changes going forward?\nKevin Hogan : So thanks, Mike. We believe we have a very strong position in the businesses that we've chosen. We have 4 market-leading businesses that are at scale and able to perform. We've worked hard to hone that portfolio over the year, and we're focusing on what's right in front of us. In terms of opportunities for optimizing the portfolio, whether they're internal solutions or external solutions, we're equally actively exploring where those opportunities may be. And weighing them against other opportunities we have to generate shareholder value. We are aware of what the market conditions are. We're aware of what the opportunity is in terms of transaction multiples. And we continue to focus on prioritizing the most important transactions in front of us.\nMike Ward : Thanks. And I'm sorry to keep going back to this annuity sales question. That's certainly a positive result to see growth, right? But just looking at the Limra data and fixed -- industry sales actually declined in the quarter. So I think we're just kind of trying to square this away. And I noticed in an earlier question, you mentioned some operational improvements that you made last year to support volumes. So was that part of it? Or was there a new distribution that really contributed to this growth, while others seem to see their sales decline?\nKevin Hogan : Look, I can't speak for what others strategies may be. I can speak for what ours is, and that is to respond to market opportunities to maintain our pricing discipline and to maintain a distribution platform that we can flex. After the tremendous volumes of the first quarter of last year, we did make operational improvements. We increased our capacity and flexibility, which started coming online in the third quarter of last year. And so we were able to support the volumes of the second quarter, without any unusual service issues or backlogs or anything like that. I think that was part of it. But really, it's where our distribution partnerships were and where the customer demand was. And also, we never issue liabilities that don't have an asset strategy to support them and assets were available and attractive in the second quarter to support that growth. So we're pleased with our execution at that time. I wouldn't necessarily look at it as a quarter that you would expect to always repeat. We respond to the opportunities of any given quarter. And if you look back at our production in fixed annuities, it is -- it's never been linear. It is -- it's a capital markets transaction, and we respond to it in the form of a capital markets business.\nMike Ward : Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That will conclude the question-and-answer session today. I will now pass the call over to Kevin Hogan, CEO of Corebridge Financial for closing remarks.\nKevin Hogan : Okay. Thanks, everybody. Thanks for joining us this morning. Thanks for the questions, and have a nice day.\nOperator: That will conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Elias Habayeb",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. I will begin my remarks this morning on Slide 6, where I will provide an overview of our key financial results for the quarter. Corebridge reported second quarter adjusted pretax operating income of $859 million. Our operating earnings per share of $1.13 grew 9% year-over-year on a per share basis. We delivered run rate to operating EPS of $1.21, a 12% improvement on a year-over-year basis. This includes an $0.08 increase from aligning alternative investment returns to our long-term expectations. Year-to-date run rate ROE of 13% has grown over 200 basis points since our initial public offering and is within our target range of 12% to 14%. The strength of our financial results for the quarter was driven by growing diverse sources of income, asset optimization, expense efficiencies and capital management. Moving to Slide 7. Our assets under management and administration grew 6% year-over-year to $394 billion. General account assets grew 8% over the prior year as a result of higher new business volume. And at the same time, separate account assets and assets under administration grew 4%, benefiting from improved account values. The investment portfolio of our insurance companies delivered net investment income of $2.7 billion a 10% improvement year-over-year. Base portfolio income increased 12% over the prior year as we continued to benefit from growth in general account assets and higher new money yields, which were 130 basis points above roll-off yields in the quarter. Base yield increased 22 basis points year-over-year to 4.82%. The Corebridge investment portfolio is diversified and high-quality with an average rating of A. From a credit perspective, our portfolio inclusive of commercial real estate exposure is performing as expected. Asset originations continued to benefit from our internal origination capabilities as well as our partnerships with BlackRock and Blackstone. Given our market outlook, we accelerated the origination of attractive assets in the first half of the year. We originated approximately $19 billion of high-quality assets for the general account roughly 58% more than this time a year ago, demonstrating the capabilities of our asset origination model. As part of our active management, we continue to reposition the portfolio to better align our ALM profile, improve return on capital and enhance credit quality. Year-to-date, Corebridge has sold $4 billion of assets. This includes $900 million of below investment grade credit without any impact to future earnings. Variable investment income declined over the prior year, broadly driven by alternative investments. Positive returns in traditional private equity and hedge funds were partially offset by mark-to-market losses in real estate equity annualized alternative returns were approximately 4% in the quarter, which is below our long-term expectation of 8% to 9%, but better than recent quarters. Looking forward, we believe real estate equity returns may improve from the lows of the first half of 2024, while initial information for the third quarter indicate some potential losses in our hedge fund portfolio as well as on call and tender activity. Turning to Slide 8. Our businesses at Corebridge create multiple and complementary sources of income. Our aggregate core sources of income grew 5% year-over-year, driven by an increase in each of the three sources. Base spread income grew 3% over the prior year, driven by general account portfolio growth and sustained higher new money yields partially offset by higher average cost of funds as a result of surrender activity. Fee income improved 8% over the prior year, driven by higher account values along with our growing advisory and brokerage business, which has increased assets under administration by 12% year-over-year. Underwriting margin, excluding variable investment income and the sale of our international life business improved 4% over the prior year, driven by more favorable mortality experience. The combination of our diversified market-leading businesses working together powers our earnings growth. Here are a few highlights. Individual Retirement grew its sources of income by 7% year-over-year through a combination of spread and fee income. Base spread income increased largely as a result of general account asset growth driven by strong new business volume. Spreads from the new business continues to be attractive but are tighter than the spreads on the in-force. And surrenders are more concentrated in blocks with lower cost of funds, both of which put pressure on the portfolio's overall base net investment spread. As such, we expect marginal compression in the future. That said, base net investment spread was flat on a sequential basis after adjusting for notable items in the first quarter. As we discussed during our February 2024 earnings call, we expect base spread income on a dollar basis will continue to grow, notwithstanding some spread compression. Fee income, which accounts for 30% of Individual Retirement sources of income increased 10% year-over-year. Touching briefly on our other businesses. Group Retirement generated consistent earnings benefiting from the balance between spread and fee income. Fee income grew by 7% year-over-year, while base spread income declined driven by the impact from net outflows as our older age customers transition from asset accumulation to asset distribution. Life Insurance benefited from favorable overall mortality experience, with our domestic business reporting an underwriting margin ratio of 36.5% for the second quarter of 2024, and up 130 basis points over the prior year. As a reminder, with the sale of the UK life business this quarter, Life Insurance's financial results now purely represent our domestic business. Institutional markets produces income from spreads, fee and underwriting margin. Base spread income increased 8% year-over-year, due in part to the significant growth in our PRT and GIC portfolios. We continue to expect meaningful opportunities to further expand this business, which we believe will lead to ongoing growth of reserves and earnings. Our financial results for the quarter demonstrate the benefits from our multiple sources of income as well as the ability to improve efficiency while also growing the balance sheet. On that point, general operating expenses for our Insurance businesses and parent company were lower by 6% after excluding the sale of our international life business. To date, more than $280 million of savings from Corebridge Forward have earned into our results. Moving to Slide 9. Corebridge continues to maintain a strong balance sheet while our sound financial performance and consistent cash flow generation delivers value to shareholders. Our holding company liquidity remained strong at $1.9 billion, and our Life Fleet RBC ratio is above target. Distributions from our Insurance companies were $500 million in the second quarter, bringing the year-to-date distributions to $1.1 billion, a 10% increase over the prior year. As a reminder, in the quarter, we received $550 million in net proceeds from the sale of our U.K. business. Corebridge delivered $139 million of dividends and $436 million of share repurchases to shareholders in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date payout ratio to 70%. As of July 31, we repurchased over $250 million worth of shares, bringing our share repurchases to approximately $940 million over the first seven months of the year. We're disciplined with our capital management and expect to distribute the remaining proceeds from the sale of our UK life business to shareholders during the second half of the year. In conclusion, our diversified business model, strong balance sheet and disciplined execution continue to create shareholder value as demonstrated by the growth in our earnings and cash generation. With that, I will now turn the call back to Isil. Hey, Ryan, it's Elias. So as Kevin said, listen, we look at Bermuda as another tool in our capital management strategy. And what you see in the way we use it in the second quarter is to fund in an efficient way, the higher growth, which is all going to contribute to higher earnings and higher distributable cash flows over time, which is kind of important to how we think about our strategy. And we will -- as you've seen in the past, we're very active on how we manage our balance sheet. And we see other opportunities to Bermuda which we're -- we got the first one in place, and we're now considering what's the next step on how we further optimize our regulatory capital. So John, it's Elias. So listen, the way we look at it is, as I said earlier, we see it as another tool in our capital management strategy that enhances our financial flexibility. And then we just started leveraging the view that support new business, and we've got some other ideas we're going to pursue over time that will grow over time, distributable cash flows as well as going to grow earnings from our insurance companies. If you look at our -- what we're doing from a capital management for 2024, putting aside the proceeds from the UK, we're focused on delivering 60% to 65% payout ratio. That's what we've done in the first half of the year, and that's our focus for the second half of the year. And the proceeds from the UK would be extra on top. And John, it's Elias, if I can add to what Kevin is -- since the beginning, since the IPO, we've been focused on creating shareholder value and capital management has been one of the ways we've done it. But I think you've seen the progress we've made on organic growth, where we grew our spread income by almost 30% since the IPO on expense management where we've reduced our expenses by about 11% as well as the work we've done on the asset side of the balance sheet. So -- in addition to capital, all those remain levers available to us, and we continue to be focused on them to creating value for our shareholders. Hey, Joel, it's Elias. So yes, we had a situation where we had a bond that was purchased during the pandemic when rates were really low, we purchased it at a premium, and it had a call event on it in the quarter, hence, why we had a loss upon the call. Yeah. I also signaled in my script that looking at the third quarter, we expect another one in the third quarter. But I would look at those as kind of more limited than necessarily a run rate."

            "name": "Kevin Hogan",
            "content": "Thank you, Isil, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report strong operating results for the second quarter, once again demonstrating the Corebridge Financial value proposition. Our diversified business model, strong balance sheet and disciplined execution continued to create shareholder value as demonstrated by the growth in our earnings and cash generation. Through the quarter, our four market-leading businesses capitalized on attractive market conditions and strong customer demand to drive growth and create value. Turning to Slide 3. Corebridge reported operating earnings per share of $1.13, a 9% increase year-over-year. Our run-rate operating EPS, which adjusts alternative investment returns to our long-term expectations grew 12% over the same period. Our collective businesses generated $11.7 billion of premiums and deposits a 17% increase year-over-year. This is the highest in over a decade for Corebridge, reflecting strong customer demand and the benefit of our broad suite of products and services. Corebridge also delivered 5% growth in aggregate core sources of income. All three sources, base spread income, fee income and underwriting margin, each increased. Reflecting our ability to deploy resources where customer demand is the greatest and risk-adjusted returns are the most attractive. Our strong balance sheet gives us the flexibility to both invest in our businesses and return capital to shareholders. We proactively manage both sides of the balance sheet to maintain a sound capital and liquidity profile. We are committed to returning capital to shareholders. And in the quarter, we returned $575 million through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Since the IPO, we have consistently demonstrated our ability to support robust sales while delivering attractive returns to our shareholders and maintaining balance sheet metrics in line with our targets. We are also continuing to improve our operating leverage. General operating expenses are lower by 6% year-over-year after adjusting for the international life divestitures. This reduction, which is driven by the benefits of Corebridge Forward, our expense and modernization program has been achieved during a time of record growth for the company. Expense management will continue to be a contributor to financial performance as we developed important capabilities through the execution of Corebridge Forward. We expect to leverage these skills beyond this program and have shifted to a focus on continuous improvement to further enhance operating efficiency. Additionally, I am pleased to share that we began ceding premiums to our affiliated Bermuda reinsurer in July having received all the required approvals. Corebridge is firing on all cylinders and executing on the plans necessary to deliver on the commitments that we made at the time of the IPO. This includes generating a reported ROAE of 12% for the first half of 2024, achieving the lower end of our target. Moving to Slide 4. Corebridge is dedicated to helping individuals take action to plan, save for and achieve secure financial futures. Through this purpose, our four market-leading businesses drive long-term growth and value creation. Our addressable markets are significant and each benefit from strong tailwinds and given a large and growing retirement aged U.S. population, the life insurance protection gap and growing need for retirement solutions. In the second quarter, Individual Retirement enjoyed strong demand for its products in particular, fixed and fixed index annuities. We have long been a leading participant in these markets, offering a broad range of income and accumulation-oriented solutions through our extensive distribution platform. We continued to enjoy strong growth in the bank channel but also saw significant growth in our broker-dealer channel, reflecting the success of our strategy to support the unique needs of each major distribution partner. Individual Retirement produced quarterly sales of $6.8 billion, up 68% year-over-year, led by our fixed annuity products. Fixed annuity sales were $4.1 billion, significantly higher than any quarter in recent history. Concurrently, we saw the fixed annuity surrender rate declined to the lowest level in five quarters. The combination of these two trends contributed to general account net flows in the quarter of $3 billion. Year-to-date, Individual Retirement general account net flows of $3.6 billion have already exceeded all of the Individual Retirement general account net flows produced in 2023. Touching briefly on our other businesses. In Group Retirement, we continue to expand our range of offerings to serve the growing demand for in-plan and out-of-plan solutions. We are optimistic about the potential for our out-of-plan business, which reflects the increasing need for advice in response to the aging of the population at a time of unprecedented generational wealth transfer. Capitalizing on this opportunity, we once again increased out-of-plan sales which now comprise 37% of total premiums and deposits and expanded advisory and brokerage assets under administration by 12%. In Life Insurance, recently, we have been outpacing the market. And in the second quarter, we delivered sales growth of 13% over the prior year. This reflects, in part, the success of our automated and accelerated underwriting practices. Also, last month, we announced the name change of our long-standing direct-to-consumer Life Insurance business to Corebridge Direct. We are proud to have put the Corebridge name on this business. In Institutional Markets, starting with GICs, conditions were favorable in the quarter, and so we issued $1.8 billion, demonstrating our strategy of being a more regular issuer following the IPO. Additionally, we continue to work through an attractive pipeline of potential pension risk transfer opportunities. Moving to Slide 5. Across Corebridge, execution continues to be a priority, and I am happy to announce that we received approvals from our regulators during the second quarter to begin to see new business to our Bermuda entity. Bermuda provides access to an attractive regulatory capital framework that is aligned with how we approach balance sheet management. Utilizing our Bermuda-based entity presents opportunities for us to leverage our new business origination capabilities more effectively and deploy capital more efficiently, both creating value for shareholders. In July, we initiated our first flow reinsurance facility focusing on fixed and fixed index annuities written through our Individual Retirement business. Our Bermuda-based entity is one means of optimizing capital efficiency, and we continue to explore others. Corebridge has achieved much over the first half of 2024, and we believe our strategy continues to drive an attractive return profile. Our diversified business model, strong balance sheet and disciplined execution enable our insurance companies to generate significant cash flows. Year-to-date, our insurance subsidiaries distributed $1.1 billion to the holding company and Corebridge has returned $961 million to shareholders. This has resulted in a payout ratio of 70%, and we remain firmly on track to meet our full year target. Our financial position is strong and our results reflect the earnings power of our franchise. With positive momentum across our businesses, we are well positioned to further grow earnings and cash flows while maintaining our financial flexibility. We will continue to execute on our strategy and optimize our capital to strengthen our franchise and generate long-term growth and shareholder value. We are pleased with the results we have achieved to date and remain excited about the opportunities for the future. We look forward to welcoming Nippon Life as a shareholder following regulatory approval. To our colleagues at Corebridge, thank you for your commitment and professionalism. I am so proud of what you have accomplished and your ability to consistently execute. I will now turn the call over to Elias. Yeah. Thanks, Elyse. Look, we think of Bermuda as an extension of our capital management tool kit. We have an existing entity that has capital -- and we did begin ceding part of our very robust fixed annuity and index annuity new sales. We have several opportunities as we advance with our Bermuda strategy. We can see flow reinsurance on additional products relative to new business, those that are attractive in the Bermuda environment. And ultimately, we can also create in-force transactions in terms of portfolio reinsurance opportunities. And so right now, with the robust fixed and indexed annuity sales that's helped us support those sales, but we see Bermuda as a long-term extension of our capital management strategy. Yeah, sure. So the second quarter conditions were very strong for both fixed and indexed annuities, in particular, fixed annuities. These products are very valuable to customers as part of a long-term savings plan, and we've seen advisers very supportive, both in the bank channel and also the increasingly active broker-dealer channel. And ultimately, customer demand is driven by crediting rates, which reflects where yields and spreads are, but also where customer expectations of the future are. And during the second quarter, the first two months rates were rising and high that started tailing off towards the last month of the quarter. We were able to leverage our responsive pricing and the tremendous distribution access that we have and executed effectively in that environment. We benefited from some operational improvements that we made last year to support the volumes and attractive assets were available. So we feel good about our execution during the quarter. We may not always have quarters in the retail business such as that. But if the customer demands are consistent and markets are supportive, certainly, we have the opportunity to be able to participate. I think you have to look maybe broader than just focusing on one or two products. Since the second quarter of last year, we've enjoyed increase in the overall level of production. But we've been able to support this growth while strengthening the balance sheet and delivering on our capital returns. So we feel good about our execution, and we'll continue to respond as conditions evolve in the future. Well, thanks, Ryan. We are looking forward to welcoming them as a shareholder when the transaction closes, subject to the various regulatory environments. I mean, Nippon is tremendously successful in their market, and we'll have opportunities to begin to engage once we have concluded those regulatory approvals. They understand the industry. They're very supportive of our strategy. We believe our values are aligned, and we're looking forward to welcoming them as an investor. Yeah. Thanks, John. So look, I mean we're always seeking opportunities to increase value and to optimize the portfolio, including exploring pro forma transactions and any transaction clearly has to be accretive on a risk-adjusted basis. And we look at that from a couple of different lenses, including the franchise impact, managing credit risk other considerations. And we also look at the multiple differential as part of that economic equation. As Elias talked about, we prioritized a few international transactions that were right in front of us, generated a lot of shareholder value there. And now we're enabling Bermuda. And so that does present us the potential, and we continue to explore transactions both internally as well as potentially externally. We are aware of the markets and have engaged in some discussions go further than others, but we'll continue to evaluate and prioritize all the options. We see Bermuda as an important enhancement to our availability of options. And to the extent we have anything to disclose, we'll disclose it. Yeah. Thanks, Suneet. I think a couple of things relative to the fixed business. First of all, we did disclose some one-timers in the first quarter and in the fourth quarter of last year. And when we look beyond the impact of those, our nominal spreads were essentially flat on a sequential basis. And we did see very strong growth in the second quarter, the growth in the general account of $3 billion. And as the business earns in, we do expect spread income to continue to grow albeit at a slower pace. We moved quickly at the beginning of the change in the market, and we were able to take actions relative to the in-force and repositioning the asset portfolios. And what we're seeing is that the cost of funds on new business is higher than the overall in-force portfolio. And what we're seeing in surrenders are the lower cost of fund businesses. So that is creating a creep effect in the cost of funds. And so nominal spreads themselves may have peaked as we've indicated before, and there may be some marginal spread compression going forward, but the margins are locked in on the in-force and we price new business according to what's available now. We expect spread income to continue to grow even though there may be some marginal spread compression. It's to life. There's two drivers for the growth in spread income. So one is new business. No, we don't need it to be at the level you saw in the second quarter to continue to grow. The second thing is on the in-force portfolio. And we shared with you in our earnings deck, the kind of the delta between where new money is coming into the portfolio and where money is exiting the portfolio. So we had a 130 basis point differential. So that kind of higher reinvestment rate, which still has a healthy cushion relative to what's leaving our portfolio, that's another tailwind for the growth in our spread income. So those two will be the tailwinds going forward, and we expect that to continue to driving spread income into the future. Yeah. Thanks, Tom. We feel good about the profit margin on the sales. We manage the pricing in our fixed annuity business with great discipline. We have the ability to reprice all of our in-force products essentially every day if we had to, during the pandemic, we were able to do that, and we're very focused on kind of the micro cycles of competition. And historically, fixed annuities is one of the businesses where our production has varied quarter-to-quarter according to where our customer demands are at a given time in the second quarter just happens to be a period where the customer demand was very strong. Part of that is where crediting rates were. Part of that, I think, is where investor expectations were. And a lot of it was that advisers, both in the bank and the broker-dealer channel see the great value of these products as part of a long-term investment plan. So the conditions were very attractive in the second quarter. We didn't change any of our pricing philosophy and the margins continue to be attractive on new business. No, I wouldn't necessarily think of it like that, Tom. I think we have a very strong distribution partnership with some significant distribution partners. And we were able to mobilize that capability in the second quarter in response to the demand. So it's not just a matter of where the market was. It's our business model relative to having multiple products, having multiple channels being able to focus our capital where the risk-adjusted returns are most attractive at any given time and then having the distribution platform to be able to put that to work. And just taking a step back from the fixed annuity business for a moment. I mean, our entire business model reflects that opportunity. And so the fixed annuity sales kind of stood out in the second quarter, but -- if you look at the previous couple of quarters, we've enjoyed growth from various products and various channels in response to that market demand. And so that's how we look at it. There was a very strong quarter in fixed annuities. If those conditions were to repeat, we would anticipate being able to deliver a similar performance that we'll be continuing to respond to where the opportunities are the greatest, going forward. So Wes, I just want to be clear on something. It's actually the cost of funds on the in-force is lower than the new business. And that reflects the fact that a lot of that in-force was originated at a very different interest rate environment. And so what's causing the creep and the cost of funds is actually the flowing in of the new business. Now what I'll say is, based on where rates and spreads are, the margins on that new business continue to be very attractive. But that is what's causing the creep in the cost of funds. As the environment continues, I mean, I think even if -- there are some reductions in base rates, particularly at the front end of the curve. I believe that the demand for the fixed and fixed indexed annuity products is going to continue to be very strong. Because as the nominal crediting rates where products are now, these are something that are very attractive and very important to supporting a long-term savings plan as part of its asset allocation. So we are already on the shelf. We believe that every major distribution firm available and the broker-dealer channel, in fact, is an area, we saw significant strength in the recent quarters. And that is an area where there's almost a new generation of advisers that are discovering the value of these products as part of an asset allocation, an important part of our recent growth has been the broker-dealer channel, which includes for us the wirehouses. Yeah, sure. In pension risk transfer, the pipelines continue to be very strong. We did not have a transaction in the second quarter, but we focus on the full plan termination space, and there were no significant sized full plan terminations in our market in the second quarter, but the pipeline continues to be very strong. And across the Institutional Markets business, actually, we feel great about our position. The conditions were very good for guaranteed investment contracts in the quarter. We engaged in some issuance there, and we continue to see good growth in the structures as well. So the pension risk transfer is going to be a little volatile in terms of when we land transactions. We do focus on full plan terms in the $500 million to $1.5 billion range. There's plenty in the pipeline, but they don't land every quarter. So thanks, Mike. We believe we have a very strong position in the businesses that we've chosen. We have 4 market-leading businesses that are at scale and able to perform. We've worked hard to hone that portfolio over the year, and we're focusing on what's right in front of us. In terms of opportunities for optimizing the portfolio, whether they're internal solutions or external solutions, we're equally actively exploring where those opportunities may be. And weighing them against other opportunities we have to generate shareholder value. We are aware of what the market conditions are. We're aware of what the opportunity is in terms of transaction multiples. And we continue to focus on prioritizing the most important transactions in front of us. Look, I can't speak for what others strategies may be. I can speak for what ours is, and that is to respond to market opportunities to maintain our pricing discipline and to maintain a distribution platform that we can flex. After the tremendous volumes of the first quarter of last year, we did make operational improvements. We increased our capacity and flexibility, which started coming online in the third quarter of last year. And so we were able to support the volumes of the second quarter, without any unusual service issues or backlogs or anything like that. I think that was part of it. But really, it's where our distribution partnerships were and where the customer demand was. And also, we never issue liabilities that don't have an asset strategy to support them and assets were available and attractive in the second quarter to support that growth. So we're pleased with our execution at that time. I wouldn't necessarily look at it as a quarter that you would expect to always repeat. We respond to the opportunities of any given quarter. And if you look back at our production in fixed annuities, it is -- it's never been linear. It is -- it's a capital markets transaction, and we respond to it in the form of a capital markets business. Okay. Thanks, everybody. Thanks for joining us this morning. Thanks for the questions, and have a nice day."

My name is Emily, and I'll be facilitating your call today.  \n [Operator Instructions]  \n After the presentation, you will have the opportunity to ask any questions, which you can do so by pressing star \n I will now turn the call over to our host, Isil Muderrisoglu, Head of Investor and Rating Agency Relations. Please go ahead. \nIsil Muderrisoglu: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Corebridge Financial's earnings update for the first quarter of 2024. Joining me on the call are Kevin Hogan, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Elias Habayeb, Chief Financial Officer. We will begin with prepared remarks by Kevin and Elias, and then we will take your questions. Today's comments may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based upon management's current expectations and assumptions. \n Corebridge's filings with the SEC provide details on important factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Except as required by the applicable securities law, Corebridge is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change, and you are cautioned to not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.  \n Additionally, today's remarks may refer to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at investor.corebridgefinancial.com.\n With that, I would like to now turn the call over to Kevin and Elias for their prepared remarks. Kevin? \nKevin Hogan: Good morning, everyone. Our team continues to execute with focus, and we are delivering on our commitments to customers and shareholders. During today's call, I will discuss what has been a strong start to the year for Corebridge. In addition to reviewing high-level results for our first quarter I will share trends we are seeing across our company and how well we are positioned for the future. Elias will then follow with more detail on our performance.  \n This morning, we reported adjusted after-tax operating income of $688 million or operating earnings per share of $1.10, a 13% increase year-over-year. We also reported adjusted return on average equity of 11.9%, a 110 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter. Our run rate return on equity, which is adjusted for alternative investment returns that are below our long-term expectations and notable items, was 13.1%. That is solidly within our target range of 12% to 14%. This first quarter run rate represents a 140 basis point improvement year-over-year and 250 basis point increase since our IPO.  \n Looking at the quarter, we see 4 key factors contributing to the growth of our franchise value, our diversified business model, continuing strong sales, attractive margins, and significant expense savings. I will address each in turn and then comment on our business. The first factor is our diversified business model, which includes our broad product and distribution platform and generates multiple sources of income that enables strong cash flows. The wide range of products and channels across our 4 businesses is a competitive advantage for Corebridge, positioning us to perform across different market conditions and prudently generate new business.  \n In any given market, we can capitalize on prevailing dynamics to focus on growth opportunities where the risk-adjusted returns are the most attractive, optimizing our mix of spread fee and underwriting margin. For base spread income, which grew 14% year-over-year, we leverage our portfolio of general account products to meet the evolving needs of our customers and partners. At the same time, we are seeing favorable dynamics for fee income, which increased 9% year-over-year. With equity markets moving higher, fee income is on the rise, rebounding from prior year lows.  \n Our assets under management and administration have grown to $393 billion, a 7% improvement year-over-year. This large asset base will be an earnings driver for our spread-based and fee-based businesses. Underwriting margin this quarter was impacted by onetime reinsurance-related items as well as seasonal mortality. Our overall mortality remains within expectations. \n Our diversified sources of income create financial flexibility, which enables our insurance operations to generate consistent and strong cash flows of over $2 billion annually. These cash flows position the company to deliver on our commitments to shareholders and provide an attractive capital return across market cycles.  \n The second factor is our robust sales volume. Corebridge delivered $10.6 billion of premiums and deposits in the first quarter and $50 billion over the last 5 quarters. We expect demand for our products and services to remain strong, as we are well positioned in the large and growing markets where we compete. \n Further, these markets are favorably supported by prevailing demographics and macroeconomic trends. The third factor is that we continue to produce attractive margins. We actively manage our business portfolios to ensure we maintain strong profitability levels with double-digit IRRs.  \n And the fourth factor, in addition to growing our aggregate core sources of income and actively managing our capital, we have also been reducing our expenses. We successfully completed our modernization program, Corebridge Forward, having acted on or contracted for the full $400 million of run rate savings. While we are pleased to have completed this initiative, we are building off our momentum to adopt the philosophy of continuous improvement, as we are committed to increasing our efficiency over time.  \n Turning to our segments, an Individual Retirement, we continue to deliver strong sales. We remain well positioned to meet the needs of an aging U.S. population and to partner with a new generation of advisers who are recognizing the value of annuities as part of a long-term investment plan. Our sales volume for fixed and fixed index annuities was $4.5 billion for the quarter, remaining near historic highs. General account net inflows were over $600 million for the first quarter despite a higher volume of fixed annuities exiting their surrender charge protection.  \n Turning to Group Retirement. It delivered premiums and deposits of $2 billion this quarter. There are 3 parts to this business: In-plan, out-of-plan and advisory and brokerage, all distributed by our own field force of financial professionals. The in-plan business represents defined contribution plan serving tax exempt and public sector organization. Whereas in the out-of-plan business, we extend our relationship to provide services beyond employer-sponsored retirement plans. Our advisory and brokerage platform supports both businesses where we provide customers access to a range of third-party products or services.  \n Group Retirement is a consistent contributor to our results with a balanced mix of spread and fee income driven by a $126 billion asset base, which grew 7% year-over-year. This business is well positioned to serve the need for financial planning advice, as we focus on plan sponsors that value the role of our advisers. We differentiate ourselves with our field force of experienced financial professionals and proprietary tools that support financial planning capabilities for both in-plan and out-of-plan customers. In life insurance, we continue to generate attractive growth in our U.S. business.  \n Recently, we have been outpacing the market. And in the first quarter, we increased U.S. sales 9% over the prior year. Our distribution partners and customers continue to see value in our select range of products, including simple protection products designed for the middle market and Corebridge remains well positioned to meet demand. With our digital end-to-end platform and our automated underwriting tools, we make it quicker and easier for our customers to purchase life insurance. \n In early April, we announced that we closed the sale of our U.K. life insurance business to Aviva. With this transaction now closed, we are fully focused on life and retirement products and solutions in the world's largest life insurance market, the U.S. This sale was highly accretive. And together with last year's sale of Laya Healthcare in Ireland, we have unlocked approximately $1.3 billion of value for shareholders with a negligible impact on future earnings.  \n In institutional markets, we closed $1.8 billion of pension risk transfers during the quarter at attractive margins. Corebridge is well positioned to support the growing demand for pension risk transfers including full plan terminations, which we have focused on for years, investing to develop what we believe is a competitive advantage, serving employers looking to holistically exit their pension obligations. We expect to continue to see a robust pipeline in 2024, as more plans are fully funded and many companies are highly motivated to act. We also issued $600 million of GICs in the first quarter having become a more regular FABN issuer, and we expect to incrementally grow this book, building on our 2023 volumes.  \n The new business volume we have generated across the company is robust, and we are investing in attractive assets to support these levels. Our asset origination platform put over $9 billion to work in the first quarter, investing at an average of single A+, incrementally improving the credit quality of our portfolio. New money yields remained strong in the first quarter, approximately 160 basis points above the average yield on assets rolling out of the portfolio. \n Our investment portfolio remains well diversified and high quality, with over 95% of our fixed income assets rated investment grade, and we remain committed to achieving strong risk-adjusted returns while matching the duration and liquidity needs of our liabilities.  \n Turning to our financial position, our balance sheet remains strong. We maintain a comprehensive risk management framework and are selective and the liabilities we originate, putting us in a position where we can continue to invest in our business while also returning attractive levels of capital to shareholders. We are also continuing our work to expand the capabilities of our Bermuda entity to support further business development activities. The regulatory process remains on track, and when we receive the required approvals, we anticipate leveraging this structure in 2024.  \n When complete, these capabilities will give us the opportunity to expand our financial flexibility and provide additional capacity to support growth and optimize our capital. This week, our Board of Directors approved an increase of $2 billion to our existing share repurchase authorization. This increase reflects the board's ongoing confidence in our financial strength. And with this enhanced capacity, we expect to have the financial flexibility to continue our capital management objectives into 2025. Looking ahead, Corebridge remains committed to growing our business, serving our customers and creating long-term value for our shareholders.  \n We are executing all of the strategies necessary to deliver on our commitment to achieve a 12% to 14% ROE, 60% to 65% payout ratio and maintain our strong financial position. Thanks to the energy and hard work of our team and with gratitude for the support of our partners and AIG, we remain well positioned to help more people in this country take action in their financial lives. I will now turn the call over to Elias, who will go into more detail on Corebridge's results for the quarter. \nElias Habayeb: Thank you, Kevin. I will address our consolidated and segment results and provide an update on our capital and liquidity positions. In the quarter, Corebridge delivered strong business results and maintained a robust balance sheet. We continue to create value for shareholders. Corebridge reported first quarter adjusted pretax operating income of $837 million or earnings per share of $1.10 and an increase of 13% year-over-year on a per share basis.  \n Our operating EPS benefited from a $0.06 net impact from notable items in our investment portfolio related to a prior period true-up on certain investments, partially offset by onetime reinsurance-related items in our life insurance business. This was further offset by a $0.17 impact from alternative returns below our long-term expectations. After adjusting for notable items and alternative investments, our run rate operating EPS would have been $1.21. \n This was a 15% increase year-over-year on a comparative basis. Corebridge increased earnings by pursuing profitable growth, optimizing investment portfolio returns, and reducing operating expenses. We grew our core businesses and enhanced our financial flexibility while returning capital to shareholders. And we are on track to deliver on the financial goals we established at the time of the IPO, including delivering an ROE of 12% to 14% and a 60% to 65% payout ratio.  \n Net investment income for our insurance companies on an APTOI basis improved 16% year-over-year, while base portfolio income grew 18% over the same period. Reported base yield increased 50 basis points to 4.92%. Excluding the impact from notable items, base yields increased 35 basis points year-over-year. After adjusting for notable items, we expect base portfolio income and base yield will continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace. \n Variable investment income declined year-over-year, driven by alternative investments, which delivered a $23 million net loss in the quarter. Positive returns in traditional private equity were more than offset by mark-to-market losses in real estate equity.  \n Our real estate equity investment portfolio is largely held in funds that are largely subject to mark-to-market accounting. At this time, we expect that overall variable investment returns in the second quarter will likely remain depressed due to continued negative real estate equity returns resulting from higher cap rates. That said, we see a potential path for overall returns to improve in the second half of the year.  \n General operating expenses for our insurance businesses and parent company were $411 million, better by 10% on a year-over-year basis. This was driven by expense discipline and the benefits of the Corebridge Forward program initiatives earning in. As a reminder, our first quarter expenses reflect seasonality arising from higher compensation and benefits. To date, more than $200 million of savings from the Corebridge Forward program initiatives have earned into results. And we expect the vast majority of these savings to have earned into our run rate earnings by the end of 2024.  \n Corebridge continues to maintain a healthy and strong balance sheet, and our consistent cash flow generation drives shareholder value. We ended the quarter with $1.7 billion of holding company liquidity. Distributions from our insurance companies were $600 million. Corebridge has made significant progress toward achieving a payout ratio of 60% to 65% of adjusted after-tax operating income. We delivered a payout ratio of 56% in the first quarter, returning $386 million of capital, comprised of $243 million of share repurchases, and $143 million of regular quarterly dividends.  \n As of May 2, our year-to-date share repurchases were approximately $370 million. Looking forward, we will remain disciplined with our capital management and expect to deploy proceeds from the sale of our U.K. business with our share repurchases beginning in May 2024, pivoting to the business segments now, which continued their strong performance and disciplined execution during the first quarter. Individual Retirement reported adjusted pretax operating income of $622 million, an 8% increase year-over-year after excluding variable investment income and notable items. \n This improvement was primarily driven by higher base spread income resulting from strong general account growth. Excluding notable items, we grew base spread income by 7% year-over-year, driven by attractive margins and new business and active management of the in-force block. Fee income also grew by 11%, driven by an improvement in underlying asset valuations.  \n I want to spend a little time unpacking how our base net investment spread has trended over time. Since the beginning of 2022, we have grown base spread income by approximately 70% to earn approximately $700 million a quarter. At the same time, we've expanded base net investment spread by approximately 85 basis points, largely driven by higher new money yields on investment-grade assets. These are very attractive historical spread levels.  \n As we mentioned during our February 2024 earnings call, we expect base net investment spread expansion has likely peaked, and there could be some marginal compression. For example, reported base net investment spread for Individual Retirement expanded 13 basis points year-over-year, but compressed 4 basis points after adjusting for notable items. There are 2 primary drivers behind the marginal compression. First, the new business we're writing is attractively priced at double-digit IRRs. However, the base spread on the new business is tighter relative to the base spread on the portfolio.  \n Second, surrenders have been concentrated in blocks with lower crediting rates, putting upward pressure on the portfolio's cost of funds. That said, it's important to put these dynamics in perspective. The important takeaway here is that base net investment spreads on the overall portfolio remain near historic high and are at very attractive levels. Furthermore, we expect base spread income will continue to grow over the coming years.  \n Moving on, this business delivered positive general account net flows of over $600 million in the quarter, even with an elevated fixed annuity surrender rate arising from a large block of exiting its surrender charge period. Our surrender peaked at the beginning of the quarter but trended lower continuing into April. At the same time, we saw monthly sales of fixed annuity steadily increased from January and that trend continued into April. \n Group Retirement reported adjusted pretax operating income of $200 million, an 8% increase year-over-year after excluding variable investment income and notable items. This growth was primarily driven by higher fee income and lower expenses. The increase in fee income, which comprises approximately 50% of group retirement overall sources of income reflects that both the improvement in underlying asset valuations and the growth of our advisory and brokerage business.  \n On the whole, this segment continues to deliver balanced sources of income with a near-even split between spread and fee income. Consistent with industry experience and broader demographic trends, many of our in-plan participants have been entering retirement and are transitioning from asset accumulation to asset distribution. As a result, net outflows are typically driven by in-plan participants aged 59.5 or older, and tend to have higher guaranteed minimum interest rates and higher account balances. \n Concurrently, net inflows are dominated by our in-plan younger age cohorts with lower guaranteed minimum interest rates as well as out-of-plan fixed and fixed index annuity sales and advisory and brokerage deposits.  \n We saw 35% deposit growth in our advisory and brokerage business, which is not included in our reported net flows. Reported base net investment spreads for group retirement expanded 1 basis points year-over-year, but compressed 6 basis points after adjusting for notable items. Life Insurance reported adjusted pretax operating income of $54 million, a 6% decrease year-over-year after excluding variable investment income and notable items. Notable items included approximately $30 million related to a onetime reinsurance related items, partially offset by $8 million of a onetime item in net investment income.  \n The year-over-year comparison of underwriting margin was impacted by the sale of Laya Healthcare, which closed in October 2023. Excluding Laya and variable investment income, underwriting margin declined 9% year-over-year due to notable items and to a lesser extent, universal life seasonal mortality which included higher claims from COVID and other respiratory diseases. \n Our traditional mortality experience, which is primarily comprised of term, was favorable this quarter. Overall mortality experience, inclusive of reserve impact was consistent with our expectations. While our underwriting margin was and will continue to be impacted by the divestiture of the international businesses, the overall impact of the divestitures on our earnings is negligible.  \n Institutional Markets reported adjusted pretax operating income of $112 million, a 37% increase year-over-year after excluding variable investment income and notable items. The improvement was primarily driven by higher spread income arising from the portfolio growth. Our reserves have grown $7 billion or 22% year-over-year, with the expansion of our pension risk transfer business and higher volume of GIC issuances.  \n Looking forward, we continue to expect meaningful opportunities to further expand both businesses at attractive margins, which should lead to ongoing growth of base spread income and distributable cash flows.  \n In conclusion, the continuing improvement in our financial results reflects our achievements, growing the business while exercising discipline with our expenses. Corebridge continues to generate strong results growing our franchise value, and highlighting the increasing value proposition we provide to investors. I will now turn the call back to Isil. \nIsil Muderrisoglu: Thank you, Elias. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, we are ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with Jefferies. \nSuneet Kamath: I wanted to start, Kevin, with the comment that you made about adviser awareness of annuities. Can you just unpack that a little bit and talk about where the growth is coming from in terms of channel? And are we sort of seeing this resurgence of annuities over the past couple of years, do we expect that, that will continue ahead? \nKevin Hogan: Yes. Thanks, Suneet. Appreciate the question. The reality is, if you look back over -- up until maybe 2 years ago when the interest rate cycle started to change, an investment portfolio and the role that a fixed income return type vehicles, such as a fixed or fixed index annuity can provide for kind of a low-risk way was not something that was seriously considered because of the very low returns that were available.  \n And what's been happening in the last couple of years with the change in interest rates is that there is now perceived to be great value in fixed income asset allocation as part of a long-term investment strategy. And an annuity is a very attractive option as part of that asset allocation. And so for financial advisers that have been in the business, let's say, 10 years or 12 years, this is the first time they've actually had a chance to see interest rates at a point where the returns available in the fixed allocation product are attractive.  \n And so that's a new generation of advisers that are understanding that asset allocation strategy and embracing it, and also customers enjoying the same thing. So we do see it as a secular trend. It raises the boats for the industry. That's something that is driving new business volumes. Our largest, fastest-growing distribution channels are still professional distribution in broker-dealers, financial advisers and banks. And so it is within those adviser communities that we're seeing this trend, and we expect that it will continue. \nSuneet Kamath: Got it. Makes sense. And then I guess for Elias, just on Individual Retirement, I just want to make sure I understand the comments. So I think you said base spread investment income is expected to increase, but that the spread itself might contract a little bit. And so if I put the 2 together, basically talking about volume growth driving that increase in investment income? \nKevin Hogan: Yes, thanks. I'll jump in, Suneet. We have seen some modest spread compression, and we may incrementally see a little bit more of that in the near term. I think it's important to understand why. So from the beginning -- and this was in the last prepared remarks, right? We executed well at the beginning of the change in the interest rate cycle with our strong distribution presence and our broad product platform. And as Elias pointed out, we very rapidly grew both our base spreads and our spread income.  \n And the reality is that the in-force margins right now have benefited from the reinvestment opportunity with almost no impact on the underlying cost of funds. And at the same time, the new business margins are also very attractive, and the new business sales are robust. So the effect that you're seeing is that the new business, the cost of funds are higher because of where interest rates are now and that's incrementally increasing the cost of funds in the overall portfolio. But the reality is that the in-force is profitable. The new business is profitable, and we do expect the spread income to grow because the general account is growing and the overall earnings base is growing.  \n And the conditions remain good. We continue to be in a strong distribution position. The macro environment is very supportive. The market need is there. And so we remain very optimistic about the business, although base spreads themselves may have peaked, and that's more of a reflection of the fact that we executed well and executed early. And we feel confident we're on a clear path to achieve our 12% to 14% ROE in all of our other targets. \nOperator: The next question comes from John Barnidge with Piper Sandler. \nJohn Barnidge: Good morning. Thank you for the opportunity. In your comments about flows and the dynamic of the outflows being generally older and the inflows being younger. What's the average age for customer and group and individual retirement? Within that, how has that average trended over 5, 10 years? \nKevin Hogan: Yes. Thanks, John. So we track it a little more carefully in group retirement and in-plan business. And what I can say is that our in-plan business in Group Retirement exceeded an average age of 59.5 about 10 years ago. I don't have the exact date in front of me. And in fact, if you look at the entire defined contribution industry, that kind of tracks with the aging of the in-plan business across the industry, not just in the 403(b) and the not-for-profits that we participate in, but even in the 401(k) kind of part of the market. And since then, we've seen an incremental increase in the average age. I think now it's in the low 60s for the in-plan business.  \n The out-of-plan business is a slightly different age profile. And then in the Individual Retirement business, it really depends on the product. The fixed annuity customers tend to be a little bit older. The variable annuity customers kind of in the middle and then the index annuity customers maybe a little bit younger. So between 50 and 70 is, I think, where we'd see the average ages across the Individual Retirement portfolio, but we can get back with some more specific numbers. \nJohn Barnidge: That's been really helpful. And my follow-up, there was a final DOL rule, do you have any initial thoughts on how that may impact your business? \nKevin Hogan: Yes. So the final guidance has now been released. It is effective in September of 2024. And then there's like 12 months for the advisers to be able to implement the new prohibited transaction exemptions. I guess what I'd say is, look, we're in a highly regulated business. We are -- we understand our obligations. We'll be prepared to implement what is necessary. The industry has essentially implemented something like this before, and we did as well, and we're prepared to do so again.  \n What I would say is that for individual retirement, our business really grew up in the registered world. And as I mentioned earlier, most of our largest distribution channels are professional distribution like representatives of broker-dealers or banks. And so 90% of our Individual Retirement distribution and 100% of our Group Retirement distribution through VFA, they are familiar already with the fundamentals of the SEC's Reg BI or NAIC's version of that best interest parameter and so are largely already adhering to many of those principles.  \n In the Individual Retirement business, we have a small participation in the IMO channel. But it is an important channel because it reaches a different demographic, and it's something that strategically we're trying to develop. So we're still studying the final rule. We'll be prepared to implement it.  We think it's important to have a common standard of care that everyone understands and that there will be accessed for financial education. But most of our distribution are familiar with the requirements of our best interest type standard. \nOperator: The next question comes from Wes Carmichael with Autonomous Research. \nWesley Carmichael: I really just wanted to kind of dig in more on the notable item around investments. It was material in this quarter, and it was pretty big last time, too. So can you share some more detail because, I mean, especially like an Individual Retirement, making that adjustment, I think kind of has a pretty significant impact on the cadence of base spreads there ex-NII. So can you just give us a little more detail? I know you said it was a prior period adjustment, but any additional color would be helpful? \nElias Habayeb: Happy to, and it's Elias. So what I'd say is both items are somewhat related. They identified as part of our work to convert into a new system. And they relate to true-up on historical net investment income where we under reported historically over several years. And they are onetime of nature and that's why we're calling them out from there. \nWesley Carmichael: Okay. And maybe just, Kevin, can you give us any updated thoughts on risk transfer strategic actions with the portfolio? I know you said that you were kind of looking at everything and private equity interest has been somewhat elevated. So if you could give us an update there, that would be great. \nKevin Hogan: Yes, sure. Thanks, Wes. Nice to hear from you. So as I've said, we regularly review opportunities to increase the value and optimize our portfolio. We're very familiar with the process. We demonstrated our ability to execute when we created Fortitude Re. We did prioritize the sale of our international operations, and we feel great about the $1.3 billion in value we created there.  \n As we mentioned recently, we are working to expand the capability of our Bermuda entity, and we're making good progress there. And that's something that is an opportunity that we can leverage relative to both our new business in terms of supporting growth or capital efficiency. But we're also evaluating external transaction potential, and we understand the opportunities there. So we're evaluating all the options, any transaction that we do will be attractive to the company and to our shareholders. And we will provide an update at the time that we have any news. \nOperator: The next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. \nElyse Greenspan: My first question is on share buyback. You guys said that you're going to start buying back the proceeds from the U.K. Life transaction starting in May. So should we just think about an elevated run rate relative to normal, maybe in the Q2 and the Q3 as you buyback that 550 million? Or just can you give us a base case on buyback expectations? \nKevin Hogan: Yes. So look, Elyse, I'll start with just some general comments about our capital management philosophy and then I'll hand it over to Elias with respect to the options in front of us. But we have a very clear capital management strategy, and we are committed to executing it with discipline that starts with, frankly, building a company that has a strong balance sheet, consistent cash flows and a nimble business model. And we are committed to delivering that 60% to 65% payout ratio on an ongoing basis without necessarily the need for specific transactions.  \n But when we do have transactions that generate excess capital, we look at the options in front of us in terms of the best way to distribute that, largely focusing now on kind of open market repurchases. We have stated that the U.K. Life proceeds will be targeted for repurchases. And there are a number of options in front of us. And I'll ask Elias to comment on that. \nElias Habayeb: Yes. Elyse, it's Elias. So as Kevin said, our base case will be to use the proceeds for open market repurchases. Our philosophy around that is we want to be consistent in the market, and we're mindful of where the trading volumes are. So that's going to inform how much we will do at any point in time. \nElyse Greenspan: And then my second question, you guys seem pretty positive in your prepared remarks about the opportunity for PRT transactions and the pipeline there. Can you just give us a sense of how deal activity could trend over the remainder of the year. \nKevin Hogan: Yes. Thanks, Elyse. The marketplace for pension risk transfer is very well positioned right now with where interest rates -- with interest rates are, a lot of plans are fully funded and companies that have been thinking about this for some time are prepared to ask and -- so companies are prepared to ask. And then for those companies that may be surprised a little bit by the fact that they are fully funded are also moving very, very quickly to not miss the opportunity. \n We focus on full plan terminations. We focused on that market for some time, which are a little bit more complex. We focus on medium to larger-sized transactions. \n And we've built the capabilities necessary to support all the optionality in full plan terminations. And the reality is, is that the pipeline, both in the U.S. and the U.K., where we act as a reinsurer for full plan terminations is as strong as we've seen it. Think the market volumes this year are expected to be at or above where they were last year. \n But what I'll say is that it's hard to project the run rate because these transactions are highly complex and episodic. We underwrite that each one of them is if they were an M&A transaction. You're buying a sort of mini balance sheet. You have to understand both the liability and the asset side. \n So we have a very large pipeline of medium to large transactions. And ultimately, we'll be most focused on the economics of any given transaction and ensuring that we're delivering accretive outcomes for our portfolio. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Krueger with KBW. \nRyan Krueger: Good morning. I had a follow-up on the trajectory of base spread. So it sounds like you expect some further compression near term. Was that comment specifically about individual retirement? Or is that something you'd also expect in group retirement and institutional as well? \nElias Habayeb: Ryan, it's Elias. So from here, there could be some more marginal compression. It's not going to be a lot in individual retirement. But the key thing for us is we're going to be growing earnings in that business. It's part sales, but it's partly higher reinvestments on the business. So you go back to Kevin's earlier comments, we expect growth in spread products given the current outlook. \n We're reinvesting money at much higher levels than where assets are rolling out of the portfolio. But there's a bit of a headwind on the cost of funds for the reasons Kevin articulated, but earnings is going to grow big spreads. Will be flattish to maybe marginally down. \n And on group, kind of similar, dynamics are a little different, but similar, flat to maybe slightly down from here. \nRyan Krueger: Got it... \nKevin Hogan: Yes. Sorry -- Ryan, sorry. I just wanted to add on. Like we are talking incremental marginal spread compression, not significant spread compression as the cost of funds increase. So -- and that's the reason that what we're really focused on, is the fact that the spread income is in the base that generates the spread income. We expect to continue to grow, in particular, in individual retirement. \nRyan Krueger: Got it. And then in institutional, it looks like if we adjust for the normalizing items, the earnings run rate has been -- has stepped up to about $140 million to $145 million in the last couple of quarters. Is that a reasonable kind of baseline to grow off of going forward? \nElias Habayeb: You're normalizing, Ryan, to the run rate kind of on alternatives in that estimate, correct? \nRyan Krueger: Correct, yes. \nElias Habayeb: Yes. So the earnings of the business, as we've said before, if you normalize our long-term expectations, an alternative is trending in the direction we expect it to go, given the growth of the business. We've given you the growth in the reserves, which kind of is a function of the new business we're doing. And the big drivers there is the growth in the PRT business as well as we've become more of a regular issuer of FABNs in it. And so we'd expect that trend to continue.  The one thing is that there will always be volatility, alternatives and that we can't control. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Tom Gallagher with Evercore. \nThomas Gallagher: How much readily deployable excess capital, would you say that you have now? And would you be interested in buying back stock directly from AIG? It's pretty clear they're going to be bringing something relatively soon. Is that something that you're contemplating? \nElias Habayeb: So Tom, it's Elias. So I'm going to answer the second one first, then I'll go back to the first. So as I said, our base case is that we will be buying shares back in the open market. If there is an opportunity to buy back shares from AIG, that's something we'd consider. But right now, our base case are open market purchases. On your first question, it's like, listen, we've given you the path kind of where we are from a parent liquidity perspective as well as where our risk-based capital levels in the insurance companies are.\n Our balance sheet continues to be strong, as you've seen in the past. And we ended the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash. And in April, we got another $550 million out of the U.K. sales. So I think we stand in a strong position from a balance sheet perspective. \nThomas Gallagher: Got you. And Elias, by the way, the $1.7 billion of holdco cash, I think, there was kind of a near-term target of $1.5 billion and then eventually, that was going to drop after the initial separation spend. Are you at that level where you've lowered the target of holdco cash? \nElias Habayeb: So our holdco cash, the target is a function of our debt service cost as a function. We take into consideration next 12 months of regular dividends and any expenses. It is what our next 12-month needs is trending down. We were in a strong position as of the end of the quarter from there, but we would expect it to trend down, but it's a function of the formula I laid out. \nThomas Gallagher: Okay. And just a quick one on investments, just on commercial mortgage loans, a lot -- sorry, what's that? \nIsil Muderrisoglu: Tom, we're limiting it to one question, one follow-up. \nThomas Gallagher: No problem. I'll requeue. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Joel Hurwitz with Dowling & Partners. \nJoel Hurwitz: In group, how much of the withdrawals from the in-plan participants that are retiring? Are you able to capture in your out-of-plan or advisory business? \nKevin Hogan: Yes. Thanks, Joel. We do not report that number. Our valid financial advisers, our 1,100 financial professionals are in a great position to continue to work with the participants throughout their careers so that when it comes time for retirement, they're in the conversation around the aggregation of household assets -- the consolidation of assets at the time of retirement. A lot of times both members of a working family will retire at the same time. \n But what I can say is that if you look at the 1.9 million customers that we have in Group Retirement, about 200,000 of those are in the sort of post retirement period. And while that represents only around 14%, 15% of the total employee population, it does represent around 34%, 35% of the asset base of Group Retirement. So clearly, our strategy of working with people and then aggregating household assets after retirement is an important opportunity for this business. \n So we don't talk about the individual sort of recapture rate, but it's been a successful element of our strategy, and we expect it to continue to be so. \nJoel Hurwitz: Okay. Helpful. And then following up on Elyse's question on PRT. Can you just talk about the competitive environment there and other PRT player [indiscernible] returns on some of this new business are not as attractive as they've historically been? Are you seeing that or maybe it's different in the full plan termination space? \nKevin Hogan: Yes. We focused on the full plan termination space because it is different. And the characteristics of the full plan terminations is a lot of times, you have multiple plans with multiple options, and there are active employees who have deferred those options. So you need to take -- keep track of those to be able to offer them the choices they have at the appropriate time. Plus, it requires a little bit more underwriting sort of focus. \n And so starting almost 10 years ago, we built those administrative capabilities, and we built the underwriting resources, aggregating the data, doing the research necessary. And so we feel in a very good position in full plan terminations. Plus, you have to be able to be quite flexible in working with the plan sponsor in creating the transaction because each one is fairly bespoke. There's no standardized approach, and we're well known, I think, as a problem solver. So what we find is that the number of participants in full plan terminations is lower. \n We have been able to secure very attractive economics on the transactions that we've underwritten and we have the confidence to sort of move away if we don't find that the economics are attractive. We priced the business based on lens looking at economic profitability as well as the GAAP and the stat implications. Sometimes, we consider the GAAP aspect. And the business that we're writing is at returns that are consistent with our sort of medium-term margin expectations. \n So actually, the pipeline is very strong. The transactions are attractive. They take some time to negotiate, but that's one of the reasons that we believe that the economic profile is more attractive, and we will continue to focus on full plan terminations. \nOperator: Our final question today comes from Tom Gallagher with Evercore. \nThomas Gallagher: Thanks for letting me back in. Just the question on the investment side. Elias, I know you've talked about the strength in your reserves for your commercial mortgage loans, which I would concur with. But just curious, would you expect much restructuring and foreclosure activity over the next few years? Meaning, do you expect to use those reserves, or are you not seeing much activity and -- or the [ waters comp ] on that front? \nElias Habayeb: So Tom, if we look at our track record to date, we've been successful in kind of either getting paid off or extending the loans that have come due from that perspective. We have not foreclosed on anyone at this stage. But this is an evolving situation and our team is very proactive in engaging with our borrowers to kind of find the best solutions for people. And as part of trying to agree on an extension, we try to get a restructuring of the capital structure to make sure the property is sustainable. \n That being said, I can't tell you it's not going to happen. But should it happen, we feel comfortable that we're in a good position, not only do we have a strong reserve, but we also -- we have a real estate equity team where we have our own funds. So if we think foreclosure is the right answer for us, we're ready for it between our commercial mortgage loan team and our real estate equity team. We know what to do. But at this point, we have no foreclosures in our portfolio. \nKevin Hogan: Okay. Thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning. Thanks for your questions. Hope everyone has a nice day. \nOperator: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. This concludes our call, and you may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. I will address our consolidated and segment results and provide an update on our capital and liquidity positions. In the quarter, Corebridge delivered strong business results and maintained a robust balance sheet. We continue to create value for shareholders. Corebridge reported first quarter adjusted pretax operating income of $837 million or earnings per share of $1.10 and an increase of 13% year-over-year on a per share basis.  \n Our operating EPS benefited from a $0.06 net impact from notable items in our investment portfolio related to a prior period true-up on certain investments, partially offset by onetime reinsurance-related items in our life insurance business. This was further offset by a $0.17 impact from alternative returns below our long-term expectations. After adjusting for notable items and alternative investments, our run rate operating EPS would have been $1.21. \n This was a 15% increase year-over-year on a comparative basis. Corebridge increased earnings by pursuing profitable growth, optimizing investment portfolio returns, and reducing operating expenses. We grew our core businesses and enhanced our financial flexibility while returning capital to shareholders. And we are on track to deliver on the financial goals we established at the time of the IPO, including delivering an ROE of 12% to 14% and a 60% to 65% payout ratio.  \n Net investment income for our insurance companies on an APTOI basis improved 16% year-over-year, while base portfolio income grew 18% over the same period. Reported base yield increased 50 basis points to 4.92%. Excluding the impact from notable items, base yields increased 35 basis points year-over-year. After adjusting for notable items, we expect base portfolio income and base yield will continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace. \n Variable investment income declined year-over-year, driven by alternative investments, which delivered a $23 million net loss in the quarter. Positive returns in traditional private equity were more than offset by mark-to-market losses in real estate equity.  \n Our real estate equity investment portfolio is largely held in funds that are largely subject to mark-to-market accounting. At this time, we expect that overall variable investment returns in the second quarter will likely remain depressed due to continued negative real estate equity returns resulting from higher cap rates. That said, we see a potential path for overall returns to improve in the second half of the year.  \n General operating expenses for our insurance businesses and parent company were $411 million, better by 10% on a year-over-year basis. This was driven by expense discipline and the benefits of the Corebridge Forward program initiatives earning in. As a reminder, our first quarter expenses reflect seasonality arising from higher compensation and benefits. To date, more than $200 million of savings from the Corebridge Forward program initiatives have earned into results. And we expect the vast majority of these savings to have earned into our run rate earnings by the end of 2024.  \n Corebridge continues to maintain a healthy and strong balance sheet, and our consistent cash flow generation drives shareholder value. We ended the quarter with $1.7 billion of holding company liquidity. Distributions from our insurance companies were $600 million. Corebridge has made significant progress toward achieving a payout ratio of 60% to 65% of adjusted after-tax operating income. We delivered a payout ratio of 56% in the first quarter, returning $386 million of capital, comprised of $243 million of share repurchases, and $143 million of regular quarterly dividends.  \n As of May 2, our year-to-date share repurchases were approximately $370 million. Looking forward, we will remain disciplined with our capital management and expect to deploy proceeds from the sale of our U.K. business with our share repurchases beginning in May 2024, pivoting to the business segments now, which continued their strong performance and disciplined execution during the first quarter. Individual Retirement reported adjusted pretax operating income of $622 million, an 8% increase year-over-year after excluding variable investment income and notable items. \n This improvement was primarily driven by higher base spread income resulting from strong general account growth. Excluding notable items, we grew base spread income by 7% year-over-year, driven by attractive margins and new business and active management of the in-force block. Fee income also grew by 11%, driven by an improvement in underlying asset valuations.  \n I want to spend a little time unpacking how our base net investment spread has trended over time. Since the beginning of 2022, we have grown base spread income by approximately 70% to earn approximately $700 million a quarter. At the same time, we've expanded base net investment spread by approximately 85 basis points, largely driven by higher new money yields on investment-grade assets. These are very attractive historical spread levels.  \n As we mentioned during our February 2024 earnings call, we expect base net investment spread expansion has likely peaked, and there could be some marginal compression. For example, reported base net investment spread for Individual Retirement expanded 13 basis points year-over-year, but compressed 4 basis points after adjusting for notable items. There are 2 primary drivers behind the marginal compression. First, the new business we're writing is attractively priced at double-digit IRRs. However, the base spread on the new business is tighter relative to the base spread on the portfolio.  \n Second, surrenders have been concentrated in blocks with lower crediting rates, putting upward pressure on the portfolio's cost of funds. That said, it's important to put these dynamics in perspective. The important takeaway here is that base net investment spreads on the overall portfolio remain near historic high and are at very attractive levels. Furthermore, we expect base spread income will continue to grow over the coming years.  \n Moving on, this business delivered positive general account net flows of over $600 million in the quarter, even with an elevated fixed annuity surrender rate arising from a large block of exiting its surrender charge period. Our surrender peaked at the beginning of the quarter but trended lower continuing into April. At the same time, we saw monthly sales of fixed annuity steadily increased from January and that trend continued into April. \n Group Retirement reported adjusted pretax operating income of $200 million, an 8% increase year-over-year after excluding variable investment income and notable items. This growth was primarily driven by higher fee income and lower expenses. The increase in fee income, which comprises approximately 50% of group retirement overall sources of income reflects that both the improvement in underlying asset valuations and the growth of our advisory and brokerage business.  \n On the whole, this segment continues to deliver balanced sources of income with a near-even split between spread and fee income. Consistent with industry experience and broader demographic trends, many of our in-plan participants have been entering retirement and are transitioning from asset accumulation to asset distribution. As a result, net outflows are typically driven by in-plan participants aged 59.5 or older, and tend to have higher guaranteed minimum interest rates and higher account balances. \n Concurrently, net inflows are dominated by our in-plan younger age cohorts with lower guaranteed minimum interest rates as well as out-of-plan fixed and fixed index annuity sales and advisory and brokerage deposits.  \n We saw 35% deposit growth in our advisory and brokerage business, which is not included in our reported net flows. Reported base net investment spreads for group retirement expanded 1 basis points year-over-year, but compressed 6 basis points after adjusting for notable items. Life Insurance reported adjusted pretax operating income of $54 million, a 6% decrease year-over-year after excluding variable investment income and notable items. Notable items included approximately $30 million related to a onetime reinsurance related items, partially offset by $8 million of a onetime item in net investment income.  \n The year-over-year comparison of underwriting margin was impacted by the sale of Laya Healthcare, which closed in October 2023. Excluding Laya and variable investment income, underwriting margin declined 9% year-over-year due to notable items and to a lesser extent, universal life seasonal mortality which included higher claims from COVID and other respiratory diseases. \n Our traditional mortality experience, which is primarily comprised of term, was favorable this quarter. Overall mortality experience, inclusive of reserve impact was consistent with our expectations. While our underwriting margin was and will continue to be impacted by the divestiture of the international businesses, the overall impact of the divestitures on our earnings is negligible.  \n Institutional Markets reported adjusted pretax operating income of $112 million, a 37% increase year-over-year after excluding variable investment income and notable items. The improvement was primarily driven by higher spread income arising from the portfolio growth. Our reserves have grown $7 billion or 22% year-over-year, with the expansion of our pension risk transfer business and higher volume of GIC issuances.  \n Looking forward, we continue to expect meaningful opportunities to further expand both businesses at attractive margins, which should lead to ongoing growth of base spread income and distributable cash flows.  \n In conclusion, the continuing improvement in our financial results reflects our achievements, growing the business while exercising discipline with our expenses. Corebridge continues to generate strong results growing our franchise value, and highlighting the increasing value proposition we provide to investors. I will now turn the call back to Isil. Happy to, and it's Elias. So what I'd say is both items are somewhat related. They identified as part of our work to convert into a new system. And they relate to true-up on historical net investment income where we under reported historically over several years. And they are onetime of nature and that's why we're calling them out from there. Yes. Elyse, it's Elias. So as Kevin said, our base case will be to use the proceeds for open market repurchases. Our philosophy around that is we want to be consistent in the market, and we're mindful of where the trading volumes are. So that's going to inform how much we will do at any point in time. Ryan, it's Elias. So from here, there could be some more marginal compression. It's not going to be a lot in individual retirement. But the key thing for us is we're going to be growing earnings in that business. It's part sales, but it's partly higher reinvestments on the business. So you go back to Kevin's earlier comments, we expect growth in spread products given the current outlook. \n We're reinvesting money at much higher levels than where assets are rolling out of the portfolio. But there's a bit of a headwind on the cost of funds for the reasons Kevin articulated, but earnings is going to grow big spreads. Will be flattish to maybe marginally down. \n And on group, kind of similar, dynamics are a little different, but similar, flat to maybe slightly down from here. You're normalizing, Ryan, to the run rate kind of on alternatives in that estimate, correct? Yes. So the earnings of the business, as we've said before, if you normalize our long-term expectations, an alternative is trending in the direction we expect it to go, given the growth of the business. We've given you the growth in the reserves, which kind of is a function of the new business we're doing. And the big drivers there is the growth in the PRT business as well as we've become more of a regular issuer of FABNs in it. And so we'd expect that trend to continue.  The one thing is that there will always be volatility, alternatives and that we can't control. So Tom, it's Elias. So I'm going to answer the second one first, then I'll go back to the first. So as I said, our base case is that we will be buying shares back in the open market. If there is an opportunity to buy back shares from AIG, that's something we'd consider. But right now, our base case are open market purchases. On your first question, it's like, listen, we've given you the path kind of where we are from a parent liquidity perspective as well as where our risk-based capital levels in the insurance companies are.\n Our balance sheet continues to be strong, as you've seen in the past. And we ended the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash. And in April, we got another $550 million out of the U.K. sales. So I think we stand in a strong position from a balance sheet perspective. So our holdco cash, the target is a function of our debt service cost as a function. We take into consideration next 12 months of regular dividends and any expenses. It is what our next 12-month needs is trending down. We were in a strong position as of the end of the quarter from there, but we would expect it to trend down, but it's a function of the formula I laid out. So Tom, if we look at our track record to date, we've been successful in kind of either getting paid off or extending the loans that have come due from that perspective. We have not foreclosed on anyone at this stage. But this is an evolving situation and our team is very proactive in engaging with our borrowers to kind of find the best solutions for people. And as part of trying to agree on an extension, we try to get a restructuring of the capital structure to make sure the property is sustainable. \n That being said, I can't tell you it's not going to happen. But should it happen, we feel comfortable that we're in a good position, not only do we have a strong reserve, but we also -- we have a real estate equity team where we have our own funds. So if we think foreclosure is the right answer for us, we're ready for it between our commercial mortgage loan team and our real estate equity team. We know what to do. But at this point, we have no foreclosures in our portfolio."

            "name": "Kevin Hogan",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Our team continues to execute with focus, and we are delivering on our commitments to customers and shareholders. During today's call, I will discuss what has been a strong start to the year for Corebridge. In addition to reviewing high-level results for our first quarter I will share trends we are seeing across our company and how well we are positioned for the future. Elias will then follow with more detail on our performance.  \n This morning, we reported adjusted after-tax operating income of $688 million or operating earnings per share of $1.10, a 13% increase year-over-year. We also reported adjusted return on average equity of 11.9%, a 110 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter. Our run rate return on equity, which is adjusted for alternative investment returns that are below our long-term expectations and notable items, was 13.1%. That is solidly within our target range of 12% to 14%. This first quarter run rate represents a 140 basis point improvement year-over-year and 250 basis point increase since our IPO.  \n Looking at the quarter, we see 4 key factors contributing to the growth of our franchise value, our diversified business model, continuing strong sales, attractive margins, and significant expense savings. I will address each in turn and then comment on our business. The first factor is our diversified business model, which includes our broad product and distribution platform and generates multiple sources of income that enables strong cash flows. The wide range of products and channels across our 4 businesses is a competitive advantage for Corebridge, positioning us to perform across different market conditions and prudently generate new business.  \n In any given market, we can capitalize on prevailing dynamics to focus on growth opportunities where the risk-adjusted returns are the most attractive, optimizing our mix of spread fee and underwriting margin. For base spread income, which grew 14% year-over-year, we leverage our portfolio of general account products to meet the evolving needs of our customers and partners. At the same time, we are seeing favorable dynamics for fee income, which increased 9% year-over-year. With equity markets moving higher, fee income is on the rise, rebounding from prior year lows.  \n Our assets under management and administration have grown to $393 billion, a 7% improvement year-over-year. This large asset base will be an earnings driver for our spread-based and fee-based businesses. Underwriting margin this quarter was impacted by onetime reinsurance-related items as well as seasonal mortality. Our overall mortality remains within expectations. \n Our diversified sources of income create financial flexibility, which enables our insurance operations to generate consistent and strong cash flows of over $2 billion annually. These cash flows position the company to deliver on our commitments to shareholders and provide an attractive capital return across market cycles.  \n The second factor is our robust sales volume. Corebridge delivered $10.6 billion of premiums and deposits in the first quarter and $50 billion over the last 5 quarters. We expect demand for our products and services to remain strong, as we are well positioned in the large and growing markets where we compete. \n Further, these markets are favorably supported by prevailing demographics and macroeconomic trends. The third factor is that we continue to produce attractive margins. We actively manage our business portfolios to ensure we maintain strong profitability levels with double-digit IRRs.  \n And the fourth factor, in addition to growing our aggregate core sources of income and actively managing our capital, we have also been reducing our expenses. We successfully completed our modernization program, Corebridge Forward, having acted on or contracted for the full $400 million of run rate savings. While we are pleased to have completed this initiative, we are building off our momentum to adopt the philosophy of continuous improvement, as we are committed to increasing our efficiency over time.  \n Turning to our segments, an Individual Retirement, we continue to deliver strong sales. We remain well positioned to meet the needs of an aging U.S. population and to partner with a new generation of advisers who are recognizing the value of annuities as part of a long-term investment plan. Our sales volume for fixed and fixed index annuities was $4.5 billion for the quarter, remaining near historic highs. General account net inflows were over $600 million for the first quarter despite a higher volume of fixed annuities exiting their surrender charge protection.  \n Turning to Group Retirement. It delivered premiums and deposits of $2 billion this quarter. There are 3 parts to this business: In-plan, out-of-plan and advisory and brokerage, all distributed by our own field force of financial professionals. The in-plan business represents defined contribution plan serving tax exempt and public sector organization. Whereas in the out-of-plan business, we extend our relationship to provide services beyond employer-sponsored retirement plans. Our advisory and brokerage platform supports both businesses where we provide customers access to a range of third-party products or services.  \n Group Retirement is a consistent contributor to our results with a balanced mix of spread and fee income driven by a $126 billion asset base, which grew 7% year-over-year. This business is well positioned to serve the need for financial planning advice, as we focus on plan sponsors that value the role of our advisers. We differentiate ourselves with our field force of experienced financial professionals and proprietary tools that support financial planning capabilities for both in-plan and out-of-plan customers. In life insurance, we continue to generate attractive growth in our U.S. business.  \n Recently, we have been outpacing the market. And in the first quarter, we increased U.S. sales 9% over the prior year. Our distribution partners and customers continue to see value in our select range of products, including simple protection products designed for the middle market and Corebridge remains well positioned to meet demand. With our digital end-to-end platform and our automated underwriting tools, we make it quicker and easier for our customers to purchase life insurance. \n In early April, we announced that we closed the sale of our U.K. life insurance business to Aviva. With this transaction now closed, we are fully focused on life and retirement products and solutions in the world's largest life insurance market, the U.S. This sale was highly accretive. And together with last year's sale of Laya Healthcare in Ireland, we have unlocked approximately $1.3 billion of value for shareholders with a negligible impact on future earnings.  \n In institutional markets, we closed $1.8 billion of pension risk transfers during the quarter at attractive margins. Corebridge is well positioned to support the growing demand for pension risk transfers including full plan terminations, which we have focused on for years, investing to develop what we believe is a competitive advantage, serving employers looking to holistically exit their pension obligations. We expect to continue to see a robust pipeline in 2024, as more plans are fully funded and many companies are highly motivated to act. We also issued $600 million of GICs in the first quarter having become a more regular FABN issuer, and we expect to incrementally grow this book, building on our 2023 volumes.  \n The new business volume we have generated across the company is robust, and we are investing in attractive assets to support these levels. Our asset origination platform put over $9 billion to work in the first quarter, investing at an average of single A+, incrementally improving the credit quality of our portfolio. New money yields remained strong in the first quarter, approximately 160 basis points above the average yield on assets rolling out of the portfolio. \n Our investment portfolio remains well diversified and high quality, with over 95% of our fixed income assets rated investment grade, and we remain committed to achieving strong risk-adjusted returns while matching the duration and liquidity needs of our liabilities.  \n Turning to our financial position, our balance sheet remains strong. We maintain a comprehensive risk management framework and are selective and the liabilities we originate, putting us in a position where we can continue to invest in our business while also returning attractive levels of capital to shareholders. We are also continuing our work to expand the capabilities of our Bermuda entity to support further business development activities. The regulatory process remains on track, and when we receive the required approvals, we anticipate leveraging this structure in 2024.  \n When complete, these capabilities will give us the opportunity to expand our financial flexibility and provide additional capacity to support growth and optimize our capital. This week, our Board of Directors approved an increase of $2 billion to our existing share repurchase authorization. This increase reflects the board's ongoing confidence in our financial strength. And with this enhanced capacity, we expect to have the financial flexibility to continue our capital management objectives into 2025. Looking ahead, Corebridge remains committed to growing our business, serving our customers and creating long-term value for our shareholders.  \n We are executing all of the strategies necessary to deliver on our commitment to achieve a 12% to 14% ROE, 60% to 65% payout ratio and maintain our strong financial position. Thanks to the energy and hard work of our team and with gratitude for the support of our partners and AIG, we remain well positioned to help more people in this country take action in their financial lives. I will now turn the call over to Elias, who will go into more detail on Corebridge's results for the quarter. Yes. Thanks, Suneet. Appreciate the question. The reality is, if you look back over -- up until maybe 2 years ago when the interest rate cycle started to change, an investment portfolio and the role that a fixed income return type vehicles, such as a fixed or fixed index annuity can provide for kind of a low-risk way was not something that was seriously considered because of the very low returns that were available.  \n And what's been happening in the last couple of years with the change in interest rates is that there is now perceived to be great value in fixed income asset allocation as part of a long-term investment strategy. And an annuity is a very attractive option as part of that asset allocation. And so for financial advisers that have been in the business, let's say, 10 years or 12 years, this is the first time they've actually had a chance to see interest rates at a point where the returns available in the fixed allocation product are attractive.  \n And so that's a new generation of advisers that are understanding that asset allocation strategy and embracing it, and also customers enjoying the same thing. So we do see it as a secular trend. It raises the boats for the industry. That's something that is driving new business volumes. Our largest, fastest-growing distribution channels are still professional distribution in broker-dealers, financial advisers and banks. And so it is within those adviser communities that we're seeing this trend, and we expect that it will continue. Yes, thanks. I'll jump in, Suneet. We have seen some modest spread compression, and we may incrementally see a little bit more of that in the near term. I think it's important to understand why. So from the beginning -- and this was in the last prepared remarks, right? We executed well at the beginning of the change in the interest rate cycle with our strong distribution presence and our broad product platform. And as Elias pointed out, we very rapidly grew both our base spreads and our spread income.  \n And the reality is that the in-force margins right now have benefited from the reinvestment opportunity with almost no impact on the underlying cost of funds. And at the same time, the new business margins are also very attractive, and the new business sales are robust. So the effect that you're seeing is that the new business, the cost of funds are higher because of where interest rates are now and that's incrementally increasing the cost of funds in the overall portfolio. But the reality is that the in-force is profitable. The new business is profitable, and we do expect the spread income to grow because the general account is growing and the overall earnings base is growing.  \n And the conditions remain good. We continue to be in a strong distribution position. The macro environment is very supportive. The market need is there. And so we remain very optimistic about the business, although base spreads themselves may have peaked, and that's more of a reflection of the fact that we executed well and executed early. And we feel confident we're on a clear path to achieve our 12% to 14% ROE in all of our other targets. Yes. Thanks, John. So we track it a little more carefully in group retirement and in-plan business. And what I can say is that our in-plan business in Group Retirement exceeded an average age of 59.5 about 10 years ago. I don't have the exact date in front of me. And in fact, if you look at the entire defined contribution industry, that kind of tracks with the aging of the in-plan business across the industry, not just in the 403(b) and the not-for-profits that we participate in, but even in the 401(k) kind of part of the market. And since then, we've seen an incremental increase in the average age. I think now it's in the low 60s for the in-plan business.  \n The out-of-plan business is a slightly different age profile. And then in the Individual Retirement business, it really depends on the product. The fixed annuity customers tend to be a little bit older. The variable annuity customers kind of in the middle and then the index annuity customers maybe a little bit younger. So between 50 and 70 is, I think, where we'd see the average ages across the Individual Retirement portfolio, but we can get back with some more specific numbers. Yes. So the final guidance has now been released. It is effective in September of 2024. And then there's like 12 months for the advisers to be able to implement the new prohibited transaction exemptions. I guess what I'd say is, look, we're in a highly regulated business. We are -- we understand our obligations. We'll be prepared to implement what is necessary. The industry has essentially implemented something like this before, and we did as well, and we're prepared to do so again.  \n What I would say is that for individual retirement, our business really grew up in the registered world. And as I mentioned earlier, most of our largest distribution channels are professional distribution like representatives of broker-dealers or banks. And so 90% of our Individual Retirement distribution and 100% of our Group Retirement distribution through VFA, they are familiar already with the fundamentals of the SEC's Reg BI or NAIC's version of that best interest parameter and so are largely already adhering to many of those principles.  \n In the Individual Retirement business, we have a small participation in the IMO channel. But it is an important channel because it reaches a different demographic, and it's something that strategically we're trying to develop. So we're still studying the final rule. We'll be prepared to implement it.  We think it's important to have a common standard of care that everyone understands and that there will be accessed for financial education. But most of our distribution are familiar with the requirements of our best interest type standard. Yes, sure. Thanks, Wes. Nice to hear from you. So as I've said, we regularly review opportunities to increase the value and optimize our portfolio. We're very familiar with the process. We demonstrated our ability to execute when we created Fortitude Re. We did prioritize the sale of our international operations, and we feel great about the $1.3 billion in value we created there.  \n As we mentioned recently, we are working to expand the capability of our Bermuda entity, and we're making good progress there. And that's something that is an opportunity that we can leverage relative to both our new business in terms of supporting growth or capital efficiency. But we're also evaluating external transaction potential, and we understand the opportunities there. So we're evaluating all the options, any transaction that we do will be attractive to the company and to our shareholders. And we will provide an update at the time that we have any news. Yes. So look, Elyse, I'll start with just some general comments about our capital management philosophy and then I'll hand it over to Elias with respect to the options in front of us. But we have a very clear capital management strategy, and we are committed to executing it with discipline that starts with, frankly, building a company that has a strong balance sheet, consistent cash flows and a nimble business model. And we are committed to delivering that 60% to 65% payout ratio on an ongoing basis without necessarily the need for specific transactions.  \n But when we do have transactions that generate excess capital, we look at the options in front of us in terms of the best way to distribute that, largely focusing now on kind of open market repurchases. We have stated that the U.K. Life proceeds will be targeted for repurchases. And there are a number of options in front of us. And I'll ask Elias to comment on that. Yes. Thanks, Elyse. The marketplace for pension risk transfer is very well positioned right now with where interest rates -- with interest rates are, a lot of plans are fully funded and companies that have been thinking about this for some time are prepared to ask and -- so companies are prepared to ask. And then for those companies that may be surprised a little bit by the fact that they are fully funded are also moving very, very quickly to not miss the opportunity. \n We focus on full plan terminations. We focused on that market for some time, which are a little bit more complex. We focus on medium to larger-sized transactions. \n And we've built the capabilities necessary to support all the optionality in full plan terminations. And the reality is, is that the pipeline, both in the U.S. and the U.K., where we act as a reinsurer for full plan terminations is as strong as we've seen it. Think the market volumes this year are expected to be at or above where they were last year. \n But what I'll say is that it's hard to project the run rate because these transactions are highly complex and episodic. We underwrite that each one of them is if they were an M&A transaction. You're buying a sort of mini balance sheet. You have to understand both the liability and the asset side. \n So we have a very large pipeline of medium to large transactions. And ultimately, we'll be most focused on the economics of any given transaction and ensuring that we're delivering accretive outcomes for our portfolio. Yes. Sorry -- Ryan, sorry. I just wanted to add on. Like we are talking incremental marginal spread compression, not significant spread compression as the cost of funds increase. So -- and that's the reason that what we're really focused on, is the fact that the spread income is in the base that generates the spread income. We expect to continue to grow, in particular, in individual retirement. Yes. Thanks, Joel. We do not report that number. Our valid financial advisers, our 1,100 financial professionals are in a great position to continue to work with the participants throughout their careers so that when it comes time for retirement, they're in the conversation around the aggregation of household assets -- the consolidation of assets at the time of retirement. A lot of times both members of a working family will retire at the same time. \n But what I can say is that if you look at the 1.9 million customers that we have in Group Retirement, about 200,000 of those are in the sort of post retirement period. And while that represents only around 14%, 15% of the total employee population, it does represent around 34%, 35% of the asset base of Group Retirement. So clearly, our strategy of working with people and then aggregating household assets after retirement is an important opportunity for this business. \n So we don't talk about the individual sort of recapture rate, but it's been a successful element of our strategy, and we expect it to continue to be so. Yes. We focused on the full plan termination space because it is different. And the characteristics of the full plan terminations is a lot of times, you have multiple plans with multiple options, and there are active employees who have deferred those options. So you need to take -- keep track of those to be able to offer them the choices they have at the appropriate time. Plus, it requires a little bit more underwriting sort of focus. \n And so starting almost 10 years ago, we built those administrative capabilities, and we built the underwriting resources, aggregating the data, doing the research necessary. And so we feel in a very good position in full plan terminations. Plus, you have to be able to be quite flexible in working with the plan sponsor in creating the transaction because each one is fairly bespoke. There's no standardized approach, and we're well known, I think, as a problem solver. So what we find is that the number of participants in full plan terminations is lower. \n We have been able to secure very attractive economics on the transactions that we've underwritten and we have the confidence to sort of move away if we don't find that the economics are attractive. We priced the business based on lens looking at economic profitability as well as the GAAP and the stat implications. Sometimes, we consider the GAAP aspect. And the business that we're writing is at returns that are consistent with our sort of medium-term margin expectations. \n So actually, the pipeline is very strong. The transactions are attractive. They take some time to negotiate, but that's one of the reasons that we believe that the economic profile is more attractive, and we will continue to focus on full plan terminations. Okay. Thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning. Thanks for your questions. Hope everyone has a nice day."
