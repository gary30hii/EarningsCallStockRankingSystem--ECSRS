        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International Fourth Quarter 2020 Year-End Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about an hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. . I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.\nNicholas Rolli: Welcome, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2020 fourth quarter and full year results. You may access the release on www.pmi.com. \nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I hope everyone listening to the call is safe and well. Our business delivered a robust performance in 2020, despite the unprecedented challenges of the global pandemic. Most impressive was the continued strong growth of IQOS, which made up over 10% of our volumes and almost 1/4 of our net revenues for the year.  The daily consumption of HTUs by IQOS user saw minimal impact from social restriction, and despite significant constraint, we were able to continue acquiring new user in switching from cigarettes at a very good pace to reach a total of 17.6 million, of which 12.7 million have switched to IQOS and stopped smoking.  HTU shipment volumes grew 28% compared to the prior year, with record market shares in key IQOS geographies in Q4. Moreover, 10 markets exited 2020 with double-digit national share in December. Our rate of user acquisition was again strong in Q4, propelled by the increasing sophistication of our digital commercial model and the positive word-of-mouth effect from this increasing prominence, despite tighter restriction in a number of markets. \nOperator: Thank you. We will now conduct a question-and-answer portion of the conference. . Our first question will come from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: Hi, everyone.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Hi, Bonnie.\nBonnie Herzog: Hi, and congratulations, Andre and Jacek. I guess my first question today would be on margins. And I guess, Emmanuel, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about your expectations around margins, I guess, in terms of any favorable fixed cost absorption you expect as you amortize the investment behind IQOS over this increasingly larger accelerating volume base.  And then as I'm thinking about that, in the context of your variable costs going lower as you touched upon thinking about the progress you've made with digital, so could you just talk about that and how big of an impact this could be or big of an opportunity this could be in the future? Thanks.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Sure, Bonnie. Happy to do that. It's going to be only a teaser versus what we're going to see next week. So bear with us, and we'll elaborate with much more detail. But I can certainly anticipate a few headlines on what we'll share next week.  I think what is obvious in our number for 2020 is the fact that, beyond the great performance of IQOS, we have also used efficiency on cost as a powerful lever to generate performance. That's really showing up very clearly in our numbers. So we are delivering in two years, instead of three years, the overall at least $1 billion savings. And what is good is that we are working on cost efficiency on several levels, and many of them, of course, are related to IQOS, but not exclusively to IQOS for some of them.  If you look at the gross margin level, it's quite obvious that we are being very successful in generating manufacturing productivity, and that's a great driver for further margin improvement. And here, we are working globally across the portfolio, I would say, on margin improvement. So it's not just on IQOS, even if probably on IQOS, because that's a business that doesn't have the same maturity, we have more runway, if you want to improve the productivity. And we are certainly making extremely good inroad in that respect, but we are also generating manufacturing productivity on CC.  And then on our SG&A, I think you could identify two drivers on cost efficiency. One, I would say, it's probably something you're going to find in many companies today. We are working to be a more efficient and agile company. So we work on being more digitized, we work on simplifying the way we work, we automate, we standardize, and that is allowing us not to be cost cutter, but just to take cost to be a better company and deliver overall higher performance. And then you have elements that are indeed connected with our commercial performance and not only to IQOS, but certainly mainly to IQOS, and you have two elements. One is all the investment that we made in the past, and that is a great platform on IQOS. And I'm not saying that the investment is over. We're going to keep investing. But, of course, we have now an investment that we amortize over a fast-growing base. And we are not growing the level of investment at the speed of the growth of the IQOS business.  And then there is this great work that we are doing. Thanks to digital and thanks, of course, to all the learnings that we are making on the IQOS business, where we very nicely reduced all the variable per user cost. But I will stop there because we will elaborate on that next week.\nBonnie Herzog: Okay. That was really helpful. I appreciate that. And then my second question is all the progress you've made with IQOS in growing the base, and it's so large. But as you look out, could you talk about further segmentation of markets with your different platforms or possibly different price points as you continue to convert more smokers? I mean you touched on that. My guess is you're going to touch on that more next week.  But just as I look at your business, it implies that your user base is probably going to need to double in the next maybe three-plus years based on our analysis for you to hit your aspirational target of that 250 billion units by 2025. So love to hear any strategy there, insights because if I think about it, I assume more of the conversion is going to come from other reduced-risk technologies. And how do you anticipate your mix evolving over time? Thanks.\nAndre Calantzopoulos: Yes. I'll give you the first shot. I still believe, over the next three years, Bonnie, as I said many times, that heated tobacco technology will be the prevailing technology because it has the highest ability in terms of taste and satisfaction to convert people.  Now in terms of segmentation, I believe, in most markets, we will need one or two heat-not-burn technologies, if I stay with this segment, and probably two to three, over time, consumable price segment, so we can cover mostly the vast majority of the market. There will be exclusions where you need to cover four price segments with probably two technologies. And we'll talk next week about the next step in technology for aerosolization in heat-not-burn, which will address many of the pain points consumers have today.  Now clearly, the heated tobacco product is one category. I think that's the fastest growth, both in terms of revenue and bottom line and volume. The second is obviously e-vapor. We are entering this market because I believe there is consumers there that want to switch trade to these products. There is a lot of dual users, and we see also dual users between heat-not burn and e-vapor that, obviously, we would like to capture. I think we can also capture consumers for every e-vapor products.  The key there is clearly to leverage the infrastructure and the brand name of IQOS. I think the product is very good, and that's the first reactions we get, but we need to build equity because that's a problem for the category, as you know, and also consumer loyalty because for the economics to be at best for e-vapor, you don't only need to be premium positioned, but you also need to have loyal consumers because if you discount just products and you sell them, and then a consumer has 10 different products from 10 different competitors and consumes half a cartridge of your product per week, it's very difficult to make the turn and, more importantly, it's very difficult to maintain an infrastructure. Now we have the advantage of having a lot of infrastructure with IQOS that we can leverage. The equity of IQOS is undeniably the best in the RRP, so I think that's helpful. Technology is good. We are premium, so I think we can make inroads in this category.  And then obviously, we were also going to expand in the pure nicotine products like nicotine pouches or the P3 over time, although I think this is more occasional use products or non-predominant use products. So that's a little bit -- and again, sorry to cut this here, but we're going to elaborate this more -- in more -- extensively next week, okay?\nBonnie Herzog: I expected that. So very helpful. Thank you so much.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Bonnie.\nOperator: The next question will come from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler.\nMichael Lavery: Just wanted to touch on IQOS again. And the Philippines, you have a 20 basis points share, which, of course, is small, but it's very early there. And if I understand it right, you launched there without any stores initially. You also touched on the call about some digital launches in Estonia and Kuwait and the Maldives.  And so just would love a little more sense of how some of those digital efforts work. And it's certainly seen in the Philippines, they're ready to be pretty quickly effective. Can you just bring to life a little bit of how you're going to market there?\nJacek Olczak: Yes. It's Jacek here. So yes, we started this year in Philippines, to be very precise, in the Manila, not even greater Manila. And the product as expected actually responded pretty well. This was one of the first fully digital, if I may, launch, also driven by the fact that we had to change the strategy last moment due to the COVID restrictions and the whole COVID impact.  And the product starts getting good tractions. I think we'll still stay for a while in Manila, which is, frankly speaking, not the major secret because we're following the same path of the same strategy for the rollout in every geographies, right, especially if you go to the sizable geography like Philippines.  But product is well received. I think the taste characteristics, et cetera, fits very well. We're also testing the different route-to-consumer models, as we're entering the countries when you have a stick purchase. There is a lot of consumption on trade rather than just off trade. So we need to come up with very good solutions there. But I'm very positive on that part of Asia, which is still unchartered for IQOS.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. That's helpful. And just a second one on buybacks. Helpful clarity that there's no consideration on that in the guidance. But with some currency tailwinds now and the balance sheet where it is, it certainly seems like that could be -- it could come into play. Can you give a sense of what you would need to have in place or see before you might trigger resuming with buybacks?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Look, if you bear with us until next week, we'll have a global review of our capital allocation strategy, and we'll address all components at that stage.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. That's no problem. If I could just maybe swap that question then. Could you give any sense of where you stand on Platform 2 with TEEPS? Any update on that?\nJacek Olczak: On TEEPS on the Platform 2, I mean, we will be further conducting that this time the market commercial test this year in 2021.\nOperator: The next question will come from the line of Vivien Azer with Cowen.\nVivien Azer: I wanted to also drill down on IQOS. I was wondering if you could give us some color on what the mix looks like for the consumables from traditional tobacco flavors and some of the novel flavors that you have in the market.\nJacek Olczak: That's Jacek here, Vivien. It varies market by market, okay? Obviously, as you know, we have flavors of menthol. We have some other flavors. But still, IQOS, frankly speaking, in most of the places is very much attractiveness is coming from tobacco flavors.  I mean, at the end of the day, most of the segments which we are targeting at this stage, and we are operating at scale, I mean most of the segments are the flavor -- tobacco flavor type of segment, right? So IQOS really has a very winning proposition. There also has a great proposition in menthol and our flavors.  So that varies by the country, and you can't really -- I think if I give you the international share of the flavors, it will be just misleading. The average doesn't make that. But it follows, typically, if you have a predominant menthol market like Japan, the dominance of menthol if you are predominantly full -- I mean, cigarette markets without menthol, then you are predominantly there. A bit sometimes over indexed in menthol in general because it has a bit more impact for people, so it's easier to switch.\nVivien Azer: Understood. And my follow-up also on IQOS, please. In terms of the market share progression that you saw in Japan, either in the quarter over the course of the year, can you contextualize the contribution from the Marlboro brand versus the HEETS brand?\nJacek Olczak: The Marlboro brand is still the major contributor of the overall volumes and the growth, so we're very pleased that on the course of the last year, we continue growing Marlboro.  Obviously, HEETS, which is priced not below the Marlboro had a bit a better dynamics than Marlboro, but the above actually contributing to the growth. And it's very interesting, Vivien. You're asking because this is the first market which we try the dual -- or double -- dual positioning of the consumables, Marlboro and HEETS in Japan.  As you know very well, we also extended HEETS in a couple of Eastern European geographies, in Russia. When first, we brought the above premium propositions to HEETS, the HEETS Creations. And the HEETS Creations contributes. So we like premium rise further to HEETS in Russia. And HEETS Creations in Moscow constitute now about 10% of the overall HEETS volume. So that's very good.  And then we complemented on the notch below price segment by bringing the lil Fiit proposition. So with now in Russia, we're testing can IQOS operate on the free essentially price segments on the devices. And the spread is pretty phenomenal because IQOS devices will go from $60 on the premium device, and then we go down to the $20 on the lil device. And then we have a coverage on the consumables spreading from RUB 170 per pack to RUB 130.  So it gives you the hint how broadly we now -- why we can go with IQOS touching the segments above medium and below medium. And this is despite, as you know, that we have a competition in Russia. But frankly speaking, competition in terms of the devices is essentially close to 0.  So it's a little bit of a very aggressive promotions, but we continue delivering the strong growth on IQOS, both in terms of user acquisitions measured by the device sales and by the HEETS -- further expansions on the HEETS. And what is also good in places like in Russia that we continue growing in the top cities, which we started a few years ago. So we have a continuous growth in the cities, and the expansion doesn't need from that growth which we have in the Moscow, St. Petersburg and the other main cities.\nOperator: The next question will come from the line of Gaurav Jain with Barclays.\nGaurav Jain: So on the organic margin improvement, which you are guiding to for FY '21 of 150 basis points, that is on top of 240 basis point improvement in FY '20. And this saw benefits like production and travel expense, there was a cut in German VAT, et cetera.  So what I'm trying to ask is that is your underlying margin improvement closer to 200 basis points, not 150 basis points, and that is clearly happening because of high cost. So is that how we should be thinking about the next few years as well?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Well, so for the medium term, again, we'll elaborate next week on more outlook. For the year, Gaurav, I'll let you make your assumption. I think we are clear on the kind of one-off savings that we have seen because of the COVID, so you can factor that in your model. And then I think we are also clear on what are the driver for margin improvement. So it's about the positive impact of the growth of IQOS in terms of per stick revenue, in terms of margin and then everything that is happening on cost efficiency.  That is really what is driving -- that has been driving the margin improvement in 2020, and that will continue in 2021. As you can imagine, beyond 2021, but we'll elaborate on that next week.\nGaurav Jain: Sure. My second question is on the European Beating Cancer Plan, which was released earlier this week, and they talk of things like flavor ban, plain packaging, increasing taxes on heated tobacco to -- equal to cigarettes. So how do you think of that? And how do you incorporate these sort of risks in your outlook?\nAndre Calantzopoulos: Okay. First of all, this is a plan, and there are many positive aspects also in this plan in my view. First of all, we don't talk about taxes. I mean, this is subject to directives. The tobacco excise directive that governs the excise tax and the tobacco product directive, that is the regulation of the products, okay?  The first is the tobacco side directive today does not foresee reduced risk product category, so it has to be amended under all circumstances, okay? And we're not talking about increases. It's creating a framework under which member states can tax.  Our view is that absence of combustion, for example, is a key criteria on how to tax differently cigarettes to other products. And then within that major cliff of change in toxicity and exposure, member states can have different tax rates for these products. But this product should not be, by any means, higher than any combustible category available, okay, as a minimum criteria. But this has to happen.  Nobody said that taxes will increase or hit the tobacco products, frankly speaking, at this stage or in vapor product, okay? So all this has to be defined, and the discussions are going to start in the course of this year and continue in next year, in any case.  So that's for -- and then the tobacco product directive been served, I hope that there will be a bit more regulatory clarity in there regarding RRPs because -- and e-vapor product because just now, we left it up to the member state to regulate, which, frankly speaking, is not harmonizing a directive, one; and secondly is a pain for all the industry participants because every country has a different regulation. And we always advocated serious regulation on these products, provided that this is differentiated from cigarettes, okay?  Now there are voices that say that these products should be the same thing as cigarettes. But at the end of the day, it was very clear also in the cancer plan that all -- in the Q&A that only based on science and evidence, they will take decisions. So I wouldn't be particularly worried about this at this stage. And I think the outcome may be positive actually because it's an opportunity to discuss all these things. Now in the longer term, we discussed very often, I believe tax differentials will be maintained because it makes sense for public health, it makes sense for the consumers. And as we also explained, we have room even to pass taxes if, by any chance, differentials close somehow because IQOS, also in order to pass part of the tax benefit to the consumers, it's mid-price position, essentially, if you take the weighted average of the countries, number one.  And number two, its price productivity is much, much higher than cigarettes, so passing on a tax is triggering less price increase than passing on tax on cigarettes. So that's in a nutshell the way we should look at it, but we have to assume that excise taxes will increase over time also for RRPs as governments need money, and that will apply to heated tobacco products that's already taxed substantially and, potentially, in some cases, to e-vapor products in the future. But that's all baked in, in the assumptions.\nGaurav Jain: Sure. And if I can ask one last question. It's on a minority interest, which has been increasing at a higher rate than your EBIT, and that's driven by Philippines. So is there an opportunity to reduce your minority interest, considering your partner in Philippines, it trades on the exchanges at like some 6x PE?\nAndre Calantzopoulos: No, we don't envisage this. Not in the -- I mean if our partner wants to sell one day, we can discuss. At the moment, they're very happy with us.\nEmmanuel Babeau: We're very happy with our partnership in Philippines.\nOperator: The next question will come from the line of Adam Spielman with Citi.\nAdam Spielman: So the first question, I think you said in your guidance that you're expecting to take less pricing variance on combustible cigarettes than usual. Now for years and years and years, it's been 6%, and I think you said it's something to do with COVID that you want to take less pricing. I'm really surprised by that.  You also said the pricing model has been broken. So I suppose the question is, if you take less pricing in combustibles this year, 2021, what would it take for you to have another low year in 2022? That will be my first question.\nAndre Calantzopoulos: Okay. First of all, we didn't say we will take less pricing. We will also -- where the pricing opportunity, we'll take pricing, and I think the model still works very well. Elasticities are the same, everything.  We had to make some, in my view, reasonable, conservative, you may say, assumptions regarding what's going to happen in Indonesia and Russia because of the tax increase. And Indonesia has never got it carryover from last year, which makes the comparisons year-to-year problematic, okay? Plus, in Germany, we had a VAT, I would say, tax break, which we assume is not going to continue this year. So if you exclude all these elements, I think we're still back to a normal pricing in the other markets.  So clearly, in terms of post-COVID, I would say, assumptions, we have to watch more carefully the price gaps, that's clear, at the mid- to low end of the market, but that doesn't mean that we're going to take any severe pricing decisions at this stage anywhere. I just -- this is a watch out.  If there is down trading, which is happening between the mid-price typically and the low-price segment, also because we have absence of contraband and all these things, that's something to watch in certain markets. But overall, I think we're in good shape.  Also both on IQOS, on heat-not-burn products and combustible, the excise taxes are now in, if I'm not mistaken, everywhere. So we have pretty good visibility of where we are, okay? So I don't think it's super COVID related. What is COVID related in the guidance is the range we gave because if you look, Adam, at what happened last year, if we assume 2% to 3% underlying industry decline, even baking in Indonesia, we had a 6.7% industry decline.  So we're missing consumption for mathematically 3.7%to 4.7%. That's on average, $100 billion for the industry. So we don't -- that will rebound, in my view, one day, but once the restrictions finish.  Now we gave a guidance for this year of 0 to minus 3, which is at 0, you have some recovery. At minus 3, you have super underlying negativity, maybe exaggerated. I don't know at this stage, but that's plus/minus 20 billion units for us. So that's plus/minus 2.5 revenue points.  So that's where the volatility is, okay? And if pricing comes better in Russia and Indonesia, that much the better. We may end up at the high end of the range.\nAdam Spielman: Okay. Well, I think that leads to my next question, which is, to be blunt, I don't really understand the EPS guidance, and there are many aspects to really understand about it.  So first of all, you're saying in Q1, where your comp is insanely hard, you're going to have flat organic sales, you're going to have margin expansion, you're going to have 8% like-for-like EPS growth. You then say because the comp is really easy in Q2, you're going to have a great quarter, or you imply that. And yet the full year is only 9% to 11%, and it seems to me that if you can do so well in Q1 and you don't do well in Q2, then the 9% to 11% is very conservative.  And another way of asking the same question. Every single time you've given guidance of any sort on EPS since 2018, you're being smooth. This is -- this quarter, you gave guidance. It wasn't a range. It was a point estimate.  You said you were going to do about $1.20 for the fourth quarter, and you said that in December, And yet you beat it very handsomely. Now that would suggest that the way you give guidance is systematically incredibly conservative.  You either you can't forecast, which I don't believe, or you're systematically incredibly conservative. To that point, the fact you've always been conservative with the price very well in Q1 against a really tough comp suggests to me that the guidance for the full year is also super conservative. Is that fair?\nAndre Calantzopoulos: I wouldn't say conservative, but it's not bullish either, okay? I mean, I understand what you are saying, but we're at the beginning of the year, okay? Many things can happen regarding COVID because it's not finished.  So last year, as Emmanuel said, we had more than $150 million exceptional expenses because of COVID, okay? So you need to put some cushion in the bottom line regarding unexpected costs. And if we have a rebound, I would call, not a very gradual recovery, we may need to invest a bit more money towards the end of the year to accelerate acquisition. You can physically do that. If we physically can't, then clearly, the money will go to the bottom line.  So at this stage, we gave this range, okay, which, by the way, if the dollar stays where it is, it's not bad at all because it's 14% to 16%, and the revenue line would be 8% to 11%, which will be phenomenal, I would say. So I don't think this is conservative. It's just I don't have a crystal ball to foresee everything that's happening in every month of this year, okay? We're still not in normal situation. That's all. So I understand and -- but -- and it's just how I can further explain.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Just in the sequence, please factor in that -- I mean, as we say, we talk about a gradual recovery that we are expecting without being able to, of course, design exactly what is going to be the trajectory, but that would mean certainly more investment in H2.  Remember, we've been, of course, limited in commercial activity. As you know, we say H2 could be a better moment overall with a number of restrictions being eased. There will be also more investment skewed towards the second part of the year.  So you have to take that into account, and that explains as well why Q1 maybe is expected today better than one could have expected initially. But the investment will need to happen in the year.\nAndre Calantzopoulos: Any case, I would love to be conservative and as the quarters unfold, we'll get more. But I think I gave the parameters. The pricing, that still can come more favorable. That goes straight to the bottom line. If we have bit more combustible, that's fine. It goes to the bottom line, but we have to assume that. So as the quarters pass, we will give you better outlook.\nOperator: The final question will come from the line of Robert Rampton with UBS.\nRobert Rampton: Hello? Hello?\nOperator: Robert, your line is open.\nRobert Rampton: How to come in the queue actually?\nNicholas Rolli: Operator, can you put Robert Rampton in queue from UBS, please?\nOperator: His line is open.\nNicholas Rolli: Robert, can you join? Okay. We'll get back to Robert after the call, operator. If we can just go to the final remarks. Andre, I think you have some closing remarks.\nAndre Calantzopoulos: Yes. I mean, thank you all for joining. I think we had a rather complicated 2020, but the results came out much better than I would have thought when we were talking for the first time in March.  I think we look at a very good recovery in relative terms in '21. IQOS continues to grow strongly. The momentum is excellent, in my view, and we will see some rebound, hopefully, in cigarette volumes in the next 1 to 2 years. I would love to see positive total market maybe in '22.  And we look forward to sharing with you more on the long-term growth and more on understanding the profitability of IQOS in -- next week, actually. So have a very good day, and thank you for listening to us.\nNicholas Rolli: I just wanted to add that, well, if you have any follow-up questions, you can contact the Investor Relations team and look on our website for the instructions on how to log on to the Investor Day event. It starts at 8:30 Eastern Time on February 10. You can register on our website. And again, thank you very much for joining the call. Have a nice day.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Bye.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

The Marlboro brand is still the major contributor of the overall volumes and the growth, so we're very pleased that on the course of the last year, we continue growing Marlboro.  Obviously, HEETS, which is priced not below the Marlboro had a bit a better dynamics than Marlboro, but the above actually contributing to the growth. And it's very interesting, Vivien. You're asking because this is the first market which we try the dual -- or double -- dual positioning of the consumables, Marlboro and HEETS in Japan.

So it gives you the hint how broadly we now -- why we can go with IQOS touching the segments above medium and below medium. And this is despite, as you know, that we have a competition in Russia. But frankly speaking, competition in terms of the devices is essentially close to 0.  So it's a little bit of a very aggressive promotions, but we continue delivering the strong growth on IQOS, both in terms of user acquisitions measured by the device sales and by the HEETS -- further expansions on the HEETS. And what is also good in places like in Russia that we continue growing in the top cities, which we started a few years ago. So we have a continuous growth in the cities, and the expansion doesn't need from that growth which we have in the Moscow, St. Petersburg and the other main cities."

            "content": "Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I hope everyone listening to the call is safe and well. Our business delivered a robust performance in 2020, despite the unprecedented challenges of the global pandemic. Most impressive was the continued strong growth of IQOS, which made up over 10% of our volumes and almost 1/4 of our net revenues for the year.  The daily consumption of HTUs by IQOS user saw minimal impact from social restriction, and despite significant constraint, we were able to continue acquiring new user in switching from cigarettes at a very good pace to reach a total of 17.6 million, of which 12.7 million have switched to IQOS and stopped smoking.  HTU shipment volumes grew 28% compared to the prior year, with record market shares in key IQOS geographies in Q4. Moreover, 10 markets exited 2020 with double-digit national share in December. Our rate of user acquisition was again strong in Q4, propelled by the increasing sophistication of our digital commercial model and the positive word-of-mouth effect from this increasing prominence, despite tighter restriction in a number of markets. Hi, Bonnie. Sure, Bonnie. Happy to do that. It's going to be only a teaser versus what we're going to see next week. So bear with us, and we'll elaborate with much more detail. But I can certainly anticipate a few headlines on what we'll share next week.  I think what is obvious in our number for 2020 is the fact that, beyond the great performance of IQOS, we have also used efficiency on cost as a powerful lever to generate performance. That's really showing up very clearly in our numbers. So we are delivering in two years, instead of three years, the overall at least $1 billion savings. And what is good is that we are working on cost efficiency on several levels, and many of them, of course, are related to IQOS, but not exclusively to IQOS for some of them.  If you look at the gross margin level, it's quite obvious that we are being very successful in generating manufacturing productivity, and that's a great driver for further margin improvement. And here, we are working globally across the portfolio, I would say, on margin improvement. So it's not just on IQOS, even if probably on IQOS, because that's a business that doesn't have the same maturity, we have more runway, if you want to improve the productivity. And we are certainly making extremely good inroad in that respect, but we are also generating manufacturing productivity on CC.  And then on our SG&A, I think you could identify two drivers on cost efficiency. One, I would say, it's probably something you're going to find in many companies today. We are working to be a more efficient and agile company. So we work on being more digitized, we work on simplifying the way we work, we automate, we standardize, and that is allowing us not to be cost cutter, but just to take cost to be a better company and deliver overall higher performance. And then you have elements that are indeed connected with our commercial performance and not only to IQOS, but certainly mainly to IQOS, and you have two elements. One is all the investment that we made in the past, and that is a great platform on IQOS. And I'm not saying that the investment is over. We're going to keep investing. But, of course, we have now an investment that we amortize over a fast-growing base. And we are not growing the level of investment at the speed of the growth of the IQOS business.  And then there is this great work that we are doing. Thanks to digital and thanks, of course, to all the learnings that we are making on the IQOS business, where we very nicely reduced all the variable per user cost. But I will stop there because we will elaborate on that next week. Thank you, Bonnie. Look, if you bear with us until next week, we'll have a global review of our capital allocation strategy, and we'll address all components at that stage. Well, so for the medium term, again, we'll elaborate next week on more outlook. For the year, Gaurav, I'll let you make your assumption. I think we are clear on the kind of one-off savings that we have seen because of the COVID, so you can factor that in your model. And then I think we are also clear on what are the driver for margin improvement. So it's about the positive impact of the growth of IQOS in terms of per stick revenue, in terms of margin and then everything that is happening on cost efficiency.  That is really what is driving -- that has been driving the margin improvement in 2020, and that will continue in 2021. As you can imagine, beyond 2021, but we'll elaborate on that next week. We're very happy with our partnership in Philippines. Just in the sequence, please factor in that -- I mean, as we say, we talk about a gradual recovery that we are expecting without being able to, of course, design exactly what is going to be the trajectory, but that would mean certainly more investment in H2.  Remember, we've been, of course, limited in commercial activity. As you know, we say H2 could be a better moment overall with a number of restrictions being eased. There will be also more investment skewed towards the second part of the year.  So you have to take that into account, and that explains as well why Q1 maybe is expected today better than one could have expected initially. But the investment will need to happen in the year. Bye."

            "name": "Andre Calantzopoulos",
            "content": "Yes. I'll give you the first shot. I still believe, over the next three years, Bonnie, as I said many times, that heated tobacco technology will be the prevailing technology because it has the highest ability in terms of taste and satisfaction to convert people.  Now in terms of segmentation, I believe, in most markets, we will need one or two heat-not-burn technologies, if I stay with this segment, and probably two to three, over time, consumable price segment, so we can cover mostly the vast majority of the market. There will be exclusions where you need to cover four price segments with probably two technologies. And we'll talk next week about the next step in technology for aerosolization in heat-not-burn, which will address many of the pain points consumers have today.  Now clearly, the heated tobacco product is one category. I think that's the fastest growth, both in terms of revenue and bottom line and volume. The second is obviously e-vapor. We are entering this market because I believe there is consumers there that want to switch trade to these products. There is a lot of dual users, and we see also dual users between heat-not burn and e-vapor that, obviously, we would like to capture. I think we can also capture consumers for every e-vapor products.  The key there is clearly to leverage the infrastructure and the brand name of IQOS. I think the product is very good, and that's the first reactions we get, but we need to build equity because that's a problem for the category, as you know, and also consumer loyalty because for the economics to be at best for e-vapor, you don't only need to be premium positioned, but you also need to have loyal consumers because if you discount just products and you sell them, and then a consumer has 10 different products from 10 different competitors and consumes half a cartridge of your product per week, it's very difficult to make the turn and, more importantly, it's very difficult to maintain an infrastructure. Now we have the advantage of having a lot of infrastructure with IQOS that we can leverage. The equity of IQOS is undeniably the best in the RRP, so I think that's helpful. Technology is good. We are premium, so I think we can make inroads in this category.  And then obviously, we were also going to expand in the pure nicotine products like nicotine pouches or the P3 over time, although I think this is more occasional use products or non-predominant use products. So that's a little bit -- and again, sorry to cut this here, but we're going to elaborate this more -- in more -- extensively next week, okay? Okay. First of all, this is a plan, and there are many positive aspects also in this plan in my view. First of all, we don't talk about taxes. I mean, this is subject to directives. The tobacco excise directive that governs the excise tax and the tobacco product directive, that is the regulation of the products, okay?  The first is the tobacco side directive today does not foresee reduced risk product category, so it has to be amended under all circumstances, okay? And we're not talking about increases. It's creating a framework under which member states can tax.  Our view is that absence of combustion, for example, is a key criteria on how to tax differently cigarettes to other products. And then within that major cliff of change in toxicity and exposure, member states can have different tax rates for these products. But this product should not be, by any means, higher than any combustible category available, okay, as a minimum criteria. But this has to happen.  Nobody said that taxes will increase or hit the tobacco products, frankly speaking, at this stage or in vapor product, okay? So all this has to be defined, and the discussions are going to start in the course of this year and continue in next year, in any case.  So that's for -- and then the tobacco product directive been served, I hope that there will be a bit more regulatory clarity in there regarding RRPs because -- and e-vapor product because just now, we left it up to the member state to regulate, which, frankly speaking, is not harmonizing a directive, one; and secondly is a pain for all the industry participants because every country has a different regulation. And we always advocated serious regulation on these products, provided that this is differentiated from cigarettes, okay?  Now there are voices that say that these products should be the same thing as cigarettes. But at the end of the day, it was very clear also in the cancer plan that all -- in the Q&A that only based on science and evidence, they will take decisions. So I wouldn't be particularly worried about this at this stage. And I think the outcome may be positive actually because it's an opportunity to discuss all these things. Now in the longer term, we discussed very often, I believe tax differentials will be maintained because it makes sense for public health, it makes sense for the consumers. And as we also explained, we have room even to pass taxes if, by any chance, differentials close somehow because IQOS, also in order to pass part of the tax benefit to the consumers, it's mid-price position, essentially, if you take the weighted average of the countries, number one.  And number two, its price productivity is much, much higher than cigarettes, so passing on a tax is triggering less price increase than passing on tax on cigarettes. So that's in a nutshell the way we should look at it, but we have to assume that excise taxes will increase over time also for RRPs as governments need money, and that will apply to heated tobacco products that's already taxed substantially and, potentially, in some cases, to e-vapor products in the future. But that's all baked in, in the assumptions. No, we don't envisage this. Not in the -- I mean if our partner wants to sell one day, we can discuss. At the moment, they're very happy with us. Okay. First of all, we didn't say we will take less pricing. We will also -- where the pricing opportunity, we'll take pricing, and I think the model still works very well. Elasticities are the same, everything.  We had to make some, in my view, reasonable, conservative, you may say, assumptions regarding what's going to happen in Indonesia and Russia because of the tax increase. And Indonesia has never got it carryover from last year, which makes the comparisons year-to-year problematic, okay? Plus, in Germany, we had a VAT, I would say, tax break, which we assume is not going to continue this year. So if you exclude all these elements, I think we're still back to a normal pricing in the other markets.  So clearly, in terms of post-COVID, I would say, assumptions, we have to watch more carefully the price gaps, that's clear, at the mid- to low end of the market, but that doesn't mean that we're going to take any severe pricing decisions at this stage anywhere. I just -- this is a watch out.  If there is down trading, which is happening between the mid-price typically and the low-price segment, also because we have absence of contraband and all these things, that's something to watch in certain markets. But overall, I think we're in good shape.  Also both on IQOS, on heat-not-burn products and combustible, the excise taxes are now in, if I'm not mistaken, everywhere. So we have pretty good visibility of where we are, okay? So I don't think it's super COVID related. What is COVID related in the guidance is the range we gave because if you look, Adam, at what happened last year, if we assume 2% to 3% underlying industry decline, even baking in Indonesia, we had a 6.7% industry decline.  So we're missing consumption for mathematically 3.7%to 4.7%. That's on average, $100 billion for the industry. So we don't -- that will rebound, in my view, one day, but once the restrictions finish.  Now we gave a guidance for this year of 0 to minus 3, which is at 0, you have some recovery. At minus 3, you have super underlying negativity, maybe exaggerated. I don't know at this stage, but that's plus/minus 20 billion units for us. So that's plus/minus 2.5 revenue points.  So that's where the volatility is, okay? And if pricing comes better in Russia and Indonesia, that much the better. We may end up at the high end of the range. I wouldn't say conservative, but it's not bullish either, okay? I mean, I understand what you are saying, but we're at the beginning of the year, okay? Many things can happen regarding COVID because it's not finished.  So last year, as Emmanuel said, we had more than $150 million exceptional expenses because of COVID, okay? So you need to put some cushion in the bottom line regarding unexpected costs. And if we have a rebound, I would call, not a very gradual recovery, we may need to invest a bit more money towards the end of the year to accelerate acquisition. You can physically do that. If we physically can't, then clearly, the money will go to the bottom line.  So at this stage, we gave this range, okay, which, by the way, if the dollar stays where it is, it's not bad at all because it's 14% to 16%, and the revenue line would be 8% to 11%, which will be phenomenal, I would say. So I don't think this is conservative. It's just I don't have a crystal ball to foresee everything that's happening in every month of this year, okay? We're still not in normal situation. That's all. So I understand and -- but -- and it's just how I can further explain. Any case, I would love to be conservative and as the quarters unfold, we'll get more. But I think I gave the parameters. The pricing, that still can come more favorable. That goes straight to the bottom line. If we have bit more combustible, that's fine. It goes to the bottom line, but we have to assume that. So as the quarters pass, we will give you better outlook. Yes. I mean, thank you all for joining. I think we had a rather complicated 2020, but the results came out much better than I would have thought when we were talking for the first time in March.  I think we look at a very good recovery in relative terms in '21. IQOS continues to grow strongly. The momentum is excellent, in my view, and we will see some rebound, hopefully, in cigarette volumes in the next 1 to 2 years. I would love to see positive total market maybe in '22.  And we look forward to sharing with you more on the long-term growth and more on understanding the profitability of IQOS in -- next week, actually. So have a very good day, and thank you for listening to us."

Emmanuel?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. I hope everyone listening to the call and those close to you are safe and well. Our business delivered an even better than expected performance in the third quarter despite the ongoing circumstances of the pandemic. Most importantly, the excellent momentum of IQOS continues. HTU volumes have grown 28% year-to-date with a positive mix effect on our net revenues, where RRPs again made up almost one-quarter of our business in Q3. IQOS user acquisition outpaced the prior year quarter to reach an estimated total of 16.4 million users at the end of September. While still below pre-pandemic levels in most places, our combustible business recorded an improved sequential performance. Underlying industry volumes were better across both developed and emerging markets, reflecting increased consumption occasions. This was notably the case in market with a significant proportion of daily wage workers like Indonesia, Mexico, and the Philippines. Despite these better industry volumes, Indonesia remains challenging together with Duty Free. We must also retain a degree of caution around a second wave of the pandemic and its overall economic consequences across all of our markets. Our operating margins were again significantly ahead in the quarter and on a year to date basis, despite the challenges in our duty-free business. This reflects the increasing weight and profitability of RRPs and cost efficiencies. Our cash generation was also strong with $3.6 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter putting us on track to reach our target of at least $9 billion this year. Turning to the headline numbers, our Q3 net revenue declined by 1.5% on an organic basis, making -- marking a significant improvement from the decline of almost 10% in Q2. While this was somewhat aided by certain timing factors, including the revaluation of distributor inventory in Japan ahead of the October price increase, it nonetheless reflects the continued strength of IQOS combined with a sequential improvement in our combustible business. Indeed, the positive effect of the shift in our sales mix towards RRPs can be seen in the 6.5% organic increase in net revenue per unit. Combustible tobacco pricing was 2.1% up reflecting solid pricing in a number of markets, partially offset by timing differences with the prior year, a strong prior year comparison in Turkey, and headwinds in Indonesia. These timing differences included the effect of delayed pricing in some instances, such as the Philippines where we took a price increase this month rather than August in 2019. Given this net revenue decline, we were pleased to deliver such a strong adjusted operating income margin expansion of over 300 basis points on an organic basis. I will cover this in more detail shortly, noting that we saw a further benefit versus our prior expectation from additional cost efficiencies and some delayed spending in the last month of the quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS of $1.42 increased by 5.6% excluding currency; better than our prior expectation of a flat organic development. The primary driver was the above cost benefit as well as better industry volumes in Indonesia and the EU region, where increased mobility coincided with the reopening of hospitality settings and warm weather. I also want to reflect on our strong performance over the first nine months of the year. This was clearly a challenging period with disruption to many aspects of our operations, including our supply chain and route-to-market. Our net revenue declined by only 0.9% on an organic basis, an exceptionally resilient performance given these unprecedented headwinds. We estimate that Duty Free and Indonesia alone were a mid-single-digit drag on our top line growth. Despite these factors, we saw very good organic progression in our net revenue per unit from the increasing weight of RRPs and solid pricing in combustibles. Our adjusted operating income margin increased by 260 basis points to deliver 7.4% adjusted diluted EPS growth, all on an organic basis. Let me now go into the driver of our Q3 margin expansion in more detail, starting with gross margin, which expanded by 180 basis points on an organic basis. This is driven by multiple levers. First, our ongoing transformation is delivering an increasing mix of RRPs in our business. Second is pricing on combustible. Third is our focus on overall manufacturing productivity, where our focus on efficiency, quality, and footprint more than offset the impact of lower combustible volumes. The positive gross margin development was augmented by our focus on SG&A efficiency with our total marketing administration and research costs, 140 basis points lower as a percentage of net revenues on an organic basis. This reflects the ongoing digitalization and simplification of our business processes, including our RRP commercial engine and more efficient ways of working. There was also a benefit from the timing of certain costs as I already mentioned. Despite the challenges of 2020, we are today raising our expected full year adjusted diluted EPS range to between $5.05 and $5.10, reflecting around 5% to 6% organic growth. This excludes an assumed unfavorable currency impact at prevailing exchange rate of $0.32. As stated in our earnings release, we have also updated certain guidance assumption. We now expect a total industry decline of 7% to 8% and a like-for-like decline in total PMI shipment volume of 8% to 9%, both of which factor in the better Q3 development in the EU and a smaller expected market decline in Indonesia. We assume an organic expansion in our adjusted OI margin of around 200 basis points, also reflecting the above factors and ongoing cost efficiencies. We expect capital expenditure of approximately $0.6 billion and an effective tax rate excluding discrete item of 22% to 23%. We also assume no recurrence of national lockdowns in our key international market in the fourth quarter and remain vigilant with regard to the pandemic as economic uncertainty remains and localized social restrictions are being tightened in some geographies. Focusing now on the fourth quarter, we assume underlying consumption trends should be broadly stable versus a robust Q3. In many markets, including the EU region and Russia increased consumer mobility, the opening of hospitality settings and summer conditions provided a helpful backdrop to our performance. However, there remains continued pandemic-related uncertainty as we now see localized restriction tightening in certain countries with potential impacts on both mobility and economic vitality. The delay of certain SG&A costs from Q3 will also have an impact on our fourth quarter results. In addition, it's worth noting that while the price increase in Japan took effect on the 1st of October, the majority of the impact this year was realized in the third quarter through the revaluation of distributor inventories. I should remind you that Q4 2019 presents a strong base of comparison. This is notably due to pricing in Indonesia ahead of the January 2020 excise tax increase and an exceptional share gain in Saudi Arabia due to market disruption ahead of new plant packaging requirements. As such, while we expect around 5% to 6% organic EPS growth for the year, we expect the organic progression to be flat to modestly negative in the fourth quarter, excluding $0.04 of estimated unfavorable currency. I will now cover our third quarter performance in more detail. As with net revenues, our combustible shipment volumes sequentially improved, albeit the year-over-year decline remains greater than historic average. This was supported by better industry trends in all regions. Conversely, our HTU shipments volume continued to grow strongly to reach a record 19 billion units driven by the EU region, Japan and Russia. I also want to touch on the year-on-year inventory movements in the quarter, which negatively impacted our shipments on both cigarettes and HTUs vis-\u00e0-vis consumer offtake. The reversal of trade build-ups in H1 in markets like Germany and Russia was one contributing factor. Specifically for Japan, there were reduction in distributor inventories in Q3, following increases in both Q1 and Q2 of this year in anticipation of retail and consumer loading before the October tax-driven price increase. As such our shipments in the quarter were less than our in-market sales volume. Importantly, inventories for cigarettes and HTUs in Japan are now aligned to the expected market size following the price increase. The main positive impact of the price increase on our Q3 results was the revaluation of distributor inventory. This strong performance from IQOS means that heated tobacco unit made up over 10% of our total shipment volume in the first nine months of the year as compared to approximately 8% in 2019 and 5% in 2018. We continue to expect this proportion to grow over time as the positive momentum on RRPs continues and remain well on track to achieve our target of 90 billion to 100 billion units in 2021. Our mission is to grow the RRP category globally and transform the mix of our business. With $4.9 billion in sales year-to-date, RRPs are now approaching one quarter of our total net revenues. Indeed, while this percentage was just over 23% in the quarter, if we were to adjust for inventory movements, Q3 would have almost reached 25%. IQOS devices accounted for approximately 8% of RRP net revenue year-to-date, mainly due to a naturally lower ratio of new users to existing users, longer replacement cycle and geographic mix, particularly in the third quarter. In some geographies, we still sell a substantial amount of the lower priced original IQOS 2.4+ device, and we have now introduced lil SOLID in Eastern Europe. The East Asia and Australia region provides an illustration of RRPs operating at scale and is on track to deliver over half its revenue from RRP this year. While the investment phase of building commercial infrastructure can weigh on margin as scale is built, the strong margin expansion over recent years shows how powerful scale and experience in RRP can be as investments start to pay back and the commercial approach is optimized. Focusing now on our total international market share, the developments were very positive for the bulk of our business. Before the impact of Duty Free cigarettes and Indonesia, our share increased by 0.4 points. This was driven by higher share for heated tobacco units, which increased by 0.8 points to reach 3.1%, only partly offset by lower share for cigarettes. In markets where IQOS has a meaningful presence, our share increased with few exceptions. It follows that our combined market shares increase in the EU region, Japan and Russia. However, our total international market share was negatively impacted by Duty Free, where our share is higher than the PMI average, resulting in only partial recapture of volume in other markets, and by Indonesia, which I will come back to separately. It is also true that in many markets, Marlboro over-indexes to social consumption occasion, which are naturally lower during COVID related restriction. While the easing of measures is uneven across market, we saw aggregate Marlboro share start to recover sequentially in the quarter. I turn now to Indonesia. While the challenges related to the excise tax structure remain, underlying consumer trends improved in the quarter. Industry volumes declined by 6% excluding trade inventory movements, a notable improvement from the 22% decline in Q2. This primarily reflects a recovery in daily consumption from depressed level as confinements eased. Given the continued rise in COVID cases and the possibility of more localized restriction, such as those temporarily introduced in Jakarta last months, we do not assume significant further improvement in the fourth quarter. However reflecting the better third quarter industry volume and exit rate, we now expect the total industry decline on a shipment basis to be around 11% for the full year versus 15% previously. While a smaller industry decline has a commensurate effect on our volumes, our market share remains under pressure, despite improved performance from the higher margin A Mild, Dji Sam Soe Magnum and SKT brands. This is due to the same dynamic mentioned last quarter. Most notably, the growth of tax advantage below tier one brands continues as tax-driven pricing and the pandemic have increased downtrading. To illustrate this issue, the tax per stick on our tier one A Mild brand is more than 60% higher than on a comparable tier two kretek brand with a similar resulting difference in the retail selling price. With the segment now at 26% of the market, this represents a serious and growing threat to state excise revenue and a diminishing return on this year's tax increase. The correction of volume-based tax tiers remains urgent. We are hopeful that the government will take steps over time to ensure more predictability in tax revenue and level playing field by reforming the multi-tier excise structure. The process of minimum selling price implementation also continues to progress slowly hampered by the pandemic. Full enforcement may not be complete until the end of the year at the earliest. I move now to our RRP performance. We estimate that there were 16.4 million total IQOS user as of September 30. This represents the addition of around 1.1 million adult users since the end of the second quarter and over 4 million since the same time last year with more users added in both Q3 and year-to-date than the corresponding period in 2019. This is an exceptional achievement given the circumstances, where our accelerated pivot to digital and remote engagement is paying dividends. We further estimate that 72% of this total or 11.7 million adult smokers have stopped smoking and switched to IQOS with the balance in various stages of conversion. This again reflects widespread user growth momentum across all key IQOS geographies, including Japan, the EU region and Russia. As our user base expand in markets like Japan and Russia, we are increasingly enriching our offer and segmenting the market with new product and more price points. We plan to bring more exciting innovation from IQOS in the coming quarters. We are also optimistic that the FDA's granting of Modified Risk Tobacco Product reduced exposure orders for a version of IQOS will contribute over time to better understanding of the heated tobacco category and the benefit of switching to IQOS compared to continued smoking. The success of IQOS in global key cities, where our commercial strategy typically has a strong initial focus, serve as a useful indicator for national share growth potential. In many such cities across a wide range of market, our share is now well into double-digit and still growing. This provides an excellent base from which to further grow our RRP business as we innovate and broaden the IQOS offer. In the EU region, we added a further 0.4 million IQOS user in the third quarter to reach 4.7 million, a continuation of recent strong performance. While most adult menthol smokers have switched to non-menthol cigarettes since the ban in May. We have seen some incremental switching to RRP over the May-September period and continue to see further opportunity to convert these consumers. Third quarter share for HEETS reached 3.9% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume. This was in line with Q2 2020, but sequentially increased by 0.1 point when adjusted for estimated retailer inventory movements and consumer pantry loading effect. Sequential IMS growth, also on an adjusted basis was plus 16%. This reflects strong absolute growth in Italy and Poland. It also include further progress in Spain and in the UK, where both national and London offtake share continue to grow with the latter exceeding 3% in September. I also refer you to the appendix where we show shares for key EU markets. IQOS continued its strong performance in Russia with our HTU share up by 1.8 points to reach 5.8%. On a sequential basis versus the second quarter of 2020, share decreased by 0.2 points reflecting a cigarette market, which grew 6% on the same basis, aided by seasonality of consumption and lower illicit prevalence. Sequential HTU in-market sales, adjusted for trade inventory movements increased by more than 9%. With the introduction of HEETS Creations in Q1 2020 and Fiit consumables for lil SOLID this quarter, we now have a price tiered portfolio to cater to a broader range of adult smokers across the socio-economic spectrum. In Japan, our total reported share for heated tobacco unit reached 20.5% in the third quarter, supported by line extension for both Marlboro HeatSticks and HEETS such as the recent launch of Marlboro Black Menthol. IQOS users grew to an estimated total of 6 million, of which an estimated 4.4 million have stopped smoking and switched to IQOS. On a total tobacco basis, including cigarillos and adjusted for trade inventory movement, the share for our HTU brands increased by 2.6 points versus the prior year quarter and by 0.2 points sequentially to 18.9%. Q3 2020 adjusted in-market sales volume for our HTU brands grew 7.3% sequentially. The overall heated tobacco category continues to grow with the large majority of this growth driven by IQOS and now makes up almost 26% of the total tobacco market. In addition to strong growth in existing markets, the geographic expansion of IQOS continues. We leveraged our digital capabilities to launch in four new emerging markets; Costa Rica, Georgia, Jordan and the Philippines. This takes the total number of markets where IQOS is available for sale to 61, of which over half are outside the OECD. The launch in the Philippines was initiated digitally before adding retail touchpoints and is focused on Metro Manila where consumer purchasing power is higher. While the geographic scope is limited, we are encouraged by progress so far. We have also now started the commercialization of IQOS VEEV, our new evapor product which was launched in New Zealand during the quarter. Initial adult consumer feedback is positive, and we plan to roll out to further markets in Q4 and 2021. The commercial infrastructure of IQOS will allow us to deploy efficiently and at scale. We place great importance on guarding against youth access for all our products. In this category in particular, we will be testing age verification technology in select markets. As part of our mission to build and accelerate the global RRP category, we aim to offer a choice of experiences, formats and price points to adult smokers and consumers of other nicotine products. Our collaboration with KT&G is consistent with this goal, as demonstrated by the first launches of lil products through our IQOS infrastructure. We introduced the lil SOLID heat-not-burn device and Fiit HTUs in both Russia and Ukraine during the quarter. As we reach shares approaching 15% to 20% with IQOS in key cities such as Moscow and Kiev and we expand to areas with lower purchasing power, a simple, affordable proposition can play an important complementary role in reaching more adult consumers and maintaining a strong rate of user acquisition. Early results are encouraging with positive feedback from adult users. This means that in both these markets we now have HTU brands at three price points within the heat-not-burn category. Super-premium HEETS Creations/Dimensions, premium HEETS and mid-priced Fiit, all of which present attractive margins. We will also shortly be launching the lil HYBRID device, Mix consumables and nicotine-free liquid cartridge in two Japanese prefectures, offering adult consumers a differentiated premium experience, which combines the satisfaction and rich flavor of heated tobacco with added sensorial elements. There is a consumer segment in Japan looking for such an experience, and we believe this will be the best hybrid product available in the market. I want now to emphasize the deep alignment of our business with sustainability and ESG objectives, which sit at the core of our mission and strategy. Our most important ESG issue is the health impact of our products. By innovating with significantly better alternatives, such as IQOS, we have a historic opportunity to substantially reduce this impact by switching adult smokers, who would otherwise continue to smoke, to reduced risk products. Through deploying RRPs at scale we can improve public health and contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals, especially Goal 3 Good Health & Well-Being. We also have best-in-class practices across a range of central ESG issues, where the other three of our four sustainability pillars are focused. We believe this provides a unique combination, whereby sustainability is a true driver of innovation and growth. By embedding sustainability into the core of our business, we can create value for our shareholders, and society at large. To conclude, our Q3 results were stronger than expected, and we have raised our full-year guidance to reflect around plus 5% to plus 6% organic EPS growth. We are building a business through RRPs to deliver superior and sustainable growth over the coming years. The continued momentum of IQOS through the challenges of the pandemic demonstrates these structural growth characteristics. We are also committed to maintaining the competitiveness of our combustible business. We have a number of levers for growth in our top and bottom lines. First, the powerful mix effect of RRPs. Second, pricing, which will remain important for combustibles and, where appropriate, for RRPs. Additionally, efficiencies in our manufacturing and SG&A costs are further levers as we continue to hone our business model. Moreover, with the launches of the IQOS VEEV and lil products, we are broadening and stepping up our product offer and innovation in 2021. You can also expect us to bring further exciting innovation to our IQOS heat-not-burn platform. As I just mentioned, sustainability and ESG are at the heart of our smoke-free strategy and we continue to work tirelessly to further our mission. As we all know, there remains continued uncertainty regarding the pandemic, the impact of social restrictions and their economic aftermath. However, when COVID-related headwinds abate we expect to resume growth consistent with the currency-neutral compound annual growth rates in our 2019-2021 algorithm of at least 5% net revenue growth and at least 8% adjusted diluted EPS growth on an organic basis. In short, we look forward with confidence and we will expand on these topics further at our next Investor Day, which we plan to hold in early 2021. Thank you. I am now more than happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now conduct a question-and-answer portion of the conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Spielman of Citi.\nAdam Spielman: Hi. Thank you very much. So, my first question. You've reiterated that you're very, very comfortable with 90 billion to 100 billion target for 2021 for RRPs. Are you still comfortable that you will exceed 250 billion in 2025, which is your other longer-term target? That's my first question. Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thanks, Adam. We definitely are repeating our ambition to reach next year 20 -- 200 billion stick in the heat-not-burn category, and I think that the growth that we deliver quarter-after-quarter is clearly pointing to that direction. Then you are alluding to the 2025 objective of 250 billion plus, which is I think here aligned with what I've started to detail on the presentation, which is really the fact that we are broadening the portfolio when it comes to RRPs product, and we are going to of course come with more enrichment, more segmentation, more offering when it comes to heat-not-burn. We are entering the evaping category, and all that is going to put us on the track to deliver that ambition. And I think everything I've been seeing in term of segmentation of the devices now that we are coming with the lil offering, what we have started to do now in Japan, in Russia, when it comes to the consumables, it shows that clearly now the market is getting a bit more mature, of course, it's still at an early stage in most places, but in a few places we have some first element of a bigger market, it is time now to enrich the offering and broaden the spectrum of what we can offer to, I would say, concur and convince more smoker to switch to our product, and therefore that is what is going to put us on the right track for this ambition for 2025.\nAdam Spielman: Excellent. Thank you very much. And then [indiscernible] I don\u2019t want to remind you, I want to put words in your mouth, but your market shares in Russia and Japan, they grew in Q3, but sequentially less than in Q2. And I'm wondering why that was do you think, and whether it really is significant or it's just sort of random quarterly fluctuations and we should just ignore that one?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes, I don't think that there is anything to be read there. I think that we are very happy with the performance on the key market. Of course, you know what has been and depending on the season and the consumption pattern and what has been happening on the borders, we know that some borders were closed. We talked about illicit trade being stopped, I mean, that can be disruptors to the evolution if you take a kind of flash or split quarter view. But I would say the trend that we are seeing in Q3, we are very much in line with a nice strong trend that we've been observing over the first part of the year over H1. So, I don't think that there is anything in Q3 that would be signaling a slowdown in the way we are gaining share in an underlying manner.\nAdam Spielman: Thank you. Very clear, very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Pamela Kaufman of Morgan Stanley.\nPamela Kaufman: Hi. Good morning. So, there is obviously a lot of ongoing uncertainty, but as you just reiterated, you are on track for your heated tobacco target for 2021. I guess broadly how are you thinking about how you're positioned for growth next year and do you anticipate accelerating growth as you lapped the performance this year and see benefits from the enforcement of minimum price increases in Indonesia?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Well, thanks for the question. Obviously, it's very early stage to start talking about next year. I think you very rightly said it, 2021 is full of uncertainty and we even recognized that the last months of 2020 has a fair share of uncertainty as well. So, difficult to of course start to elaborate on 2021. The only thing I can say at this stage is that we are going to enter 2021 with the strength of our RRP business that is clear from this first nine months performance. There will be certainly a number of low comps in the basis of 2020, but as we don't know how the markets are going to be in 2021, and if I take the example of duty-free, which of course you could say we're going to have nine months with very, very low business in duty-free in 2020. So, one could argue well that's an easy basis of comparison, but nobody is able to say today what's going to be the rebound next year of duty-free. So, it's just difficult to say which kind of growth trajectory at that stage it designs if you want. I hope we'll know more at the beginning of 2021, when we will comment on our full-year 2020, and at that stage we can share more details with you, but I think that for us, the main element today that I would say is a kind of for sure whatever is the environment, it is a very, very strong performance of our heat-not-burn business.\nPamela Kaufman: Thank you. And also obviously very strong margin performance in the quarter. Can you elaborate on the factors that contributed to that in terms of lower marketing and administrative costs? You pointed out manufacturing efficiencies. How are your IQOS customer acquisition costs trending and how much of the lower cost is temporary versus sustainable going forward?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Sure, happy to do that. Well, the margin improvement is and that's probably the strength of the performance is not coming from one element. I think it's a collection of drivers that we have to add to the topline evolution, nice margin evolution. And that is coming first, of course, from the growth of RRPs, and I think we are showing this quarter's impact on the gross margin of the positive impact on the mix of the consumable in heat-not-burn. And as we keep growing the business that is of course a nice mix positive impact, clearly helping the margin. There is also everything we are doing on price and we keep clearly working in the direction of improving nicely price on combustible. There is -- and I would be happy to elaborate further if you want. Then there is, of course, everything we do on manufacturing productivity, which is also a nice driver, and then below the gross profit, you're right, we have this very positive evolution of our SG&A, where we managed to decrease on an organic basis SG&A by about 7% when the decrease of the topline is only 1.5%. So, we have a nice leverage if you want between the two. And here you have a mix of things. First of all, yes, of course, we are working on the efficiency of our -- all functions, all teams are working on working in a simpler, more efficient, more digitized manner. We are platforming our work. We are standardizing, we are automating, we are using digital in all capacity in order to work in a more efficient manner. So that is contributing to certainly some saving. Then on top of all this effort, you're absolutely right. We have increased efficiency as we turn toward a more digital commercial engine on RRPs. And that is of course something that is going to accompany us on the long term. We build at the origin the IQOS business with a business model you know with a lot of physical cultures and based on having some retail places that we were owning and that was great to start. We needed to do that, but of course, as we are growing the market, as we are learning about it and as we are developing our digital skills, we are indeed developing a tool, which is really efficient both in term of digital customer experience and in term of digital trade experience and that is allowing us to be much more efficient in contacting smoker that we can convince to switch to IQOS in explaining and accompanying them on answering all their question and coaching them in a digital manner for them to understand how it works, how it is a global experience. To answer that question, we have been creating communities where people switching to IQOS can exchange their impressions and their tips. And then once it is done, of course, the job is not done and we are moving to retention and really build this intimacy through having a lot of data about our customer of IQOS and really being able to bring them the best overall experience and keep them as customer of our heat-not-burn business. So that's what we are doing today and absolutely that is translating into reduced cost of acquisition and reduced cost of retention. We are certainly not at the end of this improvement, but that is nicely helping the performance in 2020 for sure.\nPamela Kaufman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of Piper Sandler.\nMichael Lavery: Good morning. Thank you. You've launched in some markets this year and certainly it doesn't seem like the easiest of circumstances to really get those going with pandemic closures and restrictions, but you've got some like Saudi Arabia already at 40 basis points of share obviously small, but France took several years to get to that. Mexico also 20 basis points. It's early but these look like they're a pretty good start. Can you touch on some of what's driving that? I know you just mentioned some of the digital things. Is that really the key, are there other factors? What's just getting some of these markets going a little bit more quickly than we've seen in the past?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Well, I think it's -- each market Michael is different. So the answer probably could require long explanation and entering the various type of dynamic. And starting with the regulation, of course, the capacity that we have to speak about IQOS and explain how it works. In some market we have this capacity to explain to smoker that a better alternative does exist in other country, we are much more limited. So that is clearly having an impact. Then certainly there is an impact as you grow the visibility of IQOS, as you people starting to see friends, family around them using IQOS, you may have a kind of snowball effect maybe it's a little bit of a caricature, but I think to some extent it can play like that and that can accelerate the evolution of the market. You have also the cultural dimension, which is quite important, in some country people will be proud of having discovered IQOS and they will want to share that with their friends and they will become our best salespeople I would say about IQOS and taking themselves the time to explain and convince friends and relatives. In other culture, it would be very different and that won't happen because they will believe that it's a personal choice and they don't want to interfere on that. So, all that to explain the very different pattern that we are seeing in terms of development of the business. Having said that, you're absolutely right. The more we're going to be able to go digital and have great digital tool to contact smokers talk about IQOS be able to engage them in what is the IQOS experience. The more we are going to be able to grow the market and clearly developing the digital customer experience is going to be key hopefully in accelerating the growth in several market. But let's not underestimate the fact that regulation can be a pretty significant restriction nevertheless even when it comes to using digital tools. So again that explain why I think there is certainly no market where we are not seeing that we have the ambition to make them RRP market, but certainly in some market it's going to take a bit more time.\nMichael Lavery: Okay, that's helpful. And then we're about five months into the menthol ban in the EU for cigarettes. You mentioned a little bit of incremental momentum on IQOS menthol especially in a market like Poland. There's been a big share jump there. How much is that related to menthol success getting cigarette smokers to switch and how much more runway is there for that to go?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Sure, Michael. What I can share with you is that, so you remember that menthol was roughly speaking 10% of the EU market altogether. I think the vast majority of the menthol smokers have been switching to other type of combustible cigarettes. And so I don't think that there has been certainly not maybe what was all in term of people stopping to smoke. It's probably a few percent, but no more than that. And when it comes to switching to other alternative like heat-not-burn and IQOS in particular maybe around 5% of the people have done that so far. It doesn't mean that we are giving up. We think that we can certainly convince more people, but I think the impact has been relatively limited. You're right; probably helping a little bit in Poland. Maybe in the UK as well which two big market for menthol. But I would not say that it has been having a big, big positive impact so far on our IQOS business.\nMichael Lavery: Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.\nVivien Azer: Hi, good morning. I appreciate all the detail around digitization and IQOS user engagement seemingly a lot of the hard investments you guys made early and then the incremental investments are paying off. I was wondering if we could kind of pull that altogether and perhaps quantify the evolution that your IQOS user acquisition costs in particular over the course of 2020 given COVID? Thanks.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Well, I understand the question, but at that stage you know I think we are not going to enter into more granularity. I think we are giving through this set of numbers and presentation more detail on the driver for profitability. So I'm sure that you are able to capture through the gross margin evolution and other element that we are giving some elements. But it's obviously, as you can imagine, a relatively strategic information sensitive and therefore it's not something that we can share, but I'm certainly happy to confirm that we are seeing a significant decrease and that we have ambition for more significant decrease in the future. So I'm just reiterating my comment that you should expect more improvement on the ramping up of the profitability of our RRP business in the future, which is really great because we are combining a big, big driver for the top line growth quite obviously and in addition, a nice driver for profitability improvement.\nVivien Azer: Okay, that's fair. Thank you very much. My second question is just on price gaps in the heat-not-burn category, it makes a lot of sense to me that you would want to introduce a tiered portfolio as your penetration continues to mature, if you will. How are you thinking about those price gaps relative to combustibles though? I mean you've used the same kind of descriptive language in terms of the price segmentation in Russia. Are we meant to take that to understand that you're going to match price gaps against combustibles with a tiered heat-not-burn consumable portfolio or is there a reason to think it might vary? Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Well, as you know, globally we have a position because it deserves it. Our RRP business as a premium business. It's a unique consumer experience and that fully justify a premium price positioning. Now, of course, as you know in some country as well, the excise duty level is lower, sometime materially lower on RRPs and heat-not-burn then on combustible cigarettes. And therefore that is also justifying a lower price point. So, I would say, as a rule we have our combustible that are priced at the price on Marlboro or sometimes even a bit below Marlboro and I think it's a good positioning. The sweet spot to really reflect the overall experience and the value for the consumer, but also the specificity of the heat-not-burn category and heat-not-burn products. And in segmentation, we are going to do the same. It's of course related to the customer expense as well and all three consumable are under the same and not deliver the same experience. And exactly like we have been doing for decades on consumable depending on the level of, I would say, benefit value for the consumer. We know what is perceiving the overall pleasure and positive dimension for him. We'll have different price positioning that will be aligned with that. I don't think we should expect anything really materially different there.\nVivien Azer: Understood. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you. Hello, Emmanuel.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Hi, Bonnie.\nBonnie Herzog: Hi. Your quarter was stronger than expected and you're seeing a better demand environment and then you also took up guidance again. So I guess I'd like to get your thoughts on resuming your share buyback program and if this might be realistic next year? It seems like you have flexibility and I guess I think of it as an important positive signal for the market that probably would be viewed favorably. So I just think it would probably help to support your stock price. So I'd love to hear what your current thinking is on this?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thanks for the question, Bonnie. We haven't changed our mind at that stage on the buyback and we've announced as you know 2.6% increase of the dividend to $4.80 a year. So we continue to reward the shareholders. And I think we stated in the past and we are very much on that line that we would not start to share buyback that could potentially endanger the rating. And I'm not sure that today we have a huge flexibility on that rating with the balance sheet that we have today. So we have a very strong balance sheet and we want to keep that. I don't think that we would love to be losing some nudging the rating because of buyback. So I'm not closing the door on the long term of course it's a moving situation. And as we keep generating cash and strengthening the balance sheet, we may together with the Board decide to change that, but for the time being, this is not on the agenda.\nBonnie Herzog: Okay, that's helpful. And then I know it's early, but I was hoping to get maybe your thoughts on what you see as the key tailwinds or maybe headwinds as we look out into '21? I guess as I'm thinking about your business and what you've accomplished during this pandemic? It seems like the setup is quite positive especially as I think through a few tailwinds, such as, for instance the one you have in Japan. I'm not asking for guidance for next year, but is there a way that you could just kind of layout a few of these tailwinds as you see them for your business and/or possibly headwinds? Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thanks Bonnie for not asking for a guidance because we will not give you anyway. Trying to elaborate on tailwind and headwinds. I think the tailwinds are quite obvious. We have this RRP business that is you know almost one-fourth of the business. So it's very material in term of share of revenue, that is going very strongly. We talk about growth of about 28%, 29% year-to-date. We see a number of market that are actually contributing to the dynamism. We are, as we said, enriching the offers. So we see that we start to enter into new phase of this ambition of creating this category that we think one day will be, I would say, putting an end to a smoking world by this segmentation enrichment of the offer. So we have here a very powerful tailwind that is going to help us as we enter into 2021. And as you have seen, it's not only, as I said positive for the top line, but it also nicely positive for the bottom line, because we are ramping up the profitability on that business and that is a business that has the potential to be super nicely profitable. Then of course you know I said it you have all these very low comps that we're going to have in few markets. We have this Q2 that has been very difficult. You have the duty-free business that is extremely depressed. So one could argue that if things were to start gradually in 2021 to be back to normal, but that could provide easy comp for growth. Now that unfortunately the segue for headwinds, because we don't know what's going to be the environment. More and more people are saying that we're not going to be back to normal maybe until the summer of 2021. Nobody knows what exactly it means, by the way, but people are saying, when the vaccine will be available, which could be summer 2021. That's a condition to be back to some more normality and therefore we don't know how it's going to play out globally on the business. But I think we are taking comfort and confidence from the fact that I mean the 2020 will not have been a walk in the park, that for sure, and despite that, we are delivering what I consider to be a robust performance and targeting our nice organic growth for the adjusted EPS. So it shows that even in a difficult environment, we managed to deliver a nice performance.\nBonnie Herzog: All right, very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gaurav Jain of Barclays.\nGaurav Jain: Hi, good morning, Emmanuel. So couple of questions. One is on the CapEx. So CapEx was again reduced to $600 million and now it is meaningfully below depreciation, which runs at about $950 million for your company. So is this the new run rate of CapEx and can you depreciate a step down in the future?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Sure, Gaurav. So, no, this is not the new normal for the company. We are obviously going through stormy water. So it's an adjustment and there is number of project by the way that given the environment we prefer to postpone, so that explain why we are now targeting $0.6 billion for the year. I think you can expect us when we are back to a more normal environment, to be back to a more normal CapEx amount that I would say probably to be around $0.8 billion. So that could stay below the level. You're right of amortization and depreciation that is north of $900 million today. And of course overtime if it continues like that, that will mean that this amount will decrease as well. You're absolutely right. I'm not able to give you a phasing for that, but that should be over time a natural evolution though of course with the carryover effect it will take some time.\nGaurav Jain: Sure. And my second question is on your travel retail business, where you have booked zero revenues on high cost in the Middle East and Africa line. And clearly the market is not down 100%. So you are supplying out of inventory. So is there any risk of inventory write-down in travel retail?\nEmmanuel Babeau: I think at the end of September, we have been taking care of the potential impact of that. So I would not expect anything major for the rest of the year.\nGaurav Jain: Okay, brilliant. Thanks a lot.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.\nChris Growe: Hi, good morning, Emmanuel.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Hi, Chris.\nChris Growe: Hi. I just had a question for you, if I could on some of the inventory adjustments that occurred in the quarter. And just to understand so IQOS had an inventory drag that weighed on its volume in the quarter that you reported an even stronger performance for that brand excluding the inventory changes. Our inventory say for IQOS I guess I'd be curious for your business overall. Are they at the right level or are there expected changes to occur in the fourth quarter on inventory perhaps to building inventory?\nEmmanuel Babeau: No, Chris. I think that you're right. And I think we flagged in H1 that there was a number of country with some anticipation on inventory. We got the reversal of that in Q3. You're right. If you retreat the shipment by that, we have a record around 20.5 billion stick of in-market sales which is, I mean, it's quite a symbolic threshold, but to be above $20 billion is quite nice, and we believe that we are globally at the right level at the end of September. So we're not expecting today in Q4 any material impact on inventory for heat-not-burn.\nChris Growe: Okay, thank you. And then, just a second question on VEEV and kind of just to understand the degree to which you can undertake a wider scale launch in more markets in the fourth quarter. Are there production limitations? There obviously I'm sure there are at this point, but just to understand how you think about the progression of that launch in more markets starting in the fourth quarter?\nEmmanuel Babeau: So there could be very limited number of market launch in Q4. I think we're taking the time to have all the lesson learned from what we've seen in New Zealand to make sure that when we launch, we are super ready and very successful. There is certainly things around age verification on which we are still working and which are very important for us as you know. So we are still working on these various dimension. So don't expect too much in Q4. I think the big new launches will be more for 2021.\nChris Growe: Okay, thank you for your time.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Owen Bennett of Jefferies.\nOwen Bennett: Afternoon, Emmanuel. Hope you're well.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Owen, hi.\nOwen Bennett: And first question please. I just wanted to come back to Adams in the $250 billion target by 2025. So you mentioned the role, the expansion of the portfolio into evapor will here and obviously very different economics between heated and vapor. So how do you see that $250 billion being split between the two categories? I know very early days, but I'm kind of a rough idea internally how you see that evolving?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Sure. And so we haven't been splitting the $250 billion. So I won't do it now. I think we believe that quite obviously each RRP category has a play in getting there, but there is no doubt that we continue to see the heat-not-burn category as being I would say the majority of this $250 billion. So we certainly intend to develop e-vaping and IQOS VEEV and other things that we could launch from now until 2025. But I think you should expect still a big part of this -- a big majority of the $250 billion to come from heat-not-burn. Remember I mean this is an aspiration that we've been sharing. I think as we progress we'll make sure that we put more detail around that. So bear with us. We're going to certainly continue to give more vision, more visibility. But at this stage I cannot split further the $250 billion and quite obviously we want to develop things in a profitable manner. So that also drives the choices and the final number in the split of the $250 billion.\nOwen Bennett: Okay, thank you. And second one; I was hoping you could give me the ex-inventory heated volumes in Eastern Europe that Q1, Q2 and Q3 you just see how that kind of progressing shipping the inventory impacts out?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Well, I don't have that with me, but I can see with the team maybe as to whether there is something that we can find the one for you.\nOwen Bennett: Okay, great. Thanks very much. I appreciate it.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: And, thank you, we have reached the allotted time for questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.\nNick Rolli: Thank you very much. That concludes our call for today. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations team. Thank you again, and have a great day.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you all. Talk to you soon. Bye.\nOperator: And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's call. You may now disconnect.",

Our business delivered an even better than expected performance in the third quarter despite the ongoing circumstances of the pandemic. Most importantly, the excellent momentum of IQOS continues. HTU volumes have grown 28% year-to-date with a positive mix effect on our net revenues, where RRPs again made up almost one-quarter of our business in Q3. IQOS user acquisition outpaced the prior year quarter to reach an estimated total of 16.4 million users at the end of September. While still below pre-pandemic levels in most places, our combustible business recorded an improved sequential performance. Underlying industry volumes were better across both developed and emerging markets, reflecting increased consumption occasions. This was notably the case in market with a significant proportion of daily wage workers like Indonesia, Mexico, and the Philippines. Despite these better industry volumes, Indonesia remains challenging together with Duty Free. We must also retain a degree of caution around a second wave of the pandemic and its overall economic consequences across all of our markets. Our operating margins were again significantly ahead in the quarter and on a year to date basis, despite the challenges in our duty-free business. This reflects the increasing weight and profitability of RRPs and cost efficiencies. Our cash generation was also strong with $3.6 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter putting us on track to reach our target of at least $9 billion this year. Turning to the headline numbers, our Q3 net revenue declined by 1.5% on an organic basis, making -- marking a significant improvement from the decline of almost 10% in Q2. While this was somewhat aided by certain timing factors, including the revaluation of distributor inventory in Japan ahead of the October price increase, it nonetheless reflects the continued strength of IQOS combined with a sequential improvement in our combustible business. Indeed, the positive effect of the shift in our sales mix towards RRPs can be seen in the 6.5% organic increase in net revenue per unit. Combustible tobacco pricing was 2.1% up reflecting solid pricing in a number of markets, partially offset by timing differences with the prior year, a strong prior year comparison in Turkey, and headwinds in Indonesia. These timing differences included the effect of delayed pricing in some instances, such as the Philippines where we took a price increase this month rather than August in 2019. Given this net revenue decline, we were pleased to deliver such a strong adjusted operating income margin expansion of over 300 basis points on an organic basis. I will cover this in more detail shortly, noting that we saw a further benefit versus our prior expectation from additional cost efficiencies and some delayed spending in the last month of the quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS of $1.42 increased by 5.6% excluding currency; better than our prior expectation of a flat organic development. The primary driver was the above cost benefit as well as better industry volumes in Indonesia and the EU region, where increased mobility coincided with the reopening of hospitality settings and warm weather. I also want to reflect on our strong performance over the first nine months of the year. This was clearly a challenging period with disruption to many aspects of our operations, including our supply chain and route-to-market. Our net revenue declined by only 0.9% on an organic basis, an exceptionally resilient performance given these unprecedented headwinds. We estimate that Duty Free and Indonesia alone were a mid-single-digit drag on our top line growth. Despite these factors, we saw very good organic progression in our net revenue per unit from the increasing weight of RRPs and solid pricing in combustibles. Our adjusted operating income margin increased by 260 basis points to deliver 7.4% adjusted diluted EPS growth, all on an organic basis. Let me now go into the driver of our Q3 margin expansion in more detail, starting with gross margin, which expanded by 180 basis points on an organic basis. This is driven by multiple levers. First, our ongoing transformation is delivering an increasing mix of RRPs in our business. Second is pricing on combustible. Third is our focus on overall manufacturing productivity, where our focus on efficiency, quality, and footprint more than offset the impact of lower combustible volumes. The positive gross margin development was augmented by our focus on SG&A efficiency with our total marketing administration and research costs, 140 basis points lower as a percentage of net revenues on an organic basis. This reflects the ongoing digitalization and simplification of our business processes, including our RRP commercial engine and more efficient ways of working. There was also a benefit from the timing of certain costs as I already mentioned. Despite the challenges of 2020, we are today raising our expected full year adjusted diluted EPS range to between $5.05 and $5.10, reflecting around 5% to 6% organic growth. This excludes an assumed unfavorable currency impact at prevailing exchange rate of $0.32. As stated in our earnings release, we have also updated certain guidance assumption. We now expect a total industry decline of 7% to 8% and a like-for-like decline in total PMI shipment volume of 8% to 9%, both of which factor in the better Q3 development in the EU and a smaller expected market decline in Indonesia. We assume an organic expansion in our adjusted OI margin of around 200 basis points, also reflecting the above factors and ongoing cost efficiencies. We expect capital expenditure of approximately $0.6 billion and an effective tax rate excluding discrete item of 22% to 23%. We also assume no recurrence of national lockdowns in our key international market in the fourth quarter and remain vigilant with regard to the pandemic as economic uncertainty remains and localized social restrictions are being tightened in some geographies. Focusing now on the fourth quarter, we assume underlying consumption trends should be broadly stable versus a robust Q3. In many markets, including the EU region and Russia increased consumer mobility, the opening of hospitality settings and summer conditions provided a helpful backdrop to our performance. However, there remains continued pandemic-related uncertainty as we now see localized restriction tightening in certain countries with potential impacts on both mobility and economic vitality. The delay of certain SG&A costs from Q3 will also have an impact on our fourth quarter results. In addition, it's worth noting that while the price increase in Japan took effect on the 1st of October, the majority of the impact this year was realized in the third quarter through the revaluation of distributor inventories. I should remind you that Q4 2019 presents a strong base of comparison. This is notably due to pricing in Indonesia ahead of the January 2020 excise tax increase and an exceptional share gain in Saudi Arabia due to market disruption ahead of new plant packaging requirements. As such, while we expect around 5% to 6% organic EPS growth for the year, we expect the organic progression to be flat to modestly negative in the fourth quarter, excluding $0.04 of estimated unfavorable currency. I will now cover our third quarter performance in more detail. As with net revenues, our combustible shipment volumes sequentially improved, albeit the year-over-year decline remains greater than historic average. This was supported by better industry trends in all regions. Conversely, our HTU shipments volume continued to grow strongly to reach a record 19 billion units driven by the EU region, Japan and Russia. I also want to touch on the year-on-year inventory movements in the quarter, which negatively impacted our shipments on both cigarettes and HTUs vis-a\u0300-vis consumer offtake. The reversal of trade build-ups in H1 in markets like Germany and Russia was one contributing factor. Specifically for Japan, there were reduction in distributor inventories in Q3, following increases in both Q1 and Q2 of this year in anticipation of retail and consumer loading before the October tax-driven price increase. As such our shipments in the quarter were less than our in-market sales volume. Importantly, inventories for cigarettes and HTUs in Japan are now aligned to the expected market size following the price increase. The main positive impact of the price increase on our Q3 results was the revaluation of distributor inventory. This strong performance from IQOS means that heated tobacco unit made up over 10% of our total shipment volume in the first nine months of the year as compared to approximately 8% in 2019 and 5% in 2018. We continue to expect this proportion to grow over time as the positive momentum on RRPs continues and remain well on track to achieve our target of 90 billion to 100 billion units in 2021. Our mission is to grow the RRP category globally and transform the mix of our business. With $4.9 billion in sales year-to-date, RRPs are now approaching one quarter of our total net revenues. Indeed, while this percentage was just over 23% in the quarter, if we were to adjust for inventory movements, Q3 would have almost reached 25%. IQOS devices accounted for approximately 8% of RRP net revenue year-to-date, mainly due to a naturally lower ratio of new users to existing users, longer replacement cycle and geographic mix, particularly in the third quarter. In some geographies, we still sell a substantial amount of the lower priced original IQOS 2.4+ device, and we have now introduced lil SOLID in Eastern Europe. The East Asia and Australia region provides an illustration of RRPs operating at scale and is on track to deliver over half its revenue from RRP this year. While the investment phase of building commercial infrastructure can weigh on margin as scale is built, the strong margin expansion over recent years shows how powerful scale and experience in RRP can be as investments start to pay back and the commercial approach is optimized. Focusing now on our total international market share, the developments were very positive for the bulk of our business. Before the impact of Duty Free cigarettes and Indonesia, our share increased by 0.4 points. This was driven by higher share for heated tobacco units, which increased by 0.8 points to reach 3.1%, only partly offset by lower share for cigarettes. In markets where IQOS has a meaningful presence, our share increased with few exceptions. It follows that our combined market shares increase in the EU region, Japan and Russia. However, our total international market share was negatively impacted by Duty Free, where our share is higher than the PMI average, resulting in only partial recapture of volume in other markets, and by Indonesia, which I will come back to separately. It is also true that in many markets, Marlboro over-indexes to social consumption occasion, which are naturally lower during COVID related restriction. While the easing of measures is uneven across market, we saw aggregate Marlboro share start to recover sequentially in the quarter. I turn now to Indonesia. While the challenges related to the excise tax structure remain, underlying consumer trends improved in the quarter. Industry volumes declined by 6% excluding trade inventory movements, a notable improvement from the 22% decline in Q2. This primarily reflects a recovery in daily consumption from depressed level as confinements eased. Given the continued rise in COVID cases and the possibility of more localized restriction, such as those temporarily introduced in Jakarta last months, we do not assume significant further improvement in the fourth quarter. However reflecting the better third quarter industry volume and exit rate, we now expect the total industry decline on a shipment basis to be around 11% for the full year versus 15% previously. While a smaller industry decline has a commensurate effect on our volumes, our market share remains under pressure, despite improved performance from the higher margin A Mild, Dji Sam Soe Magnum and SKT brands. This is due to the same dynamic mentioned last quarter. Most notably, the growth of tax advantage below tier one brands continues as tax-driven pricing and the pandemic have increased downtrading. To illustrate this issue, the tax per stick on our tier one A Mild brand is more than 60% higher than on a comparable tier two kretek brand with a similar resulting difference in the retail selling price. With the segment now at 26% of the market, this represents a serious and growing threat to state excise revenue and a diminishing return on this year's tax increase. The correction of volume-based tax tiers remains urgent. We are hopeful that the government will take steps over time to ensure more predictability in tax revenue and level playing field by reforming the multi-tier excise structure. The process of minimum selling price implementation also continues to progress slowly hampered by the pandemic. Full enforcement may not be complete until the end of the year at the earliest. I move now to our RRP performance. We estimate that there were 16.4 million total IQOS user as of September 30. This represents the addition of around 1.1 million adult users since the end of the second quarter and over 4 million since the same time last year with more users added in both Q3 and year-to-date than the corresponding period in 2019. This is an exceptional achievement given the circumstances, where our accelerated pivot to digital and remote engagement is paying dividends. We further estimate that 72% of this total or 11.7 million adult smokers have stopped smoking and switched to IQOS with the balance in various stages of conversion. This again reflects widespread user growth momentum across all key IQOS geographies, including Japan, the EU region and Russia. As our user base expand in markets like Japan and Russia, we are increasingly enriching our offer and segmenting the market with new product and more price points. We plan to bring more exciting innovation from IQOS in the coming quarters. We are also optimistic that the FDA's granting of Modified Risk Tobacco Product reduced exposure orders for a version of IQOS will contribute over time to better understanding of the heated tobacco category and the benefit of switching to IQOS compared to continued smoking. The success of IQOS in global key cities, where our commercial strategy typically has a strong initial focus, serve as a useful indicator for national share growth potential. In many such cities across a wide range of market, our share is now well into double-digit and still growing. This provides an excellent base from which to further grow our RRP business as we innovate and broaden the IQOS offer. In the EU region, we added a further 0.4 million IQOS user in the third quarter to reach 4.7 million, a continuation of recent strong performance. While most adult menthol smokers have switched to non-menthol cigarettes since the ban in May. We have seen some incremental switching to RRP over the May-September period and continue to see further opportunity to convert these consumers. Third quarter share for HEETS reached 3.9% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume. This was in line with Q2 2020, but sequentially increased by 0.1 point when adjusted for estimated retailer inventory movements and consumer pantry loading effect. Sequential IMS growth, also on an adjusted basis was plus 16%. This reflects strong absolute growth in Italy and Poland. It also include further progress in Spain and in the UK, where both national and London offtake share continue to grow with the latter exceeding 3% in September. I also refer you to the appendix where we show shares for key EU markets. IQOS continued its strong performance in Russia with our HTU share up by 1.8 points to reach 5.8%. On a sequential basis versus the second quarter of 2020, share decreased by 0.2 points reflecting a cigarette market, which grew 6% on the same basis, aided by seasonality of consumption and lower illicit prevalence. Sequential HTU in-market sales, adjusted for trade inventory movements increased by more than 9%. With the introduction of HEETS Creations in Q1 2020 and Fiit consumables for lil SOLID this quarter, we now have a price tiered portfolio to cater to a broader range of adult smokers across the socio-economic spectrum. In Japan, our total reported share for heated tobacco unit reached 20.5% in the third quarter, supported by line extension for both Marlboro HeatSticks and HEETS such as the recent launch of Marlboro Black Menthol. IQOS users grew to an estimated total of 6 million, of which an estimated 4.4 million have stopped smoking and switched to IQOS. On a total tobacco basis, including cigarillos and adjusted for trade inventory movement, the share for our HTU brands increased by 2.6 points versus the prior year quarter and by 0.2 points sequentially to 18.9%. Q3 2020 adjusted in-market sales volume for our HTU brands grew 7.3% sequentially. The overall heated tobacco category continues to grow with the large majority of this growth driven by IQOS and now makes up almost 26% of the total tobacco market. In addition to strong growth in existing markets, the geographic expansion of IQOS continues. We leveraged our digital capabilities to launch in four new emerging markets; Costa Rica, Georgia, Jordan and the Philippines. This takes the total number of markets where IQOS is available for sale to 61, of which over half are outside the OECD. The launch in the Philippines was initiated digitally before adding retail touchpoints and is focused on Metro Manila where consumer purchasing power is higher. While the geographic scope is limited, we are encouraged by progress so far. We have also now started the commercialization of IQOS VEEV, our new evapor product which was launched in New Zealand during the quarter. Initial adult consumer feedback is positive, and we plan to roll out to further markets in Q4 and 2021. The commercial infrastructure of IQOS will allow us to deploy efficiently and at scale. We place great importance on guarding against youth access for all our products. In this category in particular, we will be testing age verification technology in select markets. As part of our mission to build and accelerate the global RRP category, we aim to offer a choice of experiences, formats and price points to adult smokers and consumers of other nicotine products. Our collaboration with KT&G is consistent with this goal, as demonstrated by the first launches of lil products through our IQOS infrastructure. We introduced the lil SOLID heat-not-burn device and Fiit HTUs in both Russia and Ukraine during the quarter. As we reach shares approaching 15% to 20% with IQOS in key cities such as Moscow and Kiev and we expand to areas with lower purchasing power, a simple, affordable proposition can play an important complementary role in reaching more adult consumers and maintaining a strong rate of user acquisition. Early results are encouraging with positive feedback from adult users. This means that in both these markets we now have HTU brands at three price points within the heat-not-burn category. Super-premium HEETS Creations/Dimensions, premium HEETS and mid-priced Fiit, all of which present attractive margins. We will also shortly be launching the lil HYBRID device, Mix consumables and nicotine-free liquid cartridge in two Japanese prefectures, offering adult consumers a differentiated premium experience, which combines the satisfaction and rich flavor of heated tobacco with added sensorial elements. There is a consumer segment in Japan looking for such an experience, and we believe this will be the best hybrid product available in the market. I want now to emphasize the deep alignment of our business with sustainability and ESG objectives, which sit at the core of our mission and strategy. Our most important ESG issue is the health impact of our products. By innovating with significantly better alternatives, such as IQOS, we have a historic opportunity to substantially reduce this impact by switching adult smokers, who would otherwise continue to smoke, to reduced risk products. Through deploying RRPs at scale we can improve public health and contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals, especially Goal 3 Good Health & Well-Being. We also have best-in-class practices across a range of central ESG issues, where the other three of our four sustainability pillars are focused. We believe this provides a unique combination, whereby sustainability is a true driver of innovation and growth. By embedding sustainability into the core of our business, we can create value for our shareholders, and society at large. To conclude, our Q3 results were stronger than expected, and we have raised our full-year guidance to reflect around plus 5% to plus 6% organic EPS growth. We are building a business through RRPs to deliver superior and sustainable growth over the coming years. The continued momentum of IQOS through the challenges of the pandemic demonstrates these structural growth characteristics. We are also committed to maintaining the competitiveness of our combustible business. We have a number of levers for growth in our top and bottom lines. First, the powerful mix effect of RRPs. Second, pricing, which will remain important for combustibles and, where appropriate, for RRPs. Additionally, efficiencies in our manufacturing and SG&A costs are further levers as we continue to hone our business model. Moreover, with the launches of the IQOS VEEV and lil products, we are broadening and stepping up our product offer and innovation in 2021. You can also expect us to bring further exciting innovation to our IQOS heat-not-burn platform. As I just mentioned, sustainability and ESG are at the heart of our smoke-free strategy and we continue to work tirelessly to further our mission. As we all know, there remains continued uncertainty regarding the pandemic, the impact of social restrictions and their economic aftermath. However, when COVID-related headwinds abate we expect to resume growth consistent with the currency-neutral compound annual growth rates in our 2019-2021 algorithm of at least 5% net revenue growth and at least 8% adjusted diluted EPS growth on an organic basis. In short, we look forward with confidence and we will expand on these topics further at our next Investor Day, which we plan to hold in early 2021. Thank you. I am now more than happy to answer your questions. Thanks, Adam. We definitely are repeating our ambition to reach next year 20 -- 200 billion stick in the heat-not-burn category, and I think that the growth that we deliver quarter-after-quarter is clearly pointing to that direction. Then you are alluding to the 2025 objective of 250 billion plus, which is I think here aligned with what I've started to detail on the presentation, which is really the fact that we are broadening the portfolio when it comes to RRPs product, and we are going to of course come with more enrichment, more segmentation, more offering when it comes to heat-not-burn. We are entering the evaping category, and all that is going to put us on the track to deliver that ambition. And I think everything I've been seeing in term of segmentation of the devices now that we are coming with the lil offering, what we have started to do now in Japan, in Russia, when it comes to the consumables, it shows that clearly now the market is getting a bit more mature, of course, it's still at an early stage in most places, but in a few places we have some first element of a bigger market, it is time now to enrich the offering and broaden the spectrum of what we can offer to, I would say, concur and convince more smoker to switch to our product, and therefore that is what is going to put us on the right track for this ambition for 2025. Yes, I don't think that there is anything to be read there. I think that we are very happy with the performance on the key market. Of course, you know what has been and depending on the season and the consumption pattern and what has been happening on the borders, we know that some borders were closed. We talked about illicit trade being stopped, I mean, that can be disruptors to the evolution if you take a kind of flash or split quarter view. But I would say the trend that we are seeing in Q3, we are very much in line with a nice strong trend that we've been observing over the first part of the year over H1. So, I don't think that there is anything in Q3 that would be signaling a slowdown in the way we are gaining share in an underlying manner. Well, thanks for the question. Obviously, it's very early stage to start talking about next year. I think you very rightly said it, 2021 is full of uncertainty and we even recognized that the last months of 2020 has a fair share of uncertainty as well. So, difficult to of course start to elaborate on 2021. The only thing I can say at this stage is that we are going to enter 2021 with the strength of our RRP business that is clear from this first nine months performance. There will be certainly a number of low comps in the basis of 2020, but as we don't know how the markets are going to be in 2021, and if I take the example of duty-free, which of course you could say we're going to have nine months with very, very low business in duty-free in 2020. So, one could argue well that's an easy basis of comparison, but nobody is able to say today what's going to be the rebound next year of duty-free. So, it's just difficult to say which kind of growth trajectory at that stage it designs if you want. I hope we'll know more at the beginning of 2021, when we will comment on our full-year 2020, and at that stage we can share more details with you, but I think that for us, the main element today that I would say is a kind of for sure whatever is the environment, it is a very, very strong performance of our heat-not-burn business. Sure, happy to do that. Well, the margin improvement is and that's probably the strength of the performance is not coming from one element. I think it's a collection of drivers that we have to add to the topline evolution, nice margin evolution. And that is coming first, of course, from the growth of RRPs, and I think we are showing this quarter's impact on the gross margin of the positive impact on the mix of the consumable in heat-not-burn. And as we keep growing the business that is of course a nice mix positive impact, clearly helping the margin. There is also everything we are doing on price and we keep clearly working in the direction of improving nicely price on combustible. There is -- and I would be happy to elaborate further if you want. Then there is, of course, everything we do on manufacturing productivity, which is also a nice driver, and then below the gross profit, you're right, we have this very positive evolution of our SG&A, where we managed to decrease on an organic basis SG&A by about 7% when the decrease of the topline is only 1.5%. So, we have a nice leverage if you want between the two. And here you have a mix of things. First of all, yes, of course, we are working on the efficiency of our -- all functions, all teams are working on working in a simpler, more efficient, more digitized manner. We are platforming our work. We are standardizing, we are automating, we are using digital in all capacity in order to work in a more efficient manner. So that is contributing to certainly some saving. Then on top of all this effort, you're absolutely right. We have increased efficiency as we turn toward a more digital commercial engine on RRPs. And that is of course something that is going to accompany us on the long term. We build at the origin the IQOS business with a business model you know with a lot of physical cultures and based on having some retail places that we were owning and that was great to start. We needed to do that, but of course, as we are growing the market, as we are learning about it and as we are developing our digital skills, we are indeed developing a tool, which is really efficient both in term of digital customer experience and in term of digital trade experience and that is allowing us to be much more efficient in contacting smoker that we can convince to switch to IQOS in explaining and accompanying them on answering all their question and coaching them in a digital manner for them to understand how it works, how it is a global experience. To answer that question, we have been creating communities where people switching to IQOS can exchange their impressions and their tips. And then once it is done, of course, the job is not done and we are moving to retention and really build this intimacy through having a lot of data about our customer of IQOS and really being able to bring them the best overall experience and keep them as customer of our heat-not-burn business. So that's what we are doing today and absolutely that is translating into reduced cost of acquisition and reduced cost of retention. We are certainly not at the end of this improvement, but that is nicely helping the performance in 2020 for sure. Well, I think it's -- each market Michael is different. So the answer probably could require long explanation and entering the various type of dynamic. And starting with the regulation, of course, the capacity that we have to speak about IQOS and explain how it works. In some market we have this capacity to explain to smoker that a better alternative does exist in other country, we are much more limited. So that is clearly having an impact. Then certainly there is an impact as you grow the visibility of IQOS, as you people starting to see friends, family around them using IQOS, you may have a kind of snowball effect maybe it's a little bit of a caricature, but I think to some extent it can play like that and that can accelerate the evolution of the market. You have also the cultural dimension, which is quite important, in some country people will be proud of having discovered IQOS and they will want to share that with their friends and they will become our best salespeople I would say about IQOS and taking themselves the time to explain and convince friends and relatives. In other culture, it would be very different and that won't happen because they will believe that it's a personal choice and they don't want to interfere on that. So, all that to explain the very different pattern that we are seeing in terms of development of the business. Having said that, you're absolutely right. The more we're going to be able to go digital and have great digital tool to contact smokers talk about IQOS be able to engage them in what is the IQOS experience. The more we are going to be able to grow the market and clearly developing the digital customer experience is going to be key hopefully in accelerating the growth in several market. But let's not underestimate the fact that regulation can be a pretty significant restriction nevertheless even when it comes to using digital tools. So again that explain why I think there is certainly no market where we are not seeing that we have the ambition to make them RRP market, but certainly in some market it's going to take a bit more time. Sure, Michael. What I can share with you is that, so you remember that menthol was roughly speaking 10% of the EU market altogether. I think the vast majority of the menthol smokers have been switching to other type of combustible cigarettes. And so I don't think that there has been certainly not maybe what was all in term of people stopping to smoke. It's probably a few percent, but no more than that. And when it comes to switching to other alternative like heat-not-burn and IQOS in particular maybe around 5% of the people have done that so far. It doesn't mean that we are giving up. We think that we can certainly convince more people, but I think the impact has been relatively limited. You're right; probably helping a little bit in Poland. Maybe in the UK as well which two big market for menthol. But I would not say that it has been having a big, big positive impact so far on our IQOS business. Well, I understand the question, but at that stage you know I think we are not going to enter into more granularity. I think we are giving through this set of numbers and presentation more detail on the driver for profitability. So I'm sure that you are able to capture through the gross margin evolution and other element that we are giving some elements. But it's obviously, as you can imagine, a relatively strategic information sensitive and therefore it's not something that we can share, but I'm certainly happy to confirm that we are seeing a significant decrease and that we have ambition for more significant decrease in the future. So I'm just reiterating my comment that you should expect more improvement on the ramping up of the profitability of our RRP business in the future, which is really great because we are combining a big, big driver for the top line growth quite obviously and in addition, a nice driver for profitability improvement. Well, as you know, globally we have a position because it deserves it. Our RRP business as a premium business. It's a unique consumer experience and that fully justify a premium price positioning. Now, of course, as you know in some country as well, the excise duty level is lower, sometime materially lower on RRPs and heat-not-burn then on combustible cigarettes. And therefore that is also justifying a lower price point. So, I would say, as a rule we have our combustible that are priced at the price on Marlboro or sometimes even a bit below Marlboro and I think it's a good positioning. The sweet spot to really reflect the overall experience and the value for the consumer, but also the specificity of the heat-not-burn category and heat-not-burn products. And in segmentation, we are going to do the same. It's of course related to the customer expense as well and all three consumable are under the same and not deliver the same experience. And exactly like we have been doing for decades on consumable depending on the level of, I would say, benefit value for the consumer. We know what is perceiving the overall pleasure and positive dimension for him. We'll have different price positioning that will be aligned with that. I don't think we should expect anything really materially different there. Hi, Bonnie. Thanks for the question, Bonnie. We haven't changed our mind at that stage on the buyback and we've announced as you know 2.6% increase of the dividend to $4.80 a year. So we continue to reward the shareholders. And I think we stated in the past and we are very much on that line that we would not start to share buyback that could potentially endanger the rating. And I'm not sure that today we have a huge flexibility on that rating with the balance sheet that we have today. So we have a very strong balance sheet and we want to keep that. I don't think that we would love to be losing some nudging the rating because of buyback. So I'm not closing the door on the long term of course it's a moving situation. And as we keep generating cash and strengthening the balance sheet, we may together with the Board decide to change that, but for the time being, this is not on the agenda. Thanks Bonnie for not asking for a guidance because we will not give you anyway. Trying to elaborate on tailwind and headwinds. I think the tailwinds are quite obvious. We have this RRP business that is you know almost one-fourth of the business. So it's very material in term of share of revenue, that is going very strongly. We talk about growth of about 28%, 29% year-to-date. We see a number of market that are actually contributing to the dynamism. We are, as we said, enriching the offers. So we see that we start to enter into new phase of this ambition of creating this category that we think one day will be, I would say, putting an end to a smoking world by this segmentation enrichment of the offer. So we have here a very powerful tailwind that is going to help us as we enter into 2021. And as you have seen, it's not only, as I said positive for the top line, but it also nicely positive for the bottom line, because we are ramping up the profitability on that business and that is a business that has the potential to be super nicely profitable. Then of course you know I said it you have all these very low comps that we're going to have in few markets. We have this Q2 that has been very difficult. You have the duty-free business that is extremely depressed. So one could argue that if things were to start gradually in 2021 to be back to normal, but that could provide easy comp for growth. Now that unfortunately the segue for headwinds, because we don't know what's going to be the environment. More and more people are saying that we're not going to be back to normal maybe until the summer of 2021. Nobody knows what exactly it means, by the way, but people are saying, when the vaccine will be available, which could be summer 2021. That's a condition to be back to some more normality and therefore we don't know how it's going to play out globally on the business. But I think we are taking comfort and confidence from the fact that I mean the 2020 will not have been a walk in the park, that for sure, and despite that, we are delivering what I consider to be a robust performance and targeting our nice organic growth for the adjusted EPS. So it shows that even in a difficult environment, we managed to deliver a nice performance. Sure, Gaurav. So, no, this is not the new normal for the company. We are obviously going through stormy water. So it's an adjustment and there is number of project by the way that given the environment we prefer to postpone, so that explain why we are now targeting $0.6 billion for the year. I think you can expect us when we are back to a more normal environment, to be back to a more normal CapEx amount that I would say probably to be around $0.8 billion. So that could stay below the level. You're right of amortization and depreciation that is north of $900 million today. And of course overtime if it continues like that, that will mean that this amount will decrease as well. You're absolutely right. I'm not able to give you a phasing for that, but that should be over time a natural evolution though of course with the carryover effect it will take some time. I think at the end of September, we have been taking care of the potential impact of that. So I would not expect anything major for the rest of the year. Thank you. Hi, Chris. No, Chris. I think that you're right. And I think we flagged in H1 that there was a number of country with some anticipation on inventory. We got the reversal of that in Q3. You're right. If you retreat the shipment by that, we have a record around 20.5 billion stick of in-market sales which is, I mean, it's quite a symbolic threshold, but to be above $20 billion is quite nice, and we believe that we are globally at the right level at the end of September. So we're not expecting today in Q4 any material impact on inventory for heat-not-burn. So there could be very limited number of market launch in Q4. I think we're taking the time to have all the lesson learned from what we've seen in New Zealand to make sure that when we launch, we are super ready and very successful. There is certainly things around age verification on which we are still working and which are very important for us as you know. So we are still working on these various dimension. So don't expect too much in Q4. I think the big new launches will be more for 2021. Thank you. Owen, hi. Sure. And so we haven't been splitting the $250 billion. So I won't do it now. I think we believe that quite obviously each RRP category has a play in getting there, but there is no doubt that we continue to see the heat-not-burn category as being I would say the majority of this $250 billion. So we certainly intend to develop e-vaping and IQOS VEEV and other things that we could launch from now until 2025. But I think you should expect still a big part of this -- a big majority of the $250 billion to come from heat-not-burn. Remember I mean this is an aspiration that we've been sharing. I think as we progress we'll make sure that we put more detail around that. So bear with us. We're going to certainly continue to give more vision, more visibility. But at this stage I cannot split further the $250 billion and quite obviously we want to develop things in a profitable manner. So that also drives the choices and the final number in the split of the $250 billion. Well, I don't have that with me, but I can see with the team maybe as to whether there is something that we can find the one for you. Thank you. Thank you all. Talk to you soon. Bye."

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.\nNick Rolli: Welcome and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2020 second quarter results. You may access the release on www.pmi.com or the PMI Investor Relations app. A glossary of terms, including the definition for reduced-risk products or RRPs as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures, and additional heated tobacco unit market data are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Unless otherwise stated all references to IQOS, are to our IQOS heat-not-burn products. In addition, please note our estimates for total industry and market share for the quarter are subject to limitations on the availability and accuracy of industry data in certain geographies during pandemic-related restrictions. Comparisons presented on a like-for-like basis reflect pro forma 2019 results, which have been adjusted for the deconsolidation of our Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc., effective March 22, 2019. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. Please also note the additional forward-looking and cautionary statements related to COVID-19. It's now my pleasure to introduce Emmanuel Babeau, our Chief Financial Officer. Emmanuel?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Nick and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I hope everyone listening to the call and those close to you are safe and well. Our main focus remains the health and well-being of our employees, their families, and the communities in which we operate. During restrictions, we have implemented stringent policy and measures to minimize risk for those who continue to work in our facilities and offices. For all our employees, including those working from home, providing guidance and support is also essential. We are now facilitating a gradual, carefully managed return to the workplace in some location, where local condition and authorities restrictions allow. The strength and spirit shown in this challenging time by the people that make up our organization continues to be a real inspiration to me and the PMI management team, and I'd like to take this opportunity to thank them for their outstanding efforts. I now turn to the business, which delivered a robust performance in the first half of the year despite the unprecedented circumstances of the pandemic. Most importantly, the continued momentum of IQOS was excellent with an estimated 15.4 million users at the end of the second quarter. Our commercial model pivoted rapidly to digital and remote engagements, while preserving high rates of IQOS' user acquisition and brand retention. With volumes of heated tobacco units growing 24% in Q2 2020 compared to the prior year, RRPs made up almost one quarter of our net revenues. In addition, after two very difficult months in the quarter due to the pandemic, our combustible business is now improving. Industry volumes started to recover in June and the beginning of July, reflecting the gradual easing of confinement in many countries. The improvement was particularly driven by the EU, our largest region in term of net revenue and adjusted operating income. The main enduring headwinds linked to COVID-related restrictions are the absence of recovery in duty-free; and in Indonesia, where this is compounded by pricing dynamics. Economic uncertainty remains and we all hope for no major resurgence of the pandemic. Notably, despite additional COVID-related expenses, our operating margin has been strong in both the second quarter and first half. This reflects the increasing mix of RRPs in our business and their improving profitability. Productivity savings in manufacturing across RRPs and combustible, SG&A savings from the pivot to digital, the elimination of -- or postponement of certain lower priority projects and the operating leverage of higher RRP volumes all contributed. Indeed, it is no coincidence that the three regions where RRPs have a strong presence are driving this margin performance. We reached a truly historic milestone for IQOS, our mission and our future growth prospect on July 7 with the FDA's authorization of IQOS as a modified risk tobacco product. IQOS is the first electronic nicotine product to receive an MRTP order. Following a review of our extensive scientific evidence package, the agency found that an exposure modification order for IQOS is appropriate to promote the public health in the United States, demonstrating that IQOS is fundamentally different product from combustible cigarette and a better choice for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke. The agency concluded that issuing the order for IQOS is expected to benefit the health of the population as a whole taking into account both user of tobacco product and person who do not currently use tobacco product. A critical enabler for the future growth of RRPs is the implementation of differentiated regulatory framework that can help encourage adults who would otherwise continue to smoke to instead switch to better alternatives, in line with the harm reduction principle. The authorization allows a version of IQOS to be marketed with information confirming the validity of our scientific studies with regard to the significant reduction of exposure to the harmful and potentially harmful chemicals contained in cigarette smoke. The FDA decision and subsequent comprehensive post-market controls and monitoring, focusing on use prevention provide an important example of how government and public health organization around the world can implement an inclusive, science-based approach to help rapidly shift adult smokers who would otherwise continue smoking to better options while simultaneously guarding against unintended consequences. With investors increasingly focused on environmental, social, and governance aspect, I would like to highlight our recently published Integrated Report for 2019. The report covers a variety of important ESG topics and measures, including our business transformation metrics. Notably, our expanded aspirational targets now include new goals for the number of users of our smoke-free product in non-OECD countries and youth access prevention. The report is available on our website at pmi.com. Let's turn now to our strong performance over the first half of the year. This was clearly a very challenging period with disruption to many aspects of our operations, including our supply chain and route-to-market. I am proud to say that our organization has the strength and agility to withstand this with limited impact on supply to our consumer and trade partners. Despite these unprecedented headwinds across many of our key markets, our currency-neutral net revenues helped by a strong first quarter were close to flat versus the prior year on a like-for-like basis. Driven by pricing in combustible, manufacturing and SG&A efficiency and the dual RRP margin effect of growing weight and improving profitability, our adjusted operating income margin increased over 200 basis points to deliver 8% adjusted diluted EPS growth, all on the like-for-like ex-currency basis. I focus now on our second quarter performance. The effect of confinement on mobility impacted daily consumption pattern in certain markets, including those of daily income workers in developing countries and disrupted the retail trade. This led to significant industry volume decline in a number of geographies during April and May, which primarily impacted our combustible business. As expected, duty-free sales were weak. The March build-up of trade and distributor inventory largely reversed in the first part of the quarter, and we had to delay a few pricing decisions. This period also coincided with a challenging prior year comparison. Notwithstanding these challenges, our performance was better than we expected when we last updated our guidance on June 11.  Currency-neutral net revenue declined 9.5% compared to our assumption of around the high end of minus 8% to minus 12%. Given this net revenue decline and the strong prior year profitability, we were pleased to maintain a stable adjusted operating income margin. This was supported by growth in the net revenues and profitability of RRPs and cost efficiencies. Combustible pricing of 3.3% also contributed and reflect robust pricing in many markets, partly offset by Indonesia and a strong prior year comparison in Turkey. Reported diluted EPS of $1.25 was notably better than the upper end of our previous guidance range, including a lower currency impact of $0.06. Our adjusted diluted EPS was $1.29, excluding reporting adjustment for asset impairment and exit cost, which represents an ex-currency decline of 7.5% compared to the prior year. There were three main drivers of this better-than-anticipated performance. First, the recovery of industry volume in June, notably in the higher-margin EU region, benefited our net revenues and margin. Second, IQOS user acquisition grew substantially in the same month with markets such as Russia back to pre-COVID rate and overall IQOS acquisition for the quarter only 35% below pre-pandemic levels. Last, we had the benefit of certain non-underlying factors. These include trade inventory movement in June ahead of tax and regulatory changes in Germany, Russia and Saudi Arabia, cost phasing, and a lower tax charge, largely driven by a reduced corporate income tax rate in Indonesia, as well as changes in our earnings mix. These data [ph] factors accounted for approximately $0.10 of the better EPS performance. Before we come to guidance, I will outline some of the dynamics for the second half of the year. We expect a gradual underlying improvement in the combustible business coupled with continued robust growth for IQOS. The pandemic continues to present an uncertain operating environment with a potential for tightened restriction in localized areas. While not included in our guidance assumption, there also remain a non-negligible risk of a resurgence in the virus and the return of national lockdowns. The full economic fallout of the various restriction is also unclear. This said, we observe relative stability in term of pandemic restriction and improving visibility across a number of geographies in recent weeks. Conversely, visibility remains lower in some areas such as Indonesia and Latin America, in addition to the absence of any recovery so far in Duty Free, which as a reminder represented close to 4% of our net revenues in 2019. In term of our cigarette business, while underlying industry volumes are gradually improving as restrictions ease, we assume that the return to a normal level of consumption occasion for consumer will take time. We do not assume significant widespread increase in down-trading with such dynamic currently concentrated in markets were a trend already existed due to elevated price gaps. It is reasonable to expect some delays in the timing of pricing in certain markets due to the pandemic situation. In RRPs, sales of devices and HTUs are performing strongly, reflecting the better-than- expected IQOS user acquisition and continued strong brand retention and conversion. Our unique commercial model has demonstrated the flexibility to accelerate the shift to digital and remote activity and we continue with high level of such engagement in markets where stores are reopened. Despite the exceptional headwinds of 2020, we expect to grow our full year adjusted diluted EPS between plus 2% and plus 5% on the currency-neutral like-for-like basis. This corresponds to an adjusted diluted EPS range of $4.92 to $5.07, including an estimated unfavorable currency impact at prevailing exchange rate of $0.31. This forecast assumes a total industry decline of 7% to 9%, excluding the U.S. and China, and a decline in total PMI shipment volume of 8% to 10% on the like-for-like basis due notably to Duty Free and Indonesia. With regard to net revenue, in like-for-like ex-currency term, we assume low-single digit growth, excluding Duty Free and Indonesia. Due to these two factors, our overall net revenue may see a modest decline. The forecast also reflect expansion in our ex-currency like-for-like adjusted operating income margin of more than 150 basis points. We expect the full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23%, 2020 operating cash flow of at least $9 billion and $0.7 billion of capital expenditures. All these estimates assume that national lockdowns will not recur in our key international markets in the remainder of the year. Specifically for the second half, while underlying trends should gradually improve, we expect the recovery in our growth to be skewed towards the fourth quarter. This assumes the progressive easing of restrictions across the remaining markets with commensurate greater industry recovery towards the end of the year and the compound effect of increased sequential IQOS user acquisition. In the third quarter, we expect the reversal of certain one-time benefit from the first half, with an EPS impact of approximately $0.10 and a net revenue impact of around 1%. The continuation of headwinds in Duty Free and Indonesia, the timing of 2020 pricing in certain markets and the phasing in of costs are also included in our assumptions. We expect to see a good sequential improvement in reported net revenues in the third quarter, but a decline compared to the challenging prior year comparison. For adjusted EPS, also due to the timing of certain SG&A cost and the one-off item of the first half, we expect Q3 2020 to be broadly in line with Q2 2020. Sequential improvement in reported net revenue should continue in the fourth quarter although likely still in slightly negative territory compared to 2019. Growth in adjusted EPS will also be driven by a greater expected realization of cost efficiency from new initiatives. I will now cover our second quarter performance in more detail. As expected, our shipment volumes were weak, driven by the effect of marked industry declines on our combustible volume due to pandemic-related lockdown measures. Notable market contributors to this decline were Indonesia, Mexico and the Philippines, all of which were impacted by restrictions, loss of income for daily wage workers, and significant price increases. Conversely, our HTU shipment volumes continued to grow strongly to reach a record 18.7 billion units, driven by the EU region, Japan, and Russia. While overall volume in the quarter was weak, the sequential recovery seen in June and the beginning of July is more encouraging. Our combined June in-market sales volume was the highest monthly total this year and grew 2.8% compared to June 2019. Though this growth includes an estimated 3 billion unit effect from inventory movements, it mainly reflect better industry dynamics across many geographies, notably the EU region, which declined by 7.3% in Q2 overall, but grew in June. We are also encouraged by the sequential improvement in HTU volumes, which exhibited positive year-on-year growth throughout the quarter. This strong performance from IQOS mean that heated tobacco units made up over 10% of our total shipment volume in the first half of the year as compared to approximately 8% in 2019 and 5% in 2018. While somewhat flattened in Q2 2020 by weaker combustible volume, we expect this proportion to grow over time as our positive momentum on RRPs continues. RRP net revenues reached $3.2 billion in the first half, reaching almost one quarter of PMI's total net revenue in Q2. IQOS devices accounted for approximately 8% of RRP net revenue in the second quarter due to a lower ratio of new user to existing user, given pandemic effect, longer replacement cycle and geographic mix, as in some countries, we still sell a substantial amount of the lower priced IQOS 2.4 Plus device. Turning now to market share. Our total international share declined by 0.1 point to 28% in the second quarter with higher share for heated tobacco units, which increased by 0.9 points to reach 3%, offset by lower share for cigarettes. Our market share was negatively impacted by Indonesia and the market mix effect of Duty Free, where volumes dropped sharply and our share is typically much higher than our overall international share. The cannibalization effect of out-switching to IQOS were essentially offset by positive impact elsewhere, and in markets where IQOS has a meaningful presence, our share increased with almost no exceptions. It follows that our combined market share increased notably in the EU region, Japan, and Russia. It's also true that in many markets Marlboro over-indexes to social consumption occasions, which were naturally lower during COVID-related confinements. We expect Marlboro share to recover as restrictions ease. Indonesia cigarette market saw an accumulation of headwinds in the second quarter. A pronounced impact from pandemic-related restriction on daily consumption added to the effect of tax-driven pricing and retail disruption. Industry volumes declined by 22%, excluding trade inventory movement whereas our shipments declined 28%. Our share decline can be attributed to three broad dynamics. First, within the Tier 1 segment, price gaps remain elevated, given our price leadership of the past 18 months and the delay in the enforcement of the minimum retail price. Combined with COVID effect, this has contributed to the end of performance of our premium-skewed portfolio despite better sequential performance from A Mild. The process of minimum selling price enforcement has started. Government inspectors have returned to the field. However, the full enforcement and subsequent trade flow-through of compliant product may not be complete until the fourth quarter. Second is the strong growth of the tax-advantaged below Tier 1 segment, which in conjunction with the tax-driven pricing and pandemic situation of 2020, has led to increased down-trading. This was designed for small players with production below a certain volume threshold. However, the segment is not operating within the spirit and intent of the law. With the segments now at approximately 25% of the market, this represents a serious threat to government excise revenue and the correction of volume-based tax tiers become urgent. Third, the stricter public mobility restriction in urban areas, where our share is higher, has disproportionately impacted our portfolio. However, our market share sequentially improved in June, supported by strength of our brands. While we see sign of improvement in the market, the situation remains challenging. We now assume the total industry decline will be approximately 15% for the full year, reflecting progressive sequential improvement in daily consumption from the particularly weak second quarter. We are fully committed to improving our performance in this key market. We have a number of ongoing commercial initiatives to leverage equity of our brand portfolio through the remainder of the year. This includes the introduction of new variants in the growing SKT and full-flavor SKM segments such as the Dji Sam Soe 12 launched in March and Marlboro Filter Black 16 launched this month. However, with enforcement of the minimum retail price now underway, the main outstanding structural issue is the volume-tiered tax system, which clearly advantages growth of the super-low segment. In the status quo, this will have a significant impact on government excise revenue this year. We concur with the public policy expert and economist that urge the government to create more predictability and a level playing field by reforming the multi-tier excise tax structure and enforcing the minimum retail selling price without exception across Indonesia. Overall, while short-term challenges remain, the structural headwinds in the market are addressable through government action. The headwinds directly related to the pandemic are likely to be temporary in nature and our brands are strong, giving us a solid platform to rebuild our share. I shift now to our RRP performance. We estimate that there were 15.4 million total IQOS users as of June 30, compared to an estimated 14.6 million last quarter. This represents the addition of around 4 million adult users since the same time last year, a phenomenal achievement given the circumstances. This reflects widespread user growth momentum across all key IQOS geographies, including Japan, the EU region, and Russia. We further estimate that 72% of this total or 11.2 million adult smokers have stopped smoking and switched to IQOS with the balance in various stages of conversion. We observe early indication that the propensity of smoker to switch to RRPs is trending positively since the pandemic began, and we will see how this develops in the coming period. We are also optimistic that the FDA's granting of the modified risk tobacco product order for a version of IQOS will contribute over time to better understanding of the heated tobacco category and the benefit of switching to IQOS compared to continued smoking. The overall share performance of IQOS HTUs continues to see excellent progress. Indeed, in international markets where IQOS has been commercialized, IQOS HTUs were again the third largest brand in the second quarter with 6.3% share, increasing from 4.5% in Q2 2019 on the comparable market footprint. This was achieved despite not having full national distribution in many markets. In the EU region, we added a record number of IQOS users in the second quarter to reach 4.3 million, an impressive performance given the context of the pandemic. This includes strong growth in Italy, the Czech Republic, Poland, and Germany, and in historically slower markets such as the U.K. where HTU volumes increased more than five-fold over the prior year quarter and Spain. National offtake share surpassed 1% in both of these latter markets despite limited disruption -- distribution, sorry. Second quarter share of HEETS reached 3.9% of total industry volume, which was depressed by an estimated 0.2 points, due to consumer pantry loading effect. Sequential share increased by 0.3 point on an adjusted basis, with in-market sales volume 5% higher compared to Q1 2020. I also refer you to the appendix, where we show share for key EU markets and global key cities, which serve as a useful indicator for national share growth potential. IQOS continued its strong performance in Russia with its share up by 3 points to reach 5.9%. On a sequential basis versus the first quarter of 2020, HEETS share decreased by 0.6 points, reflecting a higher combustible market in the quarter due to increased daily consumption in the warmer months and a trade inventory build-up ahead of the July introduction of the track-and-trace system. A more reliable indicator is a sequential in-market sales, which increased by approximately 12% compared to 3% sequential growth in the first quarter. In Japan, our total reported share for heated tobacco units reached 20% in the second quarter, supported by line extension for both Marlboro HeatSticks and HEETS. IQOS user grew to an estimated total of 5.8 million, of which an estimated 4.3 million have stopped smoking and switched to IQOS. On an adjusted total tobacco view, including cigarillos and adjusted for trade inventory movement, the share for our HTU brands increased by 2 points versus the prior year quarter and by 0.7 points sequentially to 18.5%. Q2 2020 adjusted in-market sales volume for our HTU brands grew 4.9% sequentially. This helped drive growth of the overall heated tobacco category to second quarter total tobacco share of over 25%. In addition to strong RRP growth in existing markets, the geographical expansion of IQOS continues. Despite pandemic-related restriction, we leverage our digital capabilities to launch in four new markets; Austria, North Macedonia, Montenegro, and Saudi Arabia. This takes the total number of markets where IQOS is available for sale to 57. Importantly, we still plan to expand our portfolio of smoke-free offering in the second half of the year with the launches of IQOS VEEV in the e-vapor category and of licensed KT&G product in select markets. To conclude on the today's presentation, our growth prospects remain strong. The continued momentum of IQOS through the unprecedented circumstances of the COVID pandemic demonstrates the structural growth characteristic of RRPs and we are on track to reach our 2021 target of 90 billion to 100 billion shipments of heated tobacco units. RRPs now make up almost 25% of our net revenue and we expect this percentage to grow over time. With digital efficiency, operating leverage from scale effect, and productivity saving simultaneously driving up the profitability of RRPs, this is a very positive dynamic for our margin outlook. The historic milestone of modified risk tobacco product authorization for IQOS is a further testament to the integrity of the product and brand proposition and underlying the need for government to implement science-based regulation. In addition, after a difficult April and May, the industry recovery has now started, providing better visibility for the rest of the year. It is also now clear that the effect of the pandemic on the Duty Free business and the specific dynamic in Indonesia will persist for at least another quarter. These factors are reflected in our expectation of sequential improvement through the second half of 2020. We assume the global economic backdrop is likely to affect total cigarette volume and induce some down-trading in certain markets. This is a dynamic we have faced before in a variety of markets where we have demonstrated robust business performance. As a reminder, we expect the unprecedented declines in Q2 2020 to reverse next year easing comparison. We also remain committed to increasing our market share through the growth of RRPs and by maintaining our leadership position in combustible. This is supported by a continued sharp focus on costs. We remain on track to deliver our target of over $1 billion in efficiency by 2021 through both manufacturing productivity and SG&A savings. We have additional opportunities on top of this from changes in our post-pandemic way of working, including the acceleration of digital activities. Importantly, our balance sheet and financial position are strong and our commitment to the dividend remains unwavering. Last, when COVID-related headwinds abate, we expect to resume growth consistent with the currency-neutral compound annual growth rate in our 2019-2021 algorithm of at least 5% net revenue growth and at least 8% adjusted diluted EPS growth. Thank you. I am now happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.\nChris Growe: Hi, good morning and nice to hear from you, Emmanuel.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Good morning.\nChris Growe: I like to -- good morning, I like to commend you for giving guidance for the year. I know there's uncertainty, but we certainly appreciate your outlook even amidst the uncertainties in the market today. So, thank you for that. I had a question if I could first of all on the -- on IQOS performance. Obviously, it was very strong in the quarter. I'd like to understand how you approached your IQOS investment. Did you pull back on that in the second quarter? Obviously, some of the stores were closed, and did you restart that in June in the third quarter? Just to understand kind of the momentum behind that product line as we move into the second half of the year.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes. Sure, Chris. Well, of course, IQOS remains our our top priority and we are focusing our efforts and investments behind IQOS. So, even in this challenging environment, we kept investing behind IQOS. Of course, we had to take into account the evolution of the environment and there was a number of investments that had to be postponed because they were no longer making sense. So, it was not possible to adjust and do them. There were a number of things on the commercial model that we had to revisit, and notably, when they were involving face-to-face contact. There were launches of new product that we were working on that we had to delay. So, there were clearly versus initial plan some reduction in the investment, but we absolutely stayed committed to keep increasing investment behind IQOS. I would say for me, the good thing of this Q2 and the H1 as a whole is that we see that the investments are getting an increasing return as we are, first, on that, what I would call the fixed part of the investment, the structure that we have to invest behind our RRPs and IQOS, we are growing volume. So, we amortized this investment over a larger volume and sales. So, we decreased the first, fixed cost, if you want, and we increased profitability through that. And there is also a variable part on the investment in term of consumer acquisition or retention, and here I would say through the crisis, we are of course already working on that. Wecertainly have been accelerating the usage of digital customer experience and way to engage with them in a more efficient, more digital manner, and that is going to be more scalable, that is going to reduce this variable cost per user, which is also very good news for the future of IQOS and IQOS profitability.\nChris Growe: Thank you for that, and I have just one follow-up question if I could. And in relation to pricing, which was a little stronger than I had expected in the quarter, which was great. I'm just curious, you talked about maybe delaying some pricing decisions. Are those just a delay? Have you had a pull back on pricing decisions as you've seen some down-trading in some markets? I'm just curious how that -- how you approach the pricing dynamic there?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes. Well, of course, we have to take into account the environment when it comes to price increase. It is clear that in markets that are severely disrupted, where the trade is disrupted, where there is some very challenging evolution in some places because of the lockdown, we have to revisit plan for increasing price. So, it is clear that we take that into account. It doesn't change the potential of price increase that we absolutely retain and that once the COVID has passed, we will continue to implement. But clearly, in this environment, we are seeing that we were planning in a normal environment that are neither, I would say, desirable nor doable in the current environment, and that could include some delay and I think we are flagging that for Q3, where there was last year a number of price increase; and this year, I think it could be more skewed towards Q4 when things are normalizing hopefully.\nChris Growe: Okay. Thanks so much for your time.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gaurav Jain of Barclays.\nGaurav Jain: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot. I have three questions. Number one is that in EU, you are talking of an acceleration in June, particularly in IQOS, and we know that there was a menthol cigarette ban in May. So, was there any benefit that IQOS saw, because it is still available in flavors, especially you are highlighting Poland, which is a big menthol market? So, I was just curious on that.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes, thanks for the question. So, you're absolutely right. As you all know the menthol ban came into force on the 20th of May. And really, that means that it has played over the month of June. I think it's premature to say that we have benefited from that. As you know, we have an under-exposure to the category. So, that is probably a positive evolution for us in terms of evolution of the market. I would not say that the IQOS evolution is obviously impacted by that. I cannot exclude that it has been helping a little bit, but I would say IQOS in the EU behaved well through the quarter; once again underlines the strength of IQOS in the EU through this second quarter. And I would expect probably Q3 to bring more answer on the impact of the menthol ban both on IQOS possibly and on the impact on the rest of the CC category.\nGaurav Jain: Sure. My second question is on your guidance, and your assumption is that there are no further national lockdowns during the remainder of 2020. I appreciate you are not commenting on 2021, but if we were to assume that that's the case in 2021 as well, then Q2 '20 will create a very favorable comp because you had national lockdowns in Q2 '20 and most likely there won't be. So, could there be a year in 2021 when volumes are flattish for you?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Well, if you allow me, I'm not going to enter now into the comment of 2021, we'll do that in due course. But I can like you come to the pure look at the fact that indeed we have a depressed Q2. We have a market Duty Free that is very severely impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, and if things were back to normal next year, that would globally mean a favorable basis of comparison. But at this stage, I will keep with this simple fact-based possibility, if this was a scenario being confirmed, and in due course, of course, we'll share with you what it could mean for our '21 outlook, but it's too early to comment.\nGaurav Jain: Sure. Thank you. And my last question is on your travel retail business. Can you talk a bit more in detail as to what exactly it is? Because we know travel retail is not big in U.S. and you're not there in China. So it does seem that a lot of it is probably within EU travel. So, is that what we should focus on that what are the travel dynamics within EU to be able to forecast what's happening in your travel retail business?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Well, EU is certainly important, but I think we have a global exposure. You're right, we're not in the U.S., we're not in China, but it doesn't mean that we're not benefiting from U.S. and Chinese travelers when they're traveling to other airport. So, EU, I would say, area is important, but our exposure is much, much broader than that, and therefore, it cannot be summarized to European exposure if you want.\nGaurav Jain: Sure. But what I was curious is that is it like 50% of your businesses is intra-EU travel or 30% or 40%, is there any way to quantify it?\nEmmanuel Babeau: No. Well, I don't think we give that split, but I can tell you that this would be 12% [ph], if I was to characterize it.\nGaurav Jain: Okay, brilliant. Thanks a lot.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: Thank you. Hello. I wanted to circle back on the new user acquisition and just hoping you could give us an update on the progress you've made on the digital front in terms of some of the virtual guided trials you mentioned and really how that's impacting consumer engagement? And then, I'd be curious to hear what percent of your new users are coming from digital at this point?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thanks, Bonnie for the question. Of course, we can share what we can share both by the way for confidentiality reason because it's part of the recipe of the success and as we gather the information, clearly, we've been accelerating on engaging with our customers through digital. So the initial model, as you know, was first -- not only, but first center around personnel contact through shops, through coaches and engaging into explaining to smokers the benefit of switching to IQOS. Truth, it has started, we did not discover that with the COVID crisis. But, of course, in front of market that where lockdown and people confine at home, we had to accelerate the plan on digital engagement and to develop all the tools through all the digital contacts and people were, of course, at home using a lot Internet to develop full interaction and full capacity to contact first, explain, follow and, of course, using a totally remote experience for our consumer. So, I'm not able to give you and I'm not sure that we would like to share that because it's quite sensitive, but I can tell you that we see the percentage of IQOS and fully managed customer through digital, which is increasing very fast and becoming very important. And, of course, the beauty of that is that it is easily scalable at a cheaper cost, which was probably more difficult when it was a full human-related experience. And again, I think that this H1 2020 will remain a landmark for our IQOS business for a number of reason; the MRTP decision is one; the improvement on profitability on the RRP business is another one; but, certainly, the acceleration of our digital model on acquisition and on retention for our IQOS customer is another one.\nBonnie Herzog: That's really helpful color. And I think it's pretty impressive just thinking through how this has really accelerated your efforts potentially in just your learning. So, as I think about what you were able to do in the quarter and during this environment in terms of acquiring more new users than you originally expected, does it suggest that your quarterly new user rate, which has been about 1 million new users each quarter in the last several quarters, do you think that this could step up as the world starts to reopen? In other words, have you learned something new in terms of strategy to accelerate the conversion?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Well, I would not go as far as to say that we are now at that stage coming with a vision that is going to accelerate things. But it is, certainly, confirming that our ambition is absolutely legitimate. We are confirming the 90 billion to 100 billion stick next year, and this is going to come from the continuation of a very strong acquisition of new IQOS users. No doubt that this digital play is going to help us achieving that goal, and as I said is going to do that at a cheaper cost, which is definitely good news.\nBonnie Herzog: Now that's great. And then one final question from me, if I may. I just wanted to touch on the MRTP that you received and I just want to hear from you maybe next steps in terms of -- if there are chances to get to the next level of reduced risk approval. Just wanted to understand that from [indiscernible] and then timing, possibly. And then wanted to maybe better understand how you might use what the FDA granted in terms of altering or modifying your marketing plans going forward? How you might try and include that? Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thanks, Bonnie. Well, as you all can imagine, this MRTP authorization is a fantastic news and I would say both for us and for the consumers because I think it's coming as a game changer, as I know I use the word landmark. It, of course, start by validating all the scientific evidence that we have put together, and it's going to be an important element in -- and that's I think the sense of your question, how do you use this MRTP. Maybe starting with your question on the next level, of course, the FDA has left the door open to continue the dialog with them on precisely the next level. We intend to do that in the coming months. And I would say the question is whether the reduced risk authorization for marketing can come through a modified claim or through providing additional study or maybe a combination of both. That's what we intend to discuss with the FDA in the coming months and, of course, we are impatient to have this dialog with them. Now on what it means globally. Well, first of all, but it's quite important, we hope it's going to start the discussion on whether IQOS and heat-not-burn technology is a better product than combustible cigarette. I think that it's very, very important confirmation. And it really should put the focus on how we make this better alternative for the smoker as fast as possible, I would say, and in the broadest possible geographies and that's really what it means. So we think that as the FDA is recognized as a very highly regarded regulator, as they are coming from me with the right approach, where they are both dealing with review of reducing arms on tobacco-product and at the same time, the continued restriction on tobacco usage, we think that this is the right approach that we are going to be able to, I would say, share with other regulator and we are hopeful that, of course, people will look at this decision and will draw conclusion on that. Let's be clear, we already have this type of decision with several regulatory in the world. So we think it's just going to amplify that. And we are beyond the U.S., where now we have the authorization to market as a reduce exposure. We are already in other country communicating on that reduce exposure of our IQOS product. So it's going in the right direction to, I think, really define what should be the right priorities, and hopefully, it's going to accelerate things globally.\nBonnie Herzog: Thank you very much.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Rampton of UBS.\nRobert Rampton: Hello, three questions from me. The first is on Indonesia, can you help me understand where the Indonesian market should be from a revenue perspective? If price enforcement takes place, should revenue perspective reach 2019 levels, but from a lower volume base, or is that market just going to deliver 20%? Has that revenue from that market has been rebased down 20% till the lower price tier ratio with these results [ph]? Thanks.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Hi, Robert. If I understand well your question, you're asking what we should think about Indonesia beyond the COVID crisis and what we should understand. So, let's be clear, you have really two dimension that we need to explain on the situation in Indonesia. Well, the first one, of course, is everything related to the COVID crisis. To start with, remember that we started the year before the COVID crisis flagging the fact that Indonesia would be difficult in 2020. There was a double, I would say excise duty increase at the beginning of the year. We have been leading the price positioning in the market for quite a while in Indonesia and we have not been increasing price at the end of 2019. So, that's what's creating difficulty and we were saying that this difficulty would last until the minimum retail selling price is implemented. Then the COVID crisis started, and obviously, that has been creating a total disruption of the market. We have seen what we have seen in other new economy with impact on the consumption driven by daily wage worker, reducing their daily average consumption. I mean, is it 20%, 30%? Difficult to define. But that has been impacting, and as we flagged, it has been probably more impactful in urban areas than in the countryside. We have seen some down-trading as there were some pressure on purchasing power and there has been also in the regions of market some evolution to well certain category where we have a lower representation again in line with down-trading. On top of that there was this second-tier system on the excise duty due to or corresponding to low volume or supposed to be low volume company that are benefiting from a much lower excise duty and which can generate a price differential of 40% to 50% versus the Tier 1 system. So it's very substantial. We talk about a market where this cigarette of the second tier system can enjoy a significantly lower price. And, of course, at the time of down-trading consumer has been looking for cheaper alternative, and this market was supposed to stay at a very low level because this was supposed to only be granted to very small level of production. There has been some abuse on the way this has been played, and this second tier category has reached in Q2 25% of the market, which as you can imagine on something which was based on reduced volume was not at all the intention, and that has further disrupted the market. Now when we see these various headwinds that we have been facing, what can we expect? Well, first of all, regarding the minimum retail selling price implementation, it has now started. It's going to be implemented through Q3, but we don't expect really to impact in Q3, and therefore, we can expect to see the benefit of that in Q4. So that's going to be a first element that is going to improve the situation. Second, we are, of course, being active in trying to make sure that we developed our brands and we launched offer in the most dynamic part of the market, and I've been referring to Dji Sam Soe and Marlboro on which we are launching extension in dynamic part of the market. We expect globally as the COVID crisis pass and we know that next year people, economists are expecting a strong rebound of the Indonesian economy, so we expect globally also the pressure on down-trading to reduce as the economy is improving; the daily consumption to also improve, so that should help the trend. And last element that, of course, we don't control is this second tier category where we will need and we think is going to happen because otherwise, it's going to massively decrease the income of the country, but there is a need for reform to limit the benefit or change the structure of the excise duty depending on the values category. Well, at the end of the day to create level playing field and for all players to be playing on the kind of equal basis and we are certainly hoping that it's going to impact -- is going to arrive as soon as possible. If everything that I've just been described -- describing happen, well, there is no reason why we cannot rebound in Indonesia and be back to our market share that we experienced in the past years. Our brands are extremely strong. We have an incredible commercial machine in the country, and all that are, of course, the strengths on which we will build our rebound in the coming quarters.\nRobert Rampton: Great, thank you. Thank you very much.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nRobert Rampton: Sorry, my next question -- my next question is on down-trading, and I know you flagged Indonesia and that you don't expect down-trading going forward, but are there any more -- can you flag which markets you have seen down-trading? Is it mostly EM [ph]?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes. What we flagged is that down-trading may have accelerated in a few countries where it was probably already visible before the crisis started, so we talk about Turkey, we could talk about Mexico. These are typically in addition with Indonesia. These are the markets where we have seen I would say increased pressure on purchasing power triggering down-trading. Now for the future, of course, nobody knows what's going to be the impact of the economic crisis that everybody is forecasting. We've been there before, so that will not be the first time that we are managing a very tough environment and we have shown in the past that we have an absolute capacity to manage this kind of environment with the agility, with the headroom and with the levers to manage this kind of environment. So we would see and we will adapt to the situation.\nRobert Rampton: Great. Thank you very much. That's it for me.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of Piper Sandler.\nMichael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning. Can you update on the HEETS launch in Japan? And just you called out I think a little bit of mix pressure that surely would have come from that, and we saw the share gains, but maybe give us a sense of how it's tracking relative to your expectations and what sort of margin impact that has on your business there?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Sure, Michael. So, probably, Japan is at the forefront of what you can expect in many countries as it get more mature, I would say, on the growth of the heat-not-burn and IQOS. I think it makes sense to have several offering for the customers. And in Japan, I think, probably, my first comment will be on the fact that the market did perform well. Clearly, in H1 and in Q2, we have been growing double-digit our shipments and end-market sales in Japan in Q2 for heat-not-burn globally. So as you can see, it's a market that continue to grow very nicely, and certainly, HEETS has been a contributor to that. So the fact that we are playing with both Marlboro and HEETS enable us to really capture maximum opportunity in the market. And we see a very, very positive trend on HEETS, which has captured close to 4% of the market. So you see that it's already a sizable part of our RRP business in Japan, and that bodes very well for what we can do with two brands in the country.\nMichael Lavery: Okay, great. Thanks. Could you also just clarify, in Indonesia, you gave color that in your guidance thinking you don't expect enforcement of minimum prices at least until September? As far as 4Q goes, what's your base case thinking? Is your thinking reflected in guidance that there is no enforcement all year, or is there built-in some assumption that does improve?\nEmmanuel Babeau: No. What is taken in the guidance is essentially that we should have a large part of the benefit in Q4. So, we're not expecting anything in Q3, but we think a large part of the benefit of having minimum retail selling price should be seen in Q4.\nMichael Lavery: Okay, great. And just one last one. On Mexico, where the government has banned the import of heated tobacco devices, can you just give us a sense? You had just been getting underway there with your IQOS launch. So it's sort of maybe hitting it before hits momentum, but how you navigate that and how does that look?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes. So -- you're absolutely right Michael. So the good news is that we had the right level of inventory before this ban happened. So we are not facing out of stock situation. So, of course, we hope it is not going to last too much because we are not saying that we have some devices or inventory for several years, but for the time being, it's not an issue. We are hopeful that Mexico is going to look at the FDA decision and that will influence their decision on [indiscernible]. But it's -- as you know, it's not targeted to IQOS. So we're just unfortunately here the [indiscernible] of a broader decision, if I may say. Hopefully, they will come back on that one rapidly and that will allow us to resume the export to Mexico of devices.\nMichael Lavery: Okay, great. Thank you very much.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Spielman of Citi.\nAdam Spielman: Hi, thank you very much. I've got three questions for you. The first one is really about EPS guidance. In June, you forecasted, sorry -- in June, you forecasted EPS at below $1.10, it turned out that was wrong by about $0.20 for the quarter that ended in June. You're now giving guidance with a $0.15 range. And I just wonder why you think that range is appropriate given your inability to forecast even a month ahead accurately. So, that's the first question. It is about the range, I mean, of why...\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes. No, I understand, Adam. Thank you for the question. Well, let's face the reality of number, it's not $0.20 because what we are saying is that we have, I would say, a big half of the $0.20, as you said, that is coming from one-off factor that's going to be compensated in Q3. So it's not as if we had missed the landing, it's just that the number of fact that we could not anticipate at the beginning of June happened at the end of June and that helped the landing of Q2. Now, you're right, there is approximately $0.08 to $0.09 that we deliver above the anticipation at the beginning of June and I would say, that's -- I mean, the month of June has been very important, because in fact, we all realize that all the lockdown and the confinement last until beginning of June when things were gradually released in many, many geographies, and even if there was still a number of disruption, I think that when we look, for instance, like people not all being back to work physically, I think that we don't know when all that is going to be back to normal. So, let's assume that June was probably giving us a pretty good visibility on what we could expect for the coming months. And that's really on the basis of that that we have come to this capacity to come with this vision and guidance for the full year. So again, June has been important, the learning of June has been important and the miss has not been $0.20 but rather $0.10, and of course, the first weeks of July, as we've been saying, is confirming this kind of understanding of the environment in which we are for the time being.\nAdam Spielman: Okay. Well, fine. Okay. And implicit in that answer is there won't be a sort of unexpected $0.10 movement by the end of December. And I suppose that's an interesting point. Does that mean to say that you also basically if it looks like it's going $0.10 above, you'll somehow control it, or is it that there could be at the end of December, as there was at the end of June around $0.10 movement?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Well, and I'm of course you know I've broken my crystal ball, so I'm not able to tell you whether this kind of thing could happen. I think we're coming with a carefully considered range for the landing with a number of scenarios behind it and I think that's encapsulating several possibility and pluses and minus, as always, when you build a guidance, and we think that this is at that stage. With all the information that we have, the right guidance and the right vision for the landing, and I'm not able to say more. If there are things that we haven't been anticipating in our various scenarios that happen, that can always happen, of course, and the last months are here to remind us that we are not able to anticipate everything, well, we'll see. But for the time being, with again all the information that we have, the June till mid-July vision, we think that this is the right guidance for the end of the year.\nAdam Spielman: Okay, well, thank you very much. And it's a question that's really tough to answer than I phrase it. Can I talk about something completely different, which is the growth of margin, specifically in the RRP portfolio. So, you said in this quarter, you've been really pleased, partly because RRPs are a higher percentage of the whole business, but also within that, RRP margins have gone up, partly because you sort of moved so -- surfaced towards digital. And I guess the question is, within RRPs, how should we think about margins? So obviously, there is a whole mix thing, that's not really the question. The question is, do we think that you got to good level and yes, it will grow from now but perhaps more modestly than it does in Q2, or do you think each quarter we can see really impressive gains in RRP margins, I don't know, for the next sort of two or three years? It's a slightly long-term question, it's not a 2020 question.\nEmmanuel Babeau: No, it is, Adam and it's a very fair question. Let me be start by reminding what is the model of IQOS and RRPs. It starts with the consumable that are, as you know, enjoying today higher value on the per stick basis, okay, which is absolutely intrinsic to this RRP business and that's a business on which as well versus CC, we are also improving the way we are producing, improving productivity, and therefore, when you look at the gross margin on the HTUs, there is some positive -- so we're starting from, of course, this favorable situation that I described and there is a possibility of, I would say, a positive evolution. Then, you have the devices, okay, which we've seen is a small percentage of the total, but it's a material one. And on this one, I think, we've been clear on the fact that the margin by type of device can be different, but we can accept to sometime not make money or in some condition even lose some money, because at the end of the day, it's part of the investment that we make to acquire new customers. So that's the starting point. And then below that, of course, you have the old machine to acquire in order to convert smokers to IQOS and then to retain. And on that machine as well, we're going to improve things as we are growing the top line on RRPs. We are gaining in efficiency, we use more digital, we said it, and we are, I would say, polishing the machine, increasing at the same time the strength of the engine, but also, I would say, reducing the cost of the engine. So, that's going to keep playing positively. So, I don't know whether I should take impressive and I don't know what you put behind impressive, but you should certainly expect us to keep growing the margin on the RRPs gradually in a meaningful manner as we continue to grow on IQOS and RRPs. That's certainly our objective.\nAdam Spielman: Okay. Let me try and be a little bit more precise about impressive. You clearly not going to tell me or what the margin is precisely, but it's also clear the margin has grown very dramatically in '20 -- in the first half of 2020 versus last year. And so, I suppose the question is really should we expect something like a similar uplift again in 2021 on -- just on the RRP business, or is it going to be much more modest than the uplift was in 2020?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Adam, I won't comment on that, whether it's going to be above, below. What I can tell you is that we believe that we have some significant headroom to keep improving margin, but I won't comment further.\nAdam Spielman: Okay, that's fine. Thank you very much.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.\nVivien Azer: Hi, good morning. Thank you. My first question is on Marlboro. I appreciate the commentary around some modest down-trading that you had already been seeing in markets like Turkey and Mexico. I'm just trying to square that comment -- and those are good Marlboro markets, I'm just trying to square that commentary with the assertion that you believe that Marlboro market share will recover given its outsized exposure to social occasions. So, just wondering how much of the margin pressure do you think is really, excuse me, the market share pressure is coming from down-trading in select markets that have a high degree of exposure to Marlboro versus the social occasions? Thanks.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Well, I think that, you're right that you have the two drivers behind Marlboro and that has been -- Q2 has been a difficult quarter for Marlboro, has been losing some share both because of, you said it down-trading, and it's few markets where we can see that, but also I think to a large extent in many markets where Marlboro has a big market share because of the social movement that have almost entirely disappeared during Q2. And at the same time, by the way, you have market such as the Philippines, where Marlboro has been growing nicely as well. So, it's a mixed picture, I would say. It's not one direction and it's a bit more complex than that. But we are certainly confident that Marlboro is going to be able to rebound nicely first with everything around the social consumption, and we are going to certainly see some rebound as well even in countries, where we have seen down-trading during the period when the COVID crisis hopefully ease. When it comes to the down-trading, is it really Marlboro downward or more mid to low? So, I think even the real impact of, and I was talking about Philippines, which has been a market where the conversation has been difficult and despite that we've seen good evolution for Marlboro. I think Marlboro has been getting 3 points of market share in the quarter. So, it's quite good. So, I would say, when we talk about down-trading, I'm not sure that this has been the main impact on Marlboro, but rather again, down-trading is rather mid-pricing going to lower pricing, and the biggest impact on Marlboro we see is this absence of social moment where Marlboro is an important brand. So, we hope that will enable a good and fast rebound for the brand.\nVivien Azer: That's helpful. Thank you. And then my second question is on the IQOS development and looking quickly at your number of users and juxtaposing that against your volumes, it seems like perhaps there is a little bit of degradation in terms of average volumes per user. Is that a function of just new countries coming online and you need consumers to ramp their perhaps consumption or is there like a structural shift in terms of per capita consumption in new geographies in combustible cigarettes that would translate into HeatSticks relative to existing IQOS geographies? Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Well, Vivien, I'm not sure that we have any information that would clearly point to that. We know that Q2 has been impacted globally in the tobacco market by a lot of disruption that has been potentially influencing the daily consumption and that maybe in some markets, it can have an impact on few markets for IQOS, but frankly, we have no data and nothing pointing to that based on all the data that we have on Q2.\nVivien Azer: Understood. Thank you very much.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Pamela Kaufman of Morgan Stanley.\nPamela Kaufman: I just wanted to ask how you are thinking about the puts and takes of the current excise tax environment. There has been a number of developments during the quarter, including the Saudi Arabia VAT increase and Germany VAT reduction. So, what is the impact of these tax changes? And are you passing them through to consumers? And I guess looking forward, what is your outlook for excise taxes as a result of the economic environment and what did you see in the past following prior economic downturns?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes, thank you for the question. So, as a general rule, yes, we are passing on this tax evolution whether on excise duty or VAT, that's a general rule. But maybe more important is the comment on what we can expect for the coming quarters in term of evolution of the tax environment. Well, it is true and that's certainly the sense behind your question that many countries are going to face higher deficit -- budget deficit because of the crisis and the temptation could be there to try to find way to finance it. First of all, this type of decision is usually made in the fourth quarter of the year. So, probably end of the Q3, beginning of Q4. So we know more at the time. But I have the feeling that versus maybe what happened in 2008-2009, here, the environment is quite different and many governments are rather trying not to depress the consumption and you know that when you increase price, at the end of the day, you're not too sure about the net impact you're going to get on your -- on the money that you're going to receive. And therefore, it remains to be seen what's going to be the decision in term of tax increase of all nature. I think it's not clear. Well, if it was the case, as I said, we've seen that in the past in 2008/2009 as -- again, there is probably a different way to approach the crisis, as seen a lot of excise duty increase in many countries and I think we've shown our capacity to, of course, weather this kind of environment, and I would say, overcome this kind of headwind and we have no doubt that if it was the case, we would do that again. But, and I reiterate my but, it could be quite different this time and that is at least what we are hearing from a number of politicians and governments.\nPamela Kaufman: Thank you. And then I was wondering if you could provide more color on the trends that you saw exiting the second quarter. You highlighted that there was a particular recovery in Europe. And can you comment on what trends you're seeing across other regions? And then, I guess more broadly, how are you thinking about the volume trends across markets in your 7% to 9% industry volume forecast for this year? I guess what are the differences between emerging and developed markets and the drivers behind that forecast?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Well, sure. I should probably be back to what we've been sharing about our expectation for Q3. So, we are, as we said in June and first weeks of July, seeing a kind of gradual improvement of the market, the global lockdown are over. We -- doesn't mean that we are back to normal, but as I said, we start to see the market operating maybe in a more consistent manner and with a bit less disruption. So, that is a trend that we've been flagging on June, but -- so that is why we are saying that we expect for Q3, net revenue that will be in sequential improvement versus Q2. So, that's exactly what is behind our vision for the rest of the year. It doesn't mean that we're going to be back on the growth year-on-year, and also, of course, in addition to that, we have some negative impact coming from H1 that's going to play on the top line and we said about 1% in Q3, but we are going to continue to see in Q3 some year-on-year negative evolution because lot of market remain extremely disrupted, and of course, I've been talking about Duty Free, Indonesia, but many other markets are going to be disrupted because of the COVID crisis, because of the restriction, because of potentially some impact on the economy. So, all that is going to play and impact us. I'm not going to enter into trajectory by market, but certainly we would expect the mature economy and that's probably what we've seen in -- at the end of the quarter to show some good resilience in this environment and maybe less disruption versus a new economy. That would be in the ballpark our feeling. And then, if we enter Q4, as we said, we continue to expect an improvement on net revenue for Q4 versus Q2 -- Q3, so sequentially, we're going to keep improving the net revenue number, but nevertheless, Q4 could still be negative year-on-year. And so, we really have to make the difference between the quarter-on-quarter trend, the sequential trend and then the year-on-year comparison.\nPamela Kaufman: Thank you. And just my last question. Russia has been an important market for IQOS growth. Can you comment on what you're anticipating from the economic environment and its impact on IQOS adoption in Russia? And what has been the performance for your super premium HeatSticks launch? Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Well, IQOS has been doing very well in Russia in Q2 in this environment. So it's, of course, I cannot say that there was no impact from the disruption, some lockdown in Russia, but we continue to grow share for IQOS and we are pleased with the evolution of our RRP in this market. Altogether, the Russian market has probably been impacted but in a minor way by the evolution. So, when you look at the volume, it was down, it was not with a strong acceleration in the underlying decline in volume that we have seen in Q2. So, that's a market that has resisted pretty well through this COVID crisis, and again, we are very pleased with the IQOS development. I'm not going to elaborate on what is going to be the trend in the next two quarters. We expect the IQOS market share to keep growing and that we're going to continue to perform well on IQOS. The good news is that we also maintain market share in CC at the same time. So, that was a nice achievement.\nPamela Kaufman: Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Owen Bennett of Jefferies.\nOwen Bennett: Good afternoon and hope you all well. I'll keep this very quick. So, I just wanted to come back to the sequential industry volume improvement in the EU in June. I was just wondering is it possible to break that out between cigarettes and IQOS and what was the main driver there? Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Well, yes, indeed we have seen in June, with the end of the lockdown in many countries, an improvement of the trend. I would say IQOS has been doing well, as we said, through the quarter. So, of course, we've seen some acceleration in June, but the whole quarter has been good for IQOS, and clearly, we have seen some acceleration in the CC business, which has been quite impacted by the lockdown in some geographies and we've seen some improvement in June. All markets are not being equal, and notably, the markets that are impacted by lower tourism have been more penalized and I talk about Southern Europe here. Of course, the markets typically see a lot of purchase being made abroad and a lot of cross-border activity with the border being closed. I mean, they've been globally doing better through the quarter. So, this is a kind of trend that we have seen in Europe.\nOwen Bennett: Okay, very helpful. Thanks very much.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: And that was our final question. I'll turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.\nNick Rolli: Thank you very much for joining us today. That concludes our call. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations team. Thank you again. Stay well and have a great day. Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you all. Talk to you soon. Thanks. Bye.\nOperator: And thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Emmanuel Babeau",
            "content": "Thank you, Nick and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I hope everyone listening to the call and those close to you are safe and well. Our main focus remains the health and well-being of our employees, their families, and the communities in which we operate. During restrictions, we have implemented stringent policy and measures to minimize risk for those who continue to work in our facilities and offices. For all our employees, including those working from home, providing guidance and support is also essential. We are now facilitating a gradual, carefully managed return to the workplace in some location, where local condition and authorities restrictions allow. The strength and spirit shown in this challenging time by the people that make up our organization continues to be a real inspiration to me and the PMI management team, and I'd like to take this opportunity to thank them for their outstanding efforts. I now turn to the business, which delivered a robust performance in the first half of the year despite the unprecedented circumstances of the pandemic. Most importantly, the continued momentum of IQOS was excellent with an estimated 15.4 million users at the end of the second quarter. Our commercial model pivoted rapidly to digital and remote engagements, while preserving high rates of IQOS' user acquisition and brand retention. With volumes of heated tobacco units growing 24% in Q2 2020 compared to the prior year, RRPs made up almost one quarter of our net revenues. In addition, after two very difficult months in the quarter due to the pandemic, our combustible business is now improving. Industry volumes started to recover in June and the beginning of July, reflecting the gradual easing of confinement in many countries. The improvement was particularly driven by the EU, our largest region in term of net revenue and adjusted operating income. The main enduring headwinds linked to COVID-related restrictions are the absence of recovery in duty-free; and in Indonesia, where this is compounded by pricing dynamics. Economic uncertainty remains and we all hope for no major resurgence of the pandemic. Notably, despite additional COVID-related expenses, our operating margin has been strong in both the second quarter and first half. This reflects the increasing mix of RRPs in our business and their improving profitability. Productivity savings in manufacturing across RRPs and combustible, SG&A savings from the pivot to digital, the elimination of -- or postponement of certain lower priority projects and the operating leverage of higher RRP volumes all contributed. Indeed, it is no coincidence that the three regions where RRPs have a strong presence are driving this margin performance. We reached a truly historic milestone for IQOS, our mission and our future growth prospect on July 7 with the FDA's authorization of IQOS as a modified risk tobacco product. IQOS is the first electronic nicotine product to receive an MRTP order. Following a review of our extensive scientific evidence package, the agency found that an exposure modification order for IQOS is appropriate to promote the public health in the United States, demonstrating that IQOS is fundamentally different product from combustible cigarette and a better choice for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke. The agency concluded that issuing the order for IQOS is expected to benefit the health of the population as a whole taking into account both user of tobacco product and person who do not currently use tobacco product. A critical enabler for the future growth of RRPs is the implementation of differentiated regulatory framework that can help encourage adults who would otherwise continue to smoke to instead switch to better alternatives, in line with the harm reduction principle. The authorization allows a version of IQOS to be marketed with information confirming the validity of our scientific studies with regard to the significant reduction of exposure to the harmful and potentially harmful chemicals contained in cigarette smoke. The FDA decision and subsequent comprehensive post-market controls and monitoring, focusing on use prevention provide an important example of how government and public health organization around the world can implement an inclusive, science-based approach to help rapidly shift adult smokers who would otherwise continue smoking to better options while simultaneously guarding against unintended consequences. With investors increasingly focused on environmental, social, and governance aspect, I would like to highlight our recently published Integrated Report for 2019. The report covers a variety of important ESG topics and measures, including our business transformation metrics. Notably, our expanded aspirational targets now include new goals for the number of users of our smoke-free product in non-OECD countries and youth access prevention. The report is available on our website at pmi.com. Let's turn now to our strong performance over the first half of the year. This was clearly a very challenging period with disruption to many aspects of our operations, including our supply chain and route-to-market. I am proud to say that our organization has the strength and agility to withstand this with limited impact on supply to our consumer and trade partners. Despite these unprecedented headwinds across many of our key markets, our currency-neutral net revenues helped by a strong first quarter were close to flat versus the prior year on a like-for-like basis. Driven by pricing in combustible, manufacturing and SG&A efficiency and the dual RRP margin effect of growing weight and improving profitability, our adjusted operating income margin increased over 200 basis points to deliver 8% adjusted diluted EPS growth, all on the like-for-like ex-currency basis. I focus now on our second quarter performance. The effect of confinement on mobility impacted daily consumption pattern in certain markets, including those of daily income workers in developing countries and disrupted the retail trade. This led to significant industry volume decline in a number of geographies during April and May, which primarily impacted our combustible business. As expected, duty-free sales were weak. The March build-up of trade and distributor inventory largely reversed in the first part of the quarter, and we had to delay a few pricing decisions. This period also coincided with a challenging prior year comparison. Notwithstanding these challenges, our performance was better than we expected when we last updated our guidance on June 11.  Currency-neutral net revenue declined 9.5% compared to our assumption of around the high end of minus 8% to minus 12%. Given this net revenue decline and the strong prior year profitability, we were pleased to maintain a stable adjusted operating income margin. This was supported by growth in the net revenues and profitability of RRPs and cost efficiencies. Combustible pricing of 3.3% also contributed and reflect robust pricing in many markets, partly offset by Indonesia and a strong prior year comparison in Turkey. Reported diluted EPS of $1.25 was notably better than the upper end of our previous guidance range, including a lower currency impact of $0.06. Our adjusted diluted EPS was $1.29, excluding reporting adjustment for asset impairment and exit cost, which represents an ex-currency decline of 7.5% compared to the prior year. There were three main drivers of this better-than-anticipated performance. First, the recovery of industry volume in June, notably in the higher-margin EU region, benefited our net revenues and margin. Second, IQOS user acquisition grew substantially in the same month with markets such as Russia back to pre-COVID rate and overall IQOS acquisition for the quarter only 35% below pre-pandemic levels. Last, we had the benefit of certain non-underlying factors. These include trade inventory movement in June ahead of tax and regulatory changes in Germany, Russia and Saudi Arabia, cost phasing, and a lower tax charge, largely driven by a reduced corporate income tax rate in Indonesia, as well as changes in our earnings mix. These data [ph] factors accounted for approximately $0.10 of the better EPS performance. Before we come to guidance, I will outline some of the dynamics for the second half of the year. We expect a gradual underlying improvement in the combustible business coupled with continued robust growth for IQOS. The pandemic continues to present an uncertain operating environment with a potential for tightened restriction in localized areas. While not included in our guidance assumption, there also remain a non-negligible risk of a resurgence in the virus and the return of national lockdowns. The full economic fallout of the various restriction is also unclear. This said, we observe relative stability in term of pandemic restriction and improving visibility across a number of geographies in recent weeks. Conversely, visibility remains lower in some areas such as Indonesia and Latin America, in addition to the absence of any recovery so far in Duty Free, which as a reminder represented close to 4% of our net revenues in 2019. In term of our cigarette business, while underlying industry volumes are gradually improving as restrictions ease, we assume that the return to a normal level of consumption occasion for consumer will take time. We do not assume significant widespread increase in down-trading with such dynamic currently concentrated in markets were a trend already existed due to elevated price gaps. It is reasonable to expect some delays in the timing of pricing in certain markets due to the pandemic situation. In RRPs, sales of devices and HTUs are performing strongly, reflecting the better-than- expected IQOS user acquisition and continued strong brand retention and conversion. Our unique commercial model has demonstrated the flexibility to accelerate the shift to digital and remote activity and we continue with high level of such engagement in markets where stores are reopened. Despite the exceptional headwinds of 2020, we expect to grow our full year adjusted diluted EPS between plus 2% and plus 5% on the currency-neutral like-for-like basis. This corresponds to an adjusted diluted EPS range of $4.92 to $5.07, including an estimated unfavorable currency impact at prevailing exchange rate of $0.31. This forecast assumes a total industry decline of 7% to 9%, excluding the U.S. and China, and a decline in total PMI shipment volume of 8% to 10% on the like-for-like basis due notably to Duty Free and Indonesia. With regard to net revenue, in like-for-like ex-currency term, we assume low-single digit growth, excluding Duty Free and Indonesia. Due to these two factors, our overall net revenue may see a modest decline. The forecast also reflect expansion in our ex-currency like-for-like adjusted operating income margin of more than 150 basis points. We expect the full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23%, 2020 operating cash flow of at least $9 billion and $0.7 billion of capital expenditures. All these estimates assume that national lockdowns will not recur in our key international markets in the remainder of the year. Specifically for the second half, while underlying trends should gradually improve, we expect the recovery in our growth to be skewed towards the fourth quarter. This assumes the progressive easing of restrictions across the remaining markets with commensurate greater industry recovery towards the end of the year and the compound effect of increased sequential IQOS user acquisition. In the third quarter, we expect the reversal of certain one-time benefit from the first half, with an EPS impact of approximately $0.10 and a net revenue impact of around 1%. The continuation of headwinds in Duty Free and Indonesia, the timing of 2020 pricing in certain markets and the phasing in of costs are also included in our assumptions. We expect to see a good sequential improvement in reported net revenues in the third quarter, but a decline compared to the challenging prior year comparison. For adjusted EPS, also due to the timing of certain SG&A cost and the one-off item of the first half, we expect Q3 2020 to be broadly in line with Q2 2020. Sequential improvement in reported net revenue should continue in the fourth quarter although likely still in slightly negative territory compared to 2019. Growth in adjusted EPS will also be driven by a greater expected realization of cost efficiency from new initiatives. I will now cover our second quarter performance in more detail. As expected, our shipment volumes were weak, driven by the effect of marked industry declines on our combustible volume due to pandemic-related lockdown measures. Notable market contributors to this decline were Indonesia, Mexico and the Philippines, all of which were impacted by restrictions, loss of income for daily wage workers, and significant price increases. Conversely, our HTU shipment volumes continued to grow strongly to reach a record 18.7 billion units, driven by the EU region, Japan, and Russia. While overall volume in the quarter was weak, the sequential recovery seen in June and the beginning of July is more encouraging. Our combined June in-market sales volume was the highest monthly total this year and grew 2.8% compared to June 2019. Though this growth includes an estimated 3 billion unit effect from inventory movements, it mainly reflect better industry dynamics across many geographies, notably the EU region, which declined by 7.3% in Q2 overall, but grew in June. We are also encouraged by the sequential improvement in HTU volumes, which exhibited positive year-on-year growth throughout the quarter. This strong performance from IQOS mean that heated tobacco units made up over 10% of our total shipment volume in the first half of the year as compared to approximately 8% in 2019 and 5% in 2018. While somewhat flattened in Q2 2020 by weaker combustible volume, we expect this proportion to grow over time as our positive momentum on RRPs continues. RRP net revenues reached $3.2 billion in the first half, reaching almost one quarter of PMI's total net revenue in Q2. IQOS devices accounted for approximately 8% of RRP net revenue in the second quarter due to a lower ratio of new user to existing user, given pandemic effect, longer replacement cycle and geographic mix, as in some countries, we still sell a substantial amount of the lower priced IQOS 2.4 Plus device. Turning now to market share. Our total international share declined by 0.1 point to 28% in the second quarter with higher share for heated tobacco units, which increased by 0.9 points to reach 3%, offset by lower share for cigarettes. Our market share was negatively impacted by Indonesia and the market mix effect of Duty Free, where volumes dropped sharply and our share is typically much higher than our overall international share. The cannibalization effect of out-switching to IQOS were essentially offset by positive impact elsewhere, and in markets where IQOS has a meaningful presence, our share increased with almost no exceptions. It follows that our combined market share increased notably in the EU region, Japan, and Russia. It's also true that in many markets Marlboro over-indexes to social consumption occasions, which were naturally lower during COVID-related confinements. We expect Marlboro share to recover as restrictions ease. Indonesia cigarette market saw an accumulation of headwinds in the second quarter. A pronounced impact from pandemic-related restriction on daily consumption added to the effect of tax-driven pricing and retail disruption. Industry volumes declined by 22%, excluding trade inventory movement whereas our shipments declined 28%. Our share decline can be attributed to three broad dynamics. First, within the Tier 1 segment, price gaps remain elevated, given our price leadership of the past 18 months and the delay in the enforcement of the minimum retail price. Combined with COVID effect, this has contributed to the end of performance of our premium-skewed portfolio despite better sequential performance from A Mild. The process of minimum selling price enforcement has started. Government inspectors have returned to the field. However, the full enforcement and subsequent trade flow-through of compliant product may not be complete until the fourth quarter. Second is the strong growth of the tax-advantaged below Tier 1 segment, which in conjunction with the tax-driven pricing and pandemic situation of 2020, has led to increased down-trading. This was designed for small players with production below a certain volume threshold. However, the segment is not operating within the spirit and intent of the law. With the segments now at approximately 25% of the market, this represents a serious threat to government excise revenue and the correction of volume-based tax tiers become urgent. Third, the stricter public mobility restriction in urban areas, where our share is higher, has disproportionately impacted our portfolio. However, our market share sequentially improved in June, supported by strength of our brands. While we see sign of improvement in the market, the situation remains challenging. We now assume the total industry decline will be approximately 15% for the full year, reflecting progressive sequential improvement in daily consumption from the particularly weak second quarter. We are fully committed to improving our performance in this key market. We have a number of ongoing commercial initiatives to leverage equity of our brand portfolio through the remainder of the year. This includes the introduction of new variants in the growing SKT and full-flavor SKM segments such as the Dji Sam Soe 12 launched in March and Marlboro Filter Black 16 launched this month. However, with enforcement of the minimum retail price now underway, the main outstanding structural issue is the volume-tiered tax system, which clearly advantages growth of the super-low segment. In the status quo, this will have a significant impact on government excise revenue this year. We concur with the public policy expert and economist that urge the government to create more predictability and a level playing field by reforming the multi-tier excise tax structure and enforcing the minimum retail selling price without exception across Indonesia. Overall, while short-term challenges remain, the structural headwinds in the market are addressable through government action. The headwinds directly related to the pandemic are likely to be temporary in nature and our brands are strong, giving us a solid platform to rebuild our share. I shift now to our RRP performance. We estimate that there were 15.4 million total IQOS users as of June 30, compared to an estimated 14.6 million last quarter. This represents the addition of around 4 million adult users since the same time last year, a phenomenal achievement given the circumstances. This reflects widespread user growth momentum across all key IQOS geographies, including Japan, the EU region, and Russia. We further estimate that 72% of this total or 11.2 million adult smokers have stopped smoking and switched to IQOS with the balance in various stages of conversion. We observe early indication that the propensity of smoker to switch to RRPs is trending positively since the pandemic began, and we will see how this develops in the coming period. We are also optimistic that the FDA's granting of the modified risk tobacco product order for a version of IQOS will contribute over time to better understanding of the heated tobacco category and the benefit of switching to IQOS compared to continued smoking. The overall share performance of IQOS HTUs continues to see excellent progress. Indeed, in international markets where IQOS has been commercialized, IQOS HTUs were again the third largest brand in the second quarter with 6.3% share, increasing from 4.5% in Q2 2019 on the comparable market footprint. This was achieved despite not having full national distribution in many markets. In the EU region, we added a record number of IQOS users in the second quarter to reach 4.3 million, an impressive performance given the context of the pandemic. This includes strong growth in Italy, the Czech Republic, Poland, and Germany, and in historically slower markets such as the U.K. where HTU volumes increased more than five-fold over the prior year quarter and Spain. National offtake share surpassed 1% in both of these latter markets despite limited disruption -- distribution, sorry. Second quarter share of HEETS reached 3.9% of total industry volume, which was depressed by an estimated 0.2 points, due to consumer pantry loading effect. Sequential share increased by 0.3 point on an adjusted basis, with in-market sales volume 5% higher compared to Q1 2020. I also refer you to the appendix, where we show share for key EU markets and global key cities, which serve as a useful indicator for national share growth potential. IQOS continued its strong performance in Russia with its share up by 3 points to reach 5.9%. On a sequential basis versus the first quarter of 2020, HEETS share decreased by 0.6 points, reflecting a higher combustible market in the quarter due to increased daily consumption in the warmer months and a trade inventory build-up ahead of the July introduction of the track-and-trace system. A more reliable indicator is a sequential in-market sales, which increased by approximately 12% compared to 3% sequential growth in the first quarter. In Japan, our total reported share for heated tobacco units reached 20% in the second quarter, supported by line extension for both Marlboro HeatSticks and HEETS. IQOS user grew to an estimated total of 5.8 million, of which an estimated 4.3 million have stopped smoking and switched to IQOS. On an adjusted total tobacco view, including cigarillos and adjusted for trade inventory movement, the share for our HTU brands increased by 2 points versus the prior year quarter and by 0.7 points sequentially to 18.5%. Q2 2020 adjusted in-market sales volume for our HTU brands grew 4.9% sequentially. This helped drive growth of the overall heated tobacco category to second quarter total tobacco share of over 25%. In addition to strong RRP growth in existing markets, the geographical expansion of IQOS continues. Despite pandemic-related restriction, we leverage our digital capabilities to launch in four new markets; Austria, North Macedonia, Montenegro, and Saudi Arabia. This takes the total number of markets where IQOS is available for sale to 57. Importantly, we still plan to expand our portfolio of smoke-free offering in the second half of the year with the launches of IQOS VEEV in the e-vapor category and of licensed KT&G product in select markets. To conclude on the today's presentation, our growth prospects remain strong. The continued momentum of IQOS through the unprecedented circumstances of the COVID pandemic demonstrates the structural growth characteristic of RRPs and we are on track to reach our 2021 target of 90 billion to 100 billion shipments of heated tobacco units. RRPs now make up almost 25% of our net revenue and we expect this percentage to grow over time. With digital efficiency, operating leverage from scale effect, and productivity saving simultaneously driving up the profitability of RRPs, this is a very positive dynamic for our margin outlook. The historic milestone of modified risk tobacco product authorization for IQOS is a further testament to the integrity of the product and brand proposition and underlying the need for government to implement science-based regulation. In addition, after a difficult April and May, the industry recovery has now started, providing better visibility for the rest of the year. It is also now clear that the effect of the pandemic on the Duty Free business and the specific dynamic in Indonesia will persist for at least another quarter. These factors are reflected in our expectation of sequential improvement through the second half of 2020. We assume the global economic backdrop is likely to affect total cigarette volume and induce some down-trading in certain markets. This is a dynamic we have faced before in a variety of markets where we have demonstrated robust business performance. As a reminder, we expect the unprecedented declines in Q2 2020 to reverse next year easing comparison. We also remain committed to increasing our market share through the growth of RRPs and by maintaining our leadership position in combustible. This is supported by a continued sharp focus on costs. We remain on track to deliver our target of over $1 billion in efficiency by 2021 through both manufacturing productivity and SG&A savings. We have additional opportunities on top of this from changes in our post-pandemic way of working, including the acceleration of digital activities. Importantly, our balance sheet and financial position are strong and our commitment to the dividend remains unwavering. Last, when COVID-related headwinds abate, we expect to resume growth consistent with the currency-neutral compound annual growth rate in our 2019-2021 algorithm of at least 5% net revenue growth and at least 8% adjusted diluted EPS growth. Thank you. I am now happy to answer your questions. Good morning. Yes. Sure, Chris. Well, of course, IQOS remains our our top priority and we are focusing our efforts and investments behind IQOS. So, even in this challenging environment, we kept investing behind IQOS. Of course, we had to take into account the evolution of the environment and there was a number of investments that had to be postponed because they were no longer making sense. So, it was not possible to adjust and do them. There were a number of things on the commercial model that we had to revisit, and notably, when they were involving face-to-face contact. There were launches of new product that we were working on that we had to delay. So, there were clearly versus initial plan some reduction in the investment, but we absolutely stayed committed to keep increasing investment behind IQOS. I would say for me, the good thing of this Q2 and the H1 as a whole is that we see that the investments are getting an increasing return as we are, first, on that, what I would call the fixed part of the investment, the structure that we have to invest behind our RRPs and IQOS, we are growing volume. So, we amortized this investment over a larger volume and sales. So, we decreased the first, fixed cost, if you want, and we increased profitability through that. And there is also a variable part on the investment in term of consumer acquisition or retention, and here I would say through the crisis, we are of course already working on that. Wecertainly have been accelerating the usage of digital customer experience and way to engage with them in a more efficient, more digital manner, and that is going to be more scalable, that is going to reduce this variable cost per user, which is also very good news for the future of IQOS and IQOS profitability. Yes. Well, of course, we have to take into account the environment when it comes to price increase. It is clear that in markets that are severely disrupted, where the trade is disrupted, where there is some very challenging evolution in some places because of the lockdown, we have to revisit plan for increasing price. So, it is clear that we take that into account. It doesn't change the potential of price increase that we absolutely retain and that once the COVID has passed, we will continue to implement. But clearly, in this environment, we are seeing that we were planning in a normal environment that are neither, I would say, desirable nor doable in the current environment, and that could include some delay and I think we are flagging that for Q3, where there was last year a number of price increase; and this year, I think it could be more skewed towards Q4 when things are normalizing hopefully. Thank you. Yes, thanks for the question. So, you're absolutely right. As you all know the menthol ban came into force on the 20th of May. And really, that means that it has played over the month of June. I think it's premature to say that we have benefited from that. As you know, we have an under-exposure to the category. So, that is probably a positive evolution for us in terms of evolution of the market. I would not say that the IQOS evolution is obviously impacted by that. I cannot exclude that it has been helping a little bit, but I would say IQOS in the EU behaved well through the quarter; once again underlines the strength of IQOS in the EU through this second quarter. And I would expect probably Q3 to bring more answer on the impact of the menthol ban both on IQOS possibly and on the impact on the rest of the CC category. Well, if you allow me, I'm not going to enter now into the comment of 2021, we'll do that in due course. But I can like you come to the pure look at the fact that indeed we have a depressed Q2. We have a market Duty Free that is very severely impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, and if things were back to normal next year, that would globally mean a favorable basis of comparison. But at this stage, I will keep with this simple fact-based possibility, if this was a scenario being confirmed, and in due course, of course, we'll share with you what it could mean for our '21 outlook, but it's too early to comment. Well, EU is certainly important, but I think we have a global exposure. You're right, we're not in the U.S., we're not in China, but it doesn't mean that we're not benefiting from U.S. and Chinese travelers when they're traveling to other airport. So, EU, I would say, area is important, but our exposure is much, much broader than that, and therefore, it cannot be summarized to European exposure if you want. No. Well, I don't think we give that split, but I can tell you that this would be 12% [ph], if I was to characterize it. Thank you. Thanks, Bonnie for the question. Of course, we can share what we can share both by the way for confidentiality reason because it's part of the recipe of the success and as we gather the information, clearly, we've been accelerating on engaging with our customers through digital. So the initial model, as you know, was first -- not only, but first center around personnel contact through shops, through coaches and engaging into explaining to smokers the benefit of switching to IQOS. Truth, it has started, we did not discover that with the COVID crisis. But, of course, in front of market that where lockdown and people confine at home, we had to accelerate the plan on digital engagement and to develop all the tools through all the digital contacts and people were, of course, at home using a lot Internet to develop full interaction and full capacity to contact first, explain, follow and, of course, using a totally remote experience for our consumer. So, I'm not able to give you and I'm not sure that we would like to share that because it's quite sensitive, but I can tell you that we see the percentage of IQOS and fully managed customer through digital, which is increasing very fast and becoming very important. And, of course, the beauty of that is that it is easily scalable at a cheaper cost, which was probably more difficult when it was a full human-related experience. And again, I think that this H1 2020 will remain a landmark for our IQOS business for a number of reason; the MRTP decision is one; the improvement on profitability on the RRP business is another one; but, certainly, the acceleration of our digital model on acquisition and on retention for our IQOS customer is another one. Well, I would not go as far as to say that we are now at that stage coming with a vision that is going to accelerate things. But it is, certainly, confirming that our ambition is absolutely legitimate. We are confirming the 90 billion to 100 billion stick next year, and this is going to come from the continuation of a very strong acquisition of new IQOS users. No doubt that this digital play is going to help us achieving that goal, and as I said is going to do that at a cheaper cost, which is definitely good news. Thanks, Bonnie. Well, as you all can imagine, this MRTP authorization is a fantastic news and I would say both for us and for the consumers because I think it's coming as a game changer, as I know I use the word landmark. It, of course, start by validating all the scientific evidence that we have put together, and it's going to be an important element in -- and that's I think the sense of your question, how do you use this MRTP. Maybe starting with your question on the next level, of course, the FDA has left the door open to continue the dialog with them on precisely the next level. We intend to do that in the coming months. And I would say the question is whether the reduced risk authorization for marketing can come through a modified claim or through providing additional study or maybe a combination of both. That's what we intend to discuss with the FDA in the coming months and, of course, we are impatient to have this dialog with them. Now on what it means globally. Well, first of all, but it's quite important, we hope it's going to start the discussion on whether IQOS and heat-not-burn technology is a better product than combustible cigarette. I think that it's very, very important confirmation. And it really should put the focus on how we make this better alternative for the smoker as fast as possible, I would say, and in the broadest possible geographies and that's really what it means. So we think that as the FDA is recognized as a very highly regarded regulator, as they are coming from me with the right approach, where they are both dealing with review of reducing arms on tobacco-product and at the same time, the continued restriction on tobacco usage, we think that this is the right approach that we are going to be able to, I would say, share with other regulator and we are hopeful that, of course, people will look at this decision and will draw conclusion on that. Let's be clear, we already have this type of decision with several regulatory in the world. So we think it's just going to amplify that. And we are beyond the U.S., where now we have the authorization to market as a reduce exposure. We are already in other country communicating on that reduce exposure of our IQOS product. So it's going in the right direction to, I think, really define what should be the right priorities, and hopefully, it's going to accelerate things globally. Thank you. Hi, Robert. If I understand well your question, you're asking what we should think about Indonesia beyond the COVID crisis and what we should understand. So, let's be clear, you have really two dimension that we need to explain on the situation in Indonesia. Well, the first one, of course, is everything related to the COVID crisis. To start with, remember that we started the year before the COVID crisis flagging the fact that Indonesia would be difficult in 2020. There was a double, I would say excise duty increase at the beginning of the year. We have been leading the price positioning in the market for quite a while in Indonesia and we have not been increasing price at the end of 2019. So, that's what's creating difficulty and we were saying that this difficulty would last until the minimum retail selling price is implemented. Then the COVID crisis started, and obviously, that has been creating a total disruption of the market. We have seen what we have seen in other new economy with impact on the consumption driven by daily wage worker, reducing their daily average consumption. I mean, is it 20%, 30%? Difficult to define. But that has been impacting, and as we flagged, it has been probably more impactful in urban areas than in the countryside. We have seen some down-trading as there were some pressure on purchasing power and there has been also in the regions of market some evolution to well certain category where we have a lower representation again in line with down-trading. On top of that there was this second-tier system on the excise duty due to or corresponding to low volume or supposed to be low volume company that are benefiting from a much lower excise duty and which can generate a price differential of 40% to 50% versus the Tier 1 system. So it's very substantial. We talk about a market where this cigarette of the second tier system can enjoy a significantly lower price. And, of course, at the time of down-trading consumer has been looking for cheaper alternative, and this market was supposed to stay at a very low level because this was supposed to only be granted to very small level of production. There has been some abuse on the way this has been played, and this second tier category has reached in Q2 25% of the market, which as you can imagine on something which was based on reduced volume was not at all the intention, and that has further disrupted the market. Now when we see these various headwinds that we have been facing, what can we expect? Well, first of all, regarding the minimum retail selling price implementation, it has now started. It's going to be implemented through Q3, but we don't expect really to impact in Q3, and therefore, we can expect to see the benefit of that in Q4. So that's going to be a first element that is going to improve the situation. Second, we are, of course, being active in trying to make sure that we developed our brands and we launched offer in the most dynamic part of the market, and I've been referring to Dji Sam Soe and Marlboro on which we are launching extension in dynamic part of the market. We expect globally as the COVID crisis pass and we know that next year people, economists are expecting a strong rebound of the Indonesian economy, so we expect globally also the pressure on down-trading to reduce as the economy is improving; the daily consumption to also improve, so that should help the trend. And last element that, of course, we don't control is this second tier category where we will need and we think is going to happen because otherwise, it's going to massively decrease the income of the country, but there is a need for reform to limit the benefit or change the structure of the excise duty depending on the values category. Well, at the end of the day to create level playing field and for all players to be playing on the kind of equal basis and we are certainly hoping that it's going to impact -- is going to arrive as soon as possible. If everything that I've just been described -- describing happen, well, there is no reason why we cannot rebound in Indonesia and be back to our market share that we experienced in the past years. Our brands are extremely strong. We have an incredible commercial machine in the country, and all that are, of course, the strengths on which we will build our rebound in the coming quarters. Thank you. Yes. What we flagged is that down-trading may have accelerated in a few countries where it was probably already visible before the crisis started, so we talk about Turkey, we could talk about Mexico. These are typically in addition with Indonesia. These are the markets where we have seen I would say increased pressure on purchasing power triggering down-trading. Now for the future, of course, nobody knows what's going to be the impact of the economic crisis that everybody is forecasting. We've been there before, so that will not be the first time that we are managing a very tough environment and we have shown in the past that we have an absolute capacity to manage this kind of environment with the agility, with the headroom and with the levers to manage this kind of environment. So we would see and we will adapt to the situation. Thank you. Sure, Michael. So, probably, Japan is at the forefront of what you can expect in many countries as it get more mature, I would say, on the growth of the heat-not-burn and IQOS. I think it makes sense to have several offering for the customers. And in Japan, I think, probably, my first comment will be on the fact that the market did perform well. Clearly, in H1 and in Q2, we have been growing double-digit our shipments and end-market sales in Japan in Q2 for heat-not-burn globally. So as you can see, it's a market that continue to grow very nicely, and certainly, HEETS has been a contributor to that. So the fact that we are playing with both Marlboro and HEETS enable us to really capture maximum opportunity in the market. And we see a very, very positive trend on HEETS, which has captured close to 4% of the market. So you see that it's already a sizable part of our RRP business in Japan, and that bodes very well for what we can do with two brands in the country. No. What is taken in the guidance is essentially that we should have a large part of the benefit in Q4. So, we're not expecting anything in Q3, but we think a large part of the benefit of having minimum retail selling price should be seen in Q4. Yes. So -- you're absolutely right Michael. So the good news is that we had the right level of inventory before this ban happened. So we are not facing out of stock situation. So, of course, we hope it is not going to last too much because we are not saying that we have some devices or inventory for several years, but for the time being, it's not an issue. We are hopeful that Mexico is going to look at the FDA decision and that will influence their decision on [indiscernible]. But it's -- as you know, it's not targeted to IQOS. So we're just unfortunately here the [indiscernible] of a broader decision, if I may say. Hopefully, they will come back on that one rapidly and that will allow us to resume the export to Mexico of devices. Thank you. Yes. No, I understand, Adam. Thank you for the question. Well, let's face the reality of number, it's not $0.20 because what we are saying is that we have, I would say, a big half of the $0.20, as you said, that is coming from one-off factor that's going to be compensated in Q3. So it's not as if we had missed the landing, it's just that the number of fact that we could not anticipate at the beginning of June happened at the end of June and that helped the landing of Q2. Now, you're right, there is approximately $0.08 to $0.09 that we deliver above the anticipation at the beginning of June and I would say, that's -- I mean, the month of June has been very important, because in fact, we all realize that all the lockdown and the confinement last until beginning of June when things were gradually released in many, many geographies, and even if there was still a number of disruption, I think that when we look, for instance, like people not all being back to work physically, I think that we don't know when all that is going to be back to normal. So, let's assume that June was probably giving us a pretty good visibility on what we could expect for the coming months. And that's really on the basis of that that we have come to this capacity to come with this vision and guidance for the full year. So again, June has been important, the learning of June has been important and the miss has not been $0.20 but rather $0.10, and of course, the first weeks of July, as we've been saying, is confirming this kind of understanding of the environment in which we are for the time being. Well, and I'm of course you know I've broken my crystal ball, so I'm not able to tell you whether this kind of thing could happen. I think we're coming with a carefully considered range for the landing with a number of scenarios behind it and I think that's encapsulating several possibility and pluses and minus, as always, when you build a guidance, and we think that this is at that stage. With all the information that we have, the right guidance and the right vision for the landing, and I'm not able to say more. If there are things that we haven't been anticipating in our various scenarios that happen, that can always happen, of course, and the last months are here to remind us that we are not able to anticipate everything, well, we'll see. But for the time being, with again all the information that we have, the June till mid-July vision, we think that this is the right guidance for the end of the year. No, it is, Adam and it's a very fair question. Let me be start by reminding what is the model of IQOS and RRPs. It starts with the consumable that are, as you know, enjoying today higher value on the per stick basis, okay, which is absolutely intrinsic to this RRP business and that's a business on which as well versus CC, we are also improving the way we are producing, improving productivity, and therefore, when you look at the gross margin on the HTUs, there is some positive -- so we're starting from, of course, this favorable situation that I described and there is a possibility of, I would say, a positive evolution. Then, you have the devices, okay, which we've seen is a small percentage of the total, but it's a material one. And on this one, I think, we've been clear on the fact that the margin by type of device can be different, but we can accept to sometime not make money or in some condition even lose some money, because at the end of the day, it's part of the investment that we make to acquire new customers. So that's the starting point. And then below that, of course, you have the old machine to acquire in order to convert smokers to IQOS and then to retain. And on that machine as well, we're going to improve things as we are growing the top line on RRPs. We are gaining in efficiency, we use more digital, we said it, and we are, I would say, polishing the machine, increasing at the same time the strength of the engine, but also, I would say, reducing the cost of the engine. So, that's going to keep playing positively. So, I don't know whether I should take impressive and I don't know what you put behind impressive, but you should certainly expect us to keep growing the margin on the RRPs gradually in a meaningful manner as we continue to grow on IQOS and RRPs. That's certainly our objective. Adam, I won't comment on that, whether it's going to be above, below. What I can tell you is that we believe that we have some significant headroom to keep improving margin, but I won't comment further. Okay, thank you. Well, I think that, you're right that you have the two drivers behind Marlboro and that has been -- Q2 has been a difficult quarter for Marlboro, has been losing some share both because of, you said it down-trading, and it's few markets where we can see that, but also I think to a large extent in many markets where Marlboro has a big market share because of the social movement that have almost entirely disappeared during Q2. And at the same time, by the way, you have market such as the Philippines, where Marlboro has been growing nicely as well. So, it's a mixed picture, I would say. It's not one direction and it's a bit more complex than that. But we are certainly confident that Marlboro is going to be able to rebound nicely first with everything around the social consumption, and we are going to certainly see some rebound as well even in countries, where we have seen down-trading during the period when the COVID crisis hopefully ease. When it comes to the down-trading, is it really Marlboro downward or more mid to low? So, I think even the real impact of, and I was talking about Philippines, which has been a market where the conversation has been difficult and despite that we've seen good evolution for Marlboro. I think Marlboro has been getting 3 points of market share in the quarter. So, it's quite good. So, I would say, when we talk about down-trading, I'm not sure that this has been the main impact on Marlboro, but rather again, down-trading is rather mid-pricing going to lower pricing, and the biggest impact on Marlboro we see is this absence of social moment where Marlboro is an important brand. So, we hope that will enable a good and fast rebound for the brand. Well, Vivien, I'm not sure that we have any information that would clearly point to that. We know that Q2 has been impacted globally in the tobacco market by a lot of disruption that has been potentially influencing the daily consumption and that maybe in some markets, it can have an impact on few markets for IQOS, but frankly, we have no data and nothing pointing to that based on all the data that we have on Q2. Thank you. Yes, thank you for the question. So, as a general rule, yes, we are passing on this tax evolution whether on excise duty or VAT, that's a general rule. But maybe more important is the comment on what we can expect for the coming quarters in term of evolution of the tax environment. Well, it is true and that's certainly the sense behind your question that many countries are going to face higher deficit -- budget deficit because of the crisis and the temptation could be there to try to find way to finance it. First of all, this type of decision is usually made in the fourth quarter of the year. So, probably end of the Q3, beginning of Q4. So we know more at the time. But I have the feeling that versus maybe what happened in 2008-2009, here, the environment is quite different and many governments are rather trying not to depress the consumption and you know that when you increase price, at the end of the day, you're not too sure about the net impact you're going to get on your -- on the money that you're going to receive. And therefore, it remains to be seen what's going to be the decision in term of tax increase of all nature. I think it's not clear. Well, if it was the case, as I said, we've seen that in the past in 2008/2009 as -- again, there is probably a different way to approach the crisis, as seen a lot of excise duty increase in many countries and I think we've shown our capacity to, of course, weather this kind of environment, and I would say, overcome this kind of headwind and we have no doubt that if it was the case, we would do that again. But, and I reiterate my but, it could be quite different this time and that is at least what we are hearing from a number of politicians and governments. Well, sure. I should probably be back to what we've been sharing about our expectation for Q3. So, we are, as we said in June and first weeks of July, seeing a kind of gradual improvement of the market, the global lockdown are over. We -- doesn't mean that we are back to normal, but as I said, we start to see the market operating maybe in a more consistent manner and with a bit less disruption. So, that is a trend that we've been flagging on June, but -- so that is why we are saying that we expect for Q3, net revenue that will be in sequential improvement versus Q2. So, that's exactly what is behind our vision for the rest of the year. It doesn't mean that we're going to be back on the growth year-on-year, and also, of course, in addition to that, we have some negative impact coming from H1 that's going to play on the top line and we said about 1% in Q3, but we are going to continue to see in Q3 some year-on-year negative evolution because lot of market remain extremely disrupted, and of course, I've been talking about Duty Free, Indonesia, but many other markets are going to be disrupted because of the COVID crisis, because of the restriction, because of potentially some impact on the economy. So, all that is going to play and impact us. I'm not going to enter into trajectory by market, but certainly we would expect the mature economy and that's probably what we've seen in -- at the end of the quarter to show some good resilience in this environment and maybe less disruption versus a new economy. That would be in the ballpark our feeling. And then, if we enter Q4, as we said, we continue to expect an improvement on net revenue for Q4 versus Q2 -- Q3, so sequentially, we're going to keep improving the net revenue number, but nevertheless, Q4 could still be negative year-on-year. And so, we really have to make the difference between the quarter-on-quarter trend, the sequential trend and then the year-on-year comparison. Well, IQOS has been doing very well in Russia in Q2 in this environment. So it's, of course, I cannot say that there was no impact from the disruption, some lockdown in Russia, but we continue to grow share for IQOS and we are pleased with the evolution of our RRP in this market. Altogether, the Russian market has probably been impacted but in a minor way by the evolution. So, when you look at the volume, it was down, it was not with a strong acceleration in the underlying decline in volume that we have seen in Q2. So, that's a market that has resisted pretty well through this COVID crisis, and again, we are very pleased with the IQOS development. I'm not going to elaborate on what is going to be the trend in the next two quarters. We expect the IQOS market share to keep growing and that we're going to continue to perform well on IQOS. The good news is that we also maintain market share in CC at the same time. So, that was a nice achievement. Thank you. Well, yes, indeed we have seen in June, with the end of the lockdown in many countries, an improvement of the trend. I would say IQOS has been doing well, as we said, through the quarter. So, of course, we've seen some acceleration in June, but the whole quarter has been good for IQOS, and clearly, we have seen some acceleration in the CC business, which has been quite impacted by the lockdown in some geographies and we've seen some improvement in June. All markets are not being equal, and notably, the markets that are impacted by lower tourism have been more penalized and I talk about Southern Europe here. Of course, the markets typically see a lot of purchase being made abroad and a lot of cross-border activity with the border being closed. I mean, they've been globally doing better through the quarter. So, this is a kind of trend that we have seen in Europe. Thank you. Thank you all. Talk to you soon. Thanks. Bye."

Today\u2019s call is scheduled to last about one hour including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community.I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.\nNick Rolli: Welcome. And thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2020 first quarter results. You may access the release on www.pmi.com or the PMI Investor Relations app.A glossary of terms, including the definition for reduced-risk products, or RRPs, as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures, additional heated tobacco unit market data and our business transformation metrics are at the end of today\u2019s webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Unless otherwise stated, all references to IQOS are to our IQOS heat-not-burn products.Comparisons are presented on a like-for-like basis reflecting pro forma 2019 results, which have been adjusted for the deconsolidation of our Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges, Inc., effective March 22, 2019.Today\u2019s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today\u2019s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. Please note we now also include additional forward-looking and cautionary statements related to COVID-19.It\u2019s now my pleasure to introduce Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos, our Chief Executive Officer and Martin King, our Chief Financial Officer, both of whom will be available for the question-and-answer session. Andr\u00e9?\nAndr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos: Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. These are unprecedented times for all of us, and I hope everyone listening, and their families, are safe and well. I would also like to express our deep appreciation for the life-saving efforts of medical, social and other frontline workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.Our main focus at this time is on the health and wellbeing of our employees, their families and the communities in which we operate. We have implemented stringent policies and measures to minimize risks for those who continue to work in our facilities and offices.For all our employees, including those working from home, providing guidance and support is also essential. We recently announced a new set of guiding principles to reassure employees of the Company\u2019s commitment to job security throughout the global pandemic period in three areas: Employment stability; financial stability; and special recognition.The strength and spirit shown in these challenging times by the people that make up our organization is a real inspiration to me and the Philip Morris International management team, and I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank them for their outstanding efforts.Indeed, our people continue to generate ideas on how they and PMI can contribute skills and resources to the wider societal effort. Ongoing and planned initiatives in more than 60 countries include providing protective equipment to our trade partners, support to care communities, procurement support to purchase items essential to fight against COVID-19, and financial support to institutions and non-government organizations working to end this crisis. In addition, our employees in many countries are volunteering to help elderly, low-income, and other at-risk populations, and some of our factories are producing hand sanitizer and masks for their local communities. Lastly, but very importantly, we have also taken steps to ensure the continuity of supply to our customers and consumers, and to support our suppliers through these challenging times.Let me now comment on the overall impact of COVID-19 on our business and outlook before I hand over to Martin, who will cover this impact and the performance in the quarter in more detail.We started the year with a very strong first quarter, with minimal disruption to business performance and continued structural growth momentum. While we have had a number of temporary shutdowns at different manufacturing facilities and some additional complexities in our route-to-market, we have activated contingency plans, where required, to ensure sufficient inventories and consumer access to our products. Allied to a healthy balance sheet and liquidity position, our ability to generate cash will allow us to continue investing in our business, retire maturing debt and pay dividends.Turning to the outlook. The inherent uncertainty in the global economic picture makes forecasting much more challenging than usual. With social isolation measures placing day-to-day life on hold for much of the world\u2019s population, this temporarily impacts our operating environment. The most direct effect is on Duty-Free sales due to reduced travel, with additional impacts from delayed IQOS user acquisition and regulatory price enforcement in Indonesia. In total, this is likely to have a negative impact on our 2020 currency-neutral performance, with recent exchange rate movements a further drag.As visibility on the duration and extent of lockdown measures across the world is extremely limited, we are withdrawing our annual forecast and replacing it with quarterly guidance, where visibility is relatively better. Martin will talk through the key moving parts, and our EPS guidance for the second quarter, when the most impact is likely to be felt.We are confident the strong momentum on IQOS user acquisition shown in recent quarters will start to resume as restrictions ease. In the meantime, our digital and commercial engine allows us to serve our existing adult consumers, maximize the conversion of adult smokers under the prevailing circumstances, and tailor our investments as required to optimize costs.There is also considerable uncertainty as to the magnitude of the economic consequences of the current situation and the speed and shape of the recovery, including the impacts on disposable incomes and unemployment. While it is too early to fully assess potential effects on market dynamics in terms of consumption and down-trading, we have to assume there will be some impact. We also sense, in certain developing countries, difficulties in ensuring business continuity for some smaller general trade players, which may lead to localized out-of-stocks. However, as in previous times of economic and social turbulence, we expect to show resilient performance through these challenges. Martin?\nMartin King: Thank you, Andr\u00e9.I\u2019ll start with a headline summary of our first quarter performance, which was very strong in terms of like-for-like ex-currency growth before any pandemic impact. We estimate COVID-19 effects, primarily distributor and trade inventory movements, accounted for 2 points of net revenue growth, 110 basis points of adjusted operating income margin and 6.8 points of adjusted diluted earnings per share growth.Heated tobacco unit shipment volume grew 45% to 16.7 billion units, reflecting continued broad-based share gains. Total combined shipment volume decreased by a modest 0.6% on a like-for-like basis, benefiting from inventory movements. Currency-neutral net revenues grew by 10%, reflecting the volume growth and positive geographic mix of HTUs, in addition to a strong combustible tobacco pricing variance of 7.7%. This robust revenue growth, combined with a positive margin mix, scale effects of higher HTU volumes, cost efficiencies and cost phasing drove a 510 basis-point increase in our adjusted currency-neutral operating income margin, and30.1% growth in currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS.This excellent start to the year, with encouraging progress in both our combustible and reduced-risk product businesses, is particularly important as we consider the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.While we expect our core existing operations to continue performing well, there are three main areas of expected impact from temporary changes to our operating environment, in addition to the impact of currency movements, which I\u2019ll come back to. The first, and likely longest in duration, is on Duty-Free sales, due to severely curtailed global travel. For context, PMI Duty-Free, with a market share of 37%, contributed almost 4% of our 2019 net revenues. It also enjoys higher unit margins relative to the global average, given the skew to premium brands such as Marlboro and HEETS. Consumer offtake trends exited March with declines of over 80%, and we expect similar trends to continue until travel starts to recover.Due to the premium skew of our Duty-Free sales, we assume that only a portion of the volume will be recovered by our own brand portfolio in local markets, usually at lower margins.The second impact is on the rate of IQOS user acquisition. Lockdown measures and other restrictions hamper our ability to engage adult smokers. Our IQOS retail touch-points are currently closed in a number of markets, and even where open, retail footfall is significantly down. Our investments in digital capabilities over recent quarters are now coming into their own, and we are reallocating further commercial spend to digital where required. Our commercial sales experts and coaches, although very limited in terms of physical consumer engagement, have a number of tools at their disposal to conduct virtual guided trials. However, based on trends since lockdown measures were introduced, we expect our rate of user acquisition to be on average around 50% lower than previously anticipated, for as long as widespread restrictions continue. Variations by country also make the mix difficult to project. To be clear, we believe this is delayed rather than lost growth and we expect the strong underlying momentum witnessed in recent quarters to pick up as restrictions ease. Importantly, given our digital capabilities, we do not expect customer retention or conversion rates to be affected.For illustrative purposes, each 1 million users acquired have an annualized consumption of around 5 billion heated tobacco units and, using pre-COVID market mix including device sales and cannibalization effects, would generate on average over $350 million in net revenues and over $200 million in incremental contribution.We are also able to flex our commercial initiatives, and accordingly the timing of plans for IQOS VEEV, our improved e-vapor product, and the licensed KT&G products later this year could be delayed depending on how events unfold.The last main area of impact is in Indonesia. As explained previously, 2020 was already a year of catch-up on excise tax and pricing. A positive structural element of the new excise tax was a larger percentage increase at the mid-to-low segment of the market, with a new minimum retail selling price due to come into effect on April 1st. However, the government has now said the enforcement of the new minimum price is delayed until June, due to COVID-19 restrictions. The prolonging of unfavorable price gaps is an added headwind for the risk of down-trading, the timing of price increases and for our market share.While the effects of pandemic-related measures on our operating environment, such as travel restrictions, are tangible, there is greater uncertainty as to the social and economic impact on consumer purchasing behavior during the crisis.In developed markets, like the EU region or Japan, which tend to have strong social support programs, we have so far observed only a limited impact. There have been instances of pantry-loading in certain markets around the introduction of restrictions. However, these have been generally short-lived in nature and had a minimal impact on Q1 performance, with distributor and trade inventory movements being the bigger influence.In certain developing markets, the high prevalence of daily wage workers, lower resources for social support and thus greater fragility of incomes create more vulnerability. We observe some initial signs of down-trading and reduced daily consumption in some countries. The most significant for us are Indonesia and the Philippines, the latter of which has the added dynamic of being a stick market. We have to assume these trends will temporarily continue while pandemic-driven restrictions last.As Andr\u00e9 mentioned, given less developed route-to-market infrastructure, we also sense potential difficulties in certain emerging markets for some smaller general trade outlets, which may lead to temporary localized out-of-stocks.Our own manufacturing and distribution operations continue to function well despite current challenges. This is made possible by the incredible efforts of our supply chain and market teams, who have implemented a number of contingency measures with regard to production and customer supply. On average, inventories of our products remain healthy, with over two months for heated tobacco units, over three months on IQOS devices and over one and a half months for cigarettes, including distributors.After the one week suspension of production at our Bologna HTU facility in late March, all our HTU factories are currently operating with sufficient capacity. Around 20% of our cigarette production capacity is currently affected by temporary shutdowns. However, we do not currently foresee any out-of-stocks in major operating income markets. One watch-out is Argentina, where we will be facing out-of-stocks if the factory does not reopen soon.Given investor focus on the liquidity of listed companies in the current environment, I want to highlight our robust position. We continue to have ample liquidity sources through the ongoing cash generation of our business, cash on hand and access to commercial paper. Our $7.5 billion revolving credit facility remains undrawn.Our balance sheet remains strong with a well-laddered bond portfolio and net debt of 1.9 times adjusted EBITDA as of March 31, 2020. We repaid $3.6 billion of maturing bonds during the first quarter and distributed a total of $3.6 billion in dividends to shareholders in January and April.We also expect that strong cash flows will exceed cash requirements, including the funding of dividends, to which we remain fully committed. Our ability to invest appropriately in our business and retire debt is fully intact. However, further deleveraging of our balance sheet, at prevailing exchange rates, may be somewhat delayed versus our previous expectations.It\u2019s also worth mentioning that our cost efficiency programs continue, and that we remain well on track to deliver over $1 billion in efficiencies by 2021. These programs are also flexible, and we are reprioritizing activities as events unfold. Related to this, we expect to reduce capital expenditures to approximately $0.8 billion for the year, with the reduction unrelated to RRP investments.We turn now to guidance. As covered in our earnings release, we have withdrawn our previous reported diluted full-year 2020 EPS forecast of at least $5.50, which absent COVID-19, our business was well on track to deliver. However, as we stand today, there is simply not enough visibility on the duration or extent of lockdown and social isolation measures, and their wider consequences, to provide a sufficiently reliable full-year earnings estimate. Given comparatively better short-term visibility, we are therefore introducing quarterly guidance, one quarter forward, in its place.As previously flagged, we already expected a weak second quarter, notably due to an unfavorable prior year comparison, market dynamics in Indonesia, and cost phasing. We also expect the biggest quarterly impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business to occur in the period, which we additionally factor in.Consequently, we expect Q2 2020 reported diluted EPS to be in a range of $1 to $1.10. This forecast assumes unfavorable impacts of $0.12 for currency, at prevailing rates, reflecting the devaluation of many of our operating currencies vis-\u00e0-vis the U.S. dollar, notably including the Russian ruble, Indonesian rupiah and Mexican peso; $0.10 for inventory movements, primarily reversals from the first quarter; $0.09 for lost Duty-Free sales, net of domestic sales recapture, assuming no recovery in global travel in the period; and $0.05 to $0.15 for the delay in Indonesia minimum price enforcement and other COVID-19 related factors, including temporary reductions in daily consumption and down-trading in certain developing markets. These assumptions also reflect ex-currency net revenue declines of approximately 8% to 12%, with the expected decline being wholly attributable to COVID-19 related impacts, including on device sales.Let me now run through some of the main elements of our first quarter performance. We estimate the total international industry declined 2.9% in the period. However, we recorded a total like-for-like shipment volume decline of only 0.6%, with cigarette declines of 3.8%, largely offset by the impressive 45.5% growth of heated tobacco units, with notable contributions from the EU region, Japan and Russia.Excluding the net favorable impact of estimated distributor inventory movements, our total in-market sales volume declined by 3.7%. Inventory movements reflect two main factors: Firstly, the prior year comparison where shipment volumes in Q1, 2019 were below in-market sales; and secondly, net distributor inventory build-up in Q1 2020 to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 related disruption.Importantly, our HTU in-market sales volume increased by 3.9% sequentially versus the fourth quarter, reaching over 17 billion units in what is typically the lowest volume quarter of the year. This strong performance means that heated tobacco units now make up nearly 10% of our total shipment volume, as compared to 8% in 2019, and almost nothing in 2015. We expect this proportion to grow further as our positive momentum on RRPs continues.Turning to our financial results. Net revenues increased by 10% excluding currency, driven by pricing in combustibles, a favorable comparison versus Q1 2019 and growth in heated tobacco units. We estimate the COVID-19 effect of higher trade inventories and, to a lesser extent, consumer pantry-loading contributed around one-fifth of the growth in net revenues, operating income and EPS.We recorded a strong combustible tobacco pricing variance of 7.7%, with no significant impact of COVID-19 and notable contributions from the GCC, Germany, Mexico, the Philippines, Russia and Turkey.Adjusted operating income increased by 25.5% ex-currency, while currency-neutral adjusted operating income margin grew by an excellent 510 basis points. This strong margin expansion was driven by RRP scale effects and favorable geographic mix for HTUs. Additional drivers include pricing in combustibles, cost phasing and the underlying impact of cost initiatives.Adjusted diluted EPS increased strongly, growing by 30.1% excluding currency. With regard to currency, we should point out that the unfavorable impact of $0.13 in the first quarter includes $0.07 of transactional impact occurred in March, primarily from the revaluation of euro or dollar denominated payables in certain markets, such as Russia, where the local currency has seen a significant devaluation. Such effects would only recur in future quarters if further sharp devaluations took place.RRP net revenues reached $1.6 billion, or close to 22% of PMI\u2019s total net revenues, with IQOS devices accounting for approximately 10% of RRP net revenues.Turning now to market share. Our total international share was slightly lower to 27.9%, with higher share for heated tobacco units, which reached 2.9%, offset by lower share for cigarettes. The share of our cigarette portfolio declined by 1.1 points reflecting continued adult smoker out-switching to IQOS and lower share notably in Argentina and Indonesia, due to price gaps with tax-advantaged local competitors, trade inventory movements in Pakistan and an unfavorable prior year comparison in Turkey.Let\u2019s turn to Indonesia, where industry volumes declined by only 0.6% in the first quarter due to trade loading effects, which are likely to reverse in the second quarter. Pricing was taken on all main premium and mid-price brands, with PMI price increases since October of 2019 representing approximately 85% of the weighted-average pass-on of the 2020 excise increase. Our share declined, despite a recovery in premium A Mild due to smaller price gaps with directly competitive brands. These gains were outweighed by our mid and low-priced brands, which lost share to super-low price manufacturers who are tax advantaged due to smaller scale.It follows that the delay in the enforcement of the minimum selling price extends this temporary share headwind. The prevalence of daily wage workers in Indonesia also introduces some uncertainty as to the effects of social restrictions on daily consumption. As such, we have to assume the total market decline will be higher than our previous estimate of 6% to 7%.Turning now to RRP performance. We estimate that there were 14.6 million total IQOS users as of March 31st, representing the addition of more than 4 million adult users since the same time last year. We further estimate that 73% of this total or 10.6 million IQOS users have stopped smoking and switched to IQOS, with the balance in various stages of conversion. This reflects widespread user growth momentum across all key IQOS geographies, including Japan, Russia and the EU.The overall share performance of IQOS HTUs continues to see excellent progress. Indeed, in international markets where IQOS has been commercialized, IQOS HTUs were again the third-largest tobacco brand in the first quarter with 6.6% share, increasing from 5.5% in Q4 2019. This was achieved despite not having full national distribution in a number of markets.In the EU region, first-quarter share for HEETS reached 3.9% of total industry volume, with an estimated 0.2 points due to consumer pantry-loading. On a sequential basis, share growth was also very strong, increasing by 0.7 points, with in-market sales volume 13% higher compared to Q4 2019, despite a typically lower quarter. I also refer you to the appendix where we show shares by key EU market and global key cities.IQOS continued its strong performance in Russia, with HEETS share up by 3.5 points to reach 6.5%. On a sequential basis versus the fourth quarter of 2019, HEETS share increased by 1.5 points, while in-market sales increased by 3%. With limited social restrictions in Russia in the period, there was minimal estimated impact of pantry-loading.In Japan, our total reported share for heated tobacco units increased by 2.1 points to reach 19.1% in the first quarter, supported by the launch of IQOS 3 DUO and line extensions in our Marlboro HeatSticks and HEETS line-ups.On an adjusted total tobacco view including cigarillos and adjusted for trade inventory movements, the share of our HTU brands increased by 1.1 points versus the prior year quarter, and by 0.6 points sequentially, to 17.7%.Q1 2020 adjusted in-market sales volumes for our HTU brands grew 6.2% compared to an adjusted total tobacco market which declined by around 1%. This helped drive growth of the overall heated tobacco category to a first-quarter total tobacco share of over 24%.Lastly, following the 2019 launch of IQOS in the U.S. through our commercial arrangement with Altria, in March, we submitted a supplemental PMTA for the IQOS 3 device to the FDA to further support the efforts to convert U.S. adult consumers who would otherwise continue to smoke. FDA\u2019s review of the Company\u2019s Modified Risk Tobacco Product applications for the IQOS tobacco heating system, which is separate from this PMTA application, continues.Let me now hand back to Andr\u00e9 for closing remarks. Andr\u00e9?\nAndr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos: Thank you, Martin.In summary, the continued strong underlying momentum in our business, especially the impressive growth of reduced-risk products, is again evident in our first quarter results.The world has clearly now changed, with considerable uncertainty as to the development and duration of the pandemic and its economic and social consequences, including those which impact our operating environment and our consumers.Our business has historically proven remarkably resilient, and we believe we can deliver a solid performance under the current challenging circumstances. Importantly, we remain confident in our structural mid-term growth prospects and, when these headwinds have passed, expect to resume growth consistent with our 2019 to 2021 compound annual ex-currency growth targets of at least 5% net revenue growth and at least 8% adjusted earnings per share growth.Crucially, our organization, liquidity and balance sheet are strong. We will continue to protect and support our employees, serve our consumers and reward our shareholders, which clearly includes our strong commitment to our dividend.We remain resolute in our strategy for a smoke-free future and are convinced that we\u2019ll emerge stronger from this crisis.Thank you. Martin and I are happy now to answer your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Pamela Kaufman of Morgan Stanley.\nPamela Kaufman: Hi. Thank you for the question, and I hope you are all doing well.\nAndr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos: Hi, Pam.\nPamela Kaufman: Hi. I was hoping to get an update on where you\u2019re seeing the most significant impact on new IQOS user growth in 2020. And is there any markets that are surprising you in terms of the resilience of IQOS performance in the current backdrop? And then, separately, are you seeing a negative impact on IQOS usage among existing users?\nAndr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos: Okay. Let me take a minute to give some context here on what we\u2019re going to discuss during the call. Okay? The first thing is that we do not see any structural business fundamentals kind of problem. It\u2019s more delays, slowdowns, as you mentioned, in the acquisition, and one-offs during the duration of the pandemic. The second thing, we have assumed that in this quarter, because that\u2019s where we can see, we\u2019ll have lockdowns continuing essentially through the end of April and the vast part of May with some gradual recovery during the month of June, and then it continues. Okay? So, that\u2019s important to remember when we discuss the context.So, what we observe with a high degree of certainty is that Duty-Free impact because there\u2019s no traveling essentially worldwide.The second thing we\u2019ve seen to your point, Pam, is a slowdown in the acquisition of IQOS. That varies market to market obviously because some have stricter restrictions and others much less. So, we have big differences I would say between Japan, who are almost operating with normality with some slowdown and Europe, where we have more slowdown as physically our coaches cannot engage with people and our stores are closed today. So, that\u2019s why I\u2019m saying on average we are around 50%, sometimes higher. Okay? So, I find this, given the circumstances are that the people are confined at home to be very resilient actually, especially since as I said, stores are closed and the coaches cannot physically interact with people, and that\u2019s the right thing to do.We see a much bigger increase -- a high sales through our digital channels. And as Martin said, we\u2019re gearing more and more resources from the other channels obviously to those. That\u2019s for acquisition.For retention, we don\u2019t see any problem. Actually in certain markets, we see people increasing average daily consumption and retention rate and some of dual use being reduced during this period. So, there is no issue from that perspective. And we don\u2019t have also an issue regarding the sales of IQOS, heat to tobacco unit in the market. So, I don\u2019t know if I answer your question.\nPamela Kaufman: Yes. Thank you.\nMartin King: I\u2019d just add to that. Pam, we\u2019re also not seeing any drop-off in conversion rates. Conversion rates, in fact, they\u2019re looking quite strong. So, the underlying business and retaining consumers and conversion consumer is going great. Obviously, your ability to have the face to face interaction has little bit slowed down, but we\u2019re switching as fast as we can to more digital channels.\nPamela Kaufman: Thanks. And then, how should we think about the balance between your planned cost savings realization for this year and the investments that you\u2019re making in the business to drive IQOS adoption? Are there delays in your cost savings plans? And I guess, how are you thinking about changes in timing of your investments and what you\u2019re investing behind?\nMartin King: The first principle that we\u2019ve undertaken is that our investments need to align in the new situation. In other words, we are, if anything, putting more money into those aspects which will help us recover momentum and get back to growth as soon as the lockdown ends. Hence the focus on where we can add some investment around digital and around the programs which will have a bigger impact later. But clearly, we\u2019ve gone through our projects as well to see which ones are hampered by our inability to operate right now and need to be retimed and move some of the spending further later in the year or even into the next year. And we\u2019ve also looked again at our list of projects to prioritize the ones that maybe had not as good a return and try to mitigate some of the impacts of what we\u2019re seeing from the COVID-related.So, overall, our cost savings are on track. If anything, we will accelerate some as we can. And then, our investments part is also lining up to the new situation and giving us the biggest bang for our buck. So, we are looking long term and looking towards the growth momentum that we can attain as we come out of this.\nPamela Kaufman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Spielman, Citi.\nAdam Spielman: Hello. Thank you very much. So, I have three questions, if I may. The first one is about illicit and cross border. So, I am a little bit surprised -- or rephrase it. I would have expected the clampdown on borders and transport to result in much reduced illicit figure adds and also legal cross border. And I would have thought that would be quite a positive impact in Q2 and Q3. But, you haven\u2019t mentioned it. So, I guess, am I wrong or is that a positive impact? How should we think about that? That\u2019s the first question.\nAndr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos: Okay. Again, Adam, some of these things we try to lay out are based on observations. And you\u2019re right. Our markets report some reduction in illicit trade for the reasons you mentioned. Now, we cannot cautiously take the European Union has 10% illicit trade and say this is going to all disappear and appear in the domestic market. So, we may see some, but -- and reasonably so. But, I\u2019m not sure we have taken this all in the number because we are just three weeks essentially in the month of April. And I prefer to remain a bit cautious. But you are right. We are observing this and we should see some impact.\nAdam Spielman: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Next question is on Indonesia. You -- obviously, the minimum price was going to be imposed on April 1st. You\u2019ve now talked about that being delayed till June, but I noticed you didn\u2019t give a specific date. Is it possible -- or how likely do you think it is that if it\u2019s delayed further -- if we see really quite a nasty recession in Indonesia?\nAndr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos: Well, I\u2019ll ask -- generally, what we know is the government said that because they cannot send inspectors out to inspect physically outlets because of the COVID, they have to delay and they gave a date. That is June. That\u2019s not any firm date in June. So, if they get out of a situation or restrictions earlier, I assume they will do it earlier. If it continues, it may continue a bit longer. That\u2019s why we have uncertainty in this whole as a matter of principle. Now, I don\u2019t know, if Martin you want to add something?\nMartin King: It\u2019s exactly right. It\u2019s a matter of when they can get out there and start inspecting. It\u2019s not a matter of not wanting to do it. It\u2019s purely for their issue with their inspectors.\nAndr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos: Now, in Indonesia, we have these, and obviously in Indonesia -- is in the category of these developing markets. Martin mentioned in his remarks and myself that we have a lot of casual -- or many people work on a daily salary essentially. And if they can\u2019t work, clearly their consumption has to adjust to the situation. So, we have to assume here that we may have some impact also on consumption coming from COVID. Other Southeast Asian markets can be impacted; Africa as well. So, we observe this phenomenon. And we had to make a forecast in our numbers of what that impact is going to be. You all appreciate it is rather difficult.And if I take, for example, a market we know very well, like the Philippines, this confinement clearly has some impact also in daily consumption. Also, it\u2019s a very broad trade with very small players, sometimes they run out-of-stock. And if we take markets with stick sales also, if we have an average stick sale -- an average consumption of sticks of or 9 per day, you go to 8 that\u2019s a 10%, 11% impact temporarily on the market. Now, how precise to be on this? I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s why we gave a broad range in these areas; I think some will happen. The people are not going to be immune to the confine. That\u2019s why we try to bake some numbers in. And I think it\u2019s reasonable to assume it at this stage. If it\u2019s better, it\u2019s better.Third question?\nAdam Spielman: Do you just -- following up on that Andr\u00e9. So, I hear people with -- I\u2019m not talking about Europe, which is obviously much more profitable for you. I hear people -- some people saying, people at home would smoke more, they\u2019re anxious, they\u2019re bored, they are not traveling that end up smoking more. And I hear other people saying they smoke less because they\u2019re concerned about the impact on possibly catching this disease. Do you have a view of sort of what individual consumption will do? I\u2019m thinking more developed markets than EMs now in the lockdown?\nAndr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos: Well, in the developed markets, we don\u2019t see any impact on consumption. You appreciate these early days and you don\u2019t have data on it, granular consumer research. But all of the elements you outlined are correct. Technically, people staying home have more opportunities than when they are in the offices for the people that work in offices. But, we don\u2019t -- should not forget in certain countries, you are with family and children. So, also you have to be a bit more respectful, so one may compensate the other. That\u2019s why we don\u2019t see any change in the pattern at this stage. But, we all need to appreciate guys that I think we\u2019ve been through many crisis and difficulties. But having people confined at home and not going out is not a situation we have ever faced. And some adjustments may happen in the daily consumption. I don\u2019t think that structure or anything else. We know that markets recover cigarettes after crisis, but this I have no experience to be very surgically precise.But everything you described is correct. And if we go to developed market -- developing market, I mean, we also saw in some countries, as I said, more IQOS used at home, okay, because people are more respectful of families and children and so on. So, that\u2019s where we are today in the developing markets, as I said. Okay. We also need to know, in some cultures, smoking in front of parents and some women may be less -- more reluctant to fully consume. That\u2019s compensated obviously, as you say, by some opportunities more. So, all-in-all, that\u2019s the best estimate we can make today. And I\u2019m trying to be as transparent as possible on what we know at this stage.\nAdam Spielman: Thank you very much. Final question, just very quickly. In the spirit of transparency, I know you\u2019re not giving EPS guidance for full year, but can you maybe say what the FX impact would be? I mean, should we just see the $0.13 in Q1 and $0.12 you\u2019ve guided to for Q2 and then put another two quarters of $0.12? Is that how should we -- should think about the FX for the full year on EPS?\nMartin King: Adam that\u2019s pretty close to Q2 estimate of $0.12. It will be roughly that in Q3 and Q4 at prevailing exchange rates, $0.11 to $0.12 something like that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.\nVivien Azer: Thank you for all the detailed commentary. I just wanted to double back to Andr\u00e9 some of your comments on down trading. Obviously, this is get a market by market commentary. But, I\u2019m just curious, in any market where you\u2019ve seen it pretty apparently. Has it happened faster than say like the last financial crisis or if it was an Asian market relative to a SARS or any other kind of market disruption that you\u2019ve seen? Thanks.\nAndr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos: Well, first of all, the only down-trading we can say we\u2019ve seen is the continuation of what\u2019s happening in Indonesia due to the price gaps. Okay? Here in my assumption that some may happen. Now, on one side, you say some people, if they have less disposable income for a period of time, and I\u2019m still referring to developing countries, they may down trade for a period of time. On the other side, we know in periods of uncertainty, especially the current one, people go for trusted brands from safe sources and they tend to trust the known brands. So, that\u2019s contradicting what I said previously and you need to find the right balance. That\u2019s the same thing is about illicit trade. It\u2019s not only availability of illicit trade, there is also no trust in the sources of illicit trade that may reduce it. Because there is this tendency to buy what is essential and what is trusted. So, I assume some down-trading. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019ve seen it. Okay?\nVivien Azer: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And as you think about kind of the quarter-to-quarter guidance, Martin, that you\u2019re going to be offering, implicit in there it seems like you guys are taking an appropriately conservative approach around volumes and changes in per capita consumption. Can you comment at all around the underlying assumptions around price elasticity embedded in your 2Q EPS guidance? Thanks.\nMartin King: Yes. I mean, when you look at the second quarter for example, we already had expected a pretty weak second quarter due to the dynamics out there on how we were wrapping pricing in Turkey for example where you had a big market gains before in the previous comparable periods against a 40% price increase that we\u2019ve had since then. We were looking at Mexico with the different timing on the price increase and the way the trade inventory we were working being a pretty big headwind. So, we already had looked at Indonesia. We knew that the big impact was coming in Q2. So, the Q2 guidance we\u2019re giving is actually if you unpick it, it\u2019s actually what we had expected before it\u2019s purely the COVID-related. We would have ended up without COVID after the first half being right on track with our full year numbers and hitting 9.5%, 10% EPS growth, right in with what we had thought we would end up for the full year.So, when you go forward and say what are we going to do for the rest of the year? We\u2019re going to basically be giving you each quarter one quarter ahead, what the COVID-related impacts are and trying to adjust to new news around lockdown timings and recoveries from consumers and so forth. And that\u2019s what we thought was more prudent, given that the underlying business is in fine shape or doing exactly what we thought. But it\u2019s very difficult to predict how this COVID-related piece is coming out. So, we can\u2019t really give you the full-year look right now, but we can give you each quarter ahead as best we predict what will happen given the latest news that we have.\nVivien Azer: Understood. And then, just a follow-up on that and then I\u2019ll drop back into queue. As you think about the COVID specific related impacts to 2Q, are you assuming a degradation in price elasticity just given some of the potential headwinds to the consumer, given unemployment rate?\nMartin King: No, we have some -- as Andr\u00e9 mentioned, we have some watch-outs in there, around average daily consumption, around down-trading in certain markets. But, it\u2019s not really a price elasticity point of view. As far as pricing goes -- price timing, we have to be cognizant that in the case of lockdowns and in certain periods, it may not be wise to take some of the pricing at exactly the same timing we had in the original plan. So, we will have to look at the timing of pricing in certain markets. In some markets, we will likely need to delay some planned pricing. On the other hand, we will look forward out into the year and see what we can do to try to compensate for that. So, it\u2019s more around timing of price increases that have to be rephased and rescheduled. And there may be -- likely will be some lower total pricing during the year than what we had originally planned just because you run out of runway, as you give up some of the windows due to the lockdowns, et cetera. You run out of runway to make up for some of the pricing that you will not be able to take over the next, say couple of weeks, months because of lockdown.\nAndr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos: I mean, all they are assumptions at this stage, but they\u2019re not relating to price elasticity, in my view. It\u2019s restating to do you go, and will governments allow that you take in one or two places a price increase in the middle of a crisis, I don\u2019t think psychologically from a consumer point of view is a right thing. So, these are a couple of months or a month delay. But in the vast majority of the places, we don\u2019t see any price elasticity in the short-term. Now, in the long run, I don\u2019t know what the impact of COVID is going to be on the world economy. But, if the world GDP comes down substantially for a longer period of time, you may need to revise elasticities. But as you know, in cigarettes, it is very rare that we need to revise elasticities, except in very big price increase.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gaurav Jain of Barclays.\nGaurav Jain: So, I have a couple of questions. So, one is just on your -- the supply chain and your factory footprint inventory levels. Do you think the current crisis changes the way you think on those issues long term?\nAndr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos: That\u2019s a very good question but doesn\u2019t only apply to us. Okay? I\u2019ve said it many times. Resilience equals a little bit of redundancy in the system in general. And thank God, we had inventories and we had action plans to obviously build inventory, so we saw the crisis arrive and materials and everything necessary to make it happen. Not sure that\u2019s the case for every business with just in time deliveries and trying to -- so, I think that would be a learning here for everybody.Now, as you know, in our business, as I said, we operate with fairly large inventories of tobacco, by the nature of the business, and we have the capability and the flexibility to build sufficient inventory. I think I don\u2019t see anything that we should revise at this stage on our footprint, given the fact also that in cigarettes, we are limited by trade blocks and input duties. So, we think it\u2019s rather optimal. But as a cautionary principle because I don\u2019t think COVID will disappear in one afternoon, it will come back, we have-to-have the caution that this may be repeated at the scale it was repeated this time because we were absolutely not ready as humanity for that. But we have to take our own conclusions of how build even more flexibility in the system. So far, I think we\u2019ve done pretty well. And you don\u2019t see what is behind the scenes on keeping everything flowing. I think, the guys in the Company have been miracles, given the circumstances.\nGaurav Jain: Sure. My next question is just on IQOS device pricing. Do you think the upfront pricing will become an issue to acquire new consumers in a recessionary environment?\nAndr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos: Well, I think, we can adjust the pricing obviously when necessary. My view is, pricing plays a role in the IQOS acquisition. But as I said many times, it\u2019s also a lot about convincing people to make the step. And sometimes pricing is the excuse. If you remember the remarks we made in February, the only place we can really see, they need both to have a tiered system in terms of device pricing. And at a certain stage in terms of consumables is Russia where in certain cities we\u2019re reaching really the limits of the premium consumer. And we are doing this with IQOS 2.4 plus being at the bottom end of our range, although more expensive than any other competitor. But as we always said, we maintain flexibility of this and we can adjust pretty rapidly once we recover business. Just now that\u2019s not our issue. Our issue is more the limited ability to have the contact with the consumers and the point of sale.\nGaurav Jain: Sure. And if I can just sneak in one last one. So, you have given this range of $0.05 to $0.15 EPS impact from the delay in minimum price enforcement in Indonesia and COVID-related cost including down-trading. So, should I read it that $0.05 is the impact from minimum price enforcement because that you have visibility on and the range -- the extra $0.10 range is because of issues around down-trading and other COVID cost because you don\u2019t have visibility of those?\nAndr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos: Well, I think we should look at this as one piece rather than trying to cap it because I don\u2019t have the super exact science in dissecting this. So it\u2019s an estimate. But, as I said, even if we look at the other numbers in there, even if I take inventories, we assumed in inventories that the buildup of safety stocks we\u2019ve done in certain countries, invest in the course of the month of March, will be fully paid back. Now, it may not happen, and we also have a reduction in inventories that we\u2019ve seen in certain countries and Duty-Free because retailers got a little bit worried about the situation, we will not recover them during the quarter.So, we\u2019ll put probably the worst scenario in there to be on the safe side. But, all these are flexible fixes. I can\u2019t predict them in time. So, we\u2019re trying, as I said, I repeat, to be as transparent as possible in this day, given the uncertainty. And I would stay there because me venturing any particular number, I can only be wrong.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.\nChris Growe: Guys, I hope you are well and glad to hear you\u2019re safe and healthy. I just had a question if I could, first of all. You\u2019ve seen some seasonality in your shipments between Q1 and 2Q and 3Q. And I\u2019m just curious how social distancing and isolation, those kind of things would affect that sort of seasonal lift you normally see in the second quarter. I guess, you mentioned that you\u2019re not seeing much of a change in daily consumption rates. Could that change going forward, if these social isolation moves are in place?\nAndr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos: Well, I mean, notoriously, the first quarter of the year is the lowest consumption quarter in every tobacco product. Okay? So, even if we look at the in-market sales for IQOS, we have to put them in this context by definition. Okay?\nChris Growe: Yes.\nAndr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos: And that\u2019s why in my view they\u2019re even better than somehow the numbers are in absolute terms. Okay?\nChris Growe: Sure.\nAndr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos: Now, what is going to happen in the second quarter, other than what I explained, I can\u2019t say, I -- we don\u2019t see in most of the markets any change in average daily consumption, except for the developing markets that have the specific things that I mentioned. We have not measured it. And it\u2019s very difficult, if I pick a market like Philippines. Okay? Yes, there is some sales decrease just now. It is possible that is part of the average daily consumption because it\u2019s a stick sales market, and people have less money. It\u2019s also possible that in some areas, we had some temporary out-of-stocks because it\u2019s a cash economy with a lot of retailers going to wholesalers to buy. And until the whole system recombines and starts working properly, it takes some time. So, I wouldn\u2019t attribute the lower sales, if you wish to, on the average daily consumption. But, I have to assume people that don\u2019t have a job for a period of time and they cannot have the daily salary, they will buy less for a period of time. And in my example, I said, okay, if average daily consumption is nine cigarettes in stick sales and you go to eight, it\u2019s a big difference for a month or for weeks. Okay? That\u2019s how I see it.Now, if we assume we come out of the crisis gradually as of June, we should see the situation coming back. Okay? And probably the economy that can recover faster in this casual economy because it will just -- the limitation of people to move and do business as usual, once that resumes, I assume, we\u2019ll recover it. Now, the question is temporary, as I said. And we don\u2019t know how temporary is temporary. It\u2019s not unlikely worldwide that we\u2019ll see an ease by government because now the health system starts getting to a point, they can handle an increase number of cases. But we may have another slowdown in six months. God knows. Okay? That\u2019s why we said, we give quarterly reviews. And as we advance, if we have any better data for the shareholders meeting that is forthcoming, we\u2019ll give you an update as well, we\u2019re learning as we speak.\nChris Growe: Sure.\nAndr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos: But, I don\u2019t see any structural effect. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.\nChris Growe: Yes. Thank you for that color. It was very good. I do want to ask very quickly about your outlook for the second quarter, you talk about IQOS devices -- device sales being down. Did you have a lot more users year-over-year? You don\u2019t expect to accumulate as many users as well, I get that. But I was trying to understand what would cause your device sales to be down in the second quarter. Is that just a function of less incremental users or are there any returns or that kind of thing going on as well?\nAndr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos: Well, it\u2019s primarily due to lesser acquisition during the period. Okay? Also, as I said, as the device life expectancy increases over time, we have less replacement. But clearly, during this period, our focus has been, and we repurpose part of our sales experts, if there is a problem with a device, we repurpose the people to do the delivery and service to consumers. So, we don\u2019t have an issue from that side. And I think we\u2019re doing a pretty good job from that point of view. I think it is essentially related to lower acquisition as we have assumed if it happens.\nChris Growe: Okay. And I just wanted to quick follow-up, which would be just to understand, embedded within your guidance for the upcoming quarter for Q2, there presumably are lower costs as well, whether it be lower -- less travel and lower maybe SG&A cost, that kind of thing, as well as obviously you\u2019ve kind of changed your IQOS investment plans here as well. So, is that sort of incorporated in the guidance that you framed that -- and you\u2019ve got a lot of cost savings coming through as well? Could you frame those factors that are helping support Q2 earnings on top of the negative effects you have coming through?\nMartin King: Yes. I mean, the Q2 number range we gave you is all in and includes our best estimate for basing of the cost and spending, including the additional focus on digital and some of the other areas where we can invest now to help us retool and be able to recover more quickly. So that number is all in because it includes things like, yes, lower travel, other cost spending categories that just aren\u2019t happening because people are working differently. It\u2019s all in there. Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler.\nAndr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos: Hello?\nMichael Lavery: [Technical Difficulty] on IQOS. And I think, you even touched on digital demonstrations\u2026\nAndr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos: Can you just stop, because you broke at the beginning of the question?\nMartin King: Could you repeat your question, Michael? You were breaking up at the beginning of your question.\nMichael Lavery: Yes. Sorry. You mentioned using more digital for IQOS. And I think, you even touched on digital demonstrations. And I guess, I just would love to understand maybe how creative and flexible you can be there. Do you mean a case where you deliver or loan a device to the consumer to try it at home or is that just watching someone do it online, or how should we think about how robust your digital interaction can be?\nAndr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos: Yes. We do loan devices, obviously with super accrued sanitary measures for the devices are new. And then, we do the guided trial by digital means. The coaches or the sales experts are operating from home and teaching the consumers. Currently, the consumers may have a bit more time. So, it\u2019s much easier to do it than in normal times as well. And that\u2019s how we operate. And I think, I was surprised that we maintained such high level. It may be a blessing I would say because that helps everybody, consumers on one side and our organization to move more and more into digital and learn in this crisis that you can do a lot of things from remote as well learning by operating from home by the way. So, that\u2019s a good thing. And maybe we can further increase the sales this way, which over time would allow us to optimize the infrastructure costs that we have. And we\u2019ve just gotten a boost I would say in a direction we\u2019re going in any case.\nMichael Lavery: Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And just one more on IQOS. You mentioned in Russia and EU that you already had lower device prices in the past quarter. Can you just describe what actions you\u2019ve taken there and are those temporary or permanent price rests?\nAndr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos: I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not sure we changed our device price, we had some promotion\u2026\nMartin King: I think it\u2019s more of a comparison year-over-year, just because we had some adjustments on device prices in the second half of last year. But, we\u2019re now comparing and lapping to the first quarter of last year when those adjustments hadn\u2019t occurred. When you come into the second half, I think you\u2019ll find the device pricing much more stable versus the prior year.\nMichael Lavery: Okay, great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Rampton of UBS.\nRobert Rampton: Hello. Thank you very much for taking my questions. I have two questions. The first is, looking at your 2Q 2020 revenue assumption. Can you let us know what the revenue -- the assumption was before? I think, you mentioned that 1H would have been 5% ex-COVID, which I guess would have implied to 3% for 2Q. Is that thinking correct? Thanks.\nMartin King: Yes. Q2, absent COVID impacts, net revenue would have been pretty much flat, a little bit. But the impacts of these other volume events that I mentioned, like Mexico comparison, Turkey comparison, impact of Indonesia, we\u2019re already going to pull our combined volumes down, minus 5.5% or so,, 6%. And therefore, the net revenues would have been just a little bit positive, not much, but a little bit positive, almost flat. So, what you\u2019re seeing now with the COVID-related impacts layered in is it\u2019s already built on a fairly weak quarter pace that we had flagged already going back to CAGNY and to year-end call as well. That\u2019s the first quarter. So, you have to look at the two in the context and take them. That\u2019s why I made the comment that if you average the first two quarters, absent the COVID impacts, we were right on track with our guidance, even frankly, a little bit ahead.\nRobert Rampton: Got it. That\u2019s very clear. And then, I guess, the longer term, I mean, think about 2021, 2022, should we start to expect excise tax increases and maybe government\u2019s closing the tax gaps as they look to raise revenue?\nAndr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos: Look, we haven\u2019t seen any of those things today, obviously. I think, governments will look for money, but they also know that regular tax increases are the best way to maximize revenue. And frankly speaking, if we look at the packages, the world is pledging to deploy, I don\u2019t think cigarettes will cover even an infinite fraction of it. Now, it\u2019s something to watch. This is pretty clear. But, we have no signs today of anything of this nature. That\u2019s what I can see at this stage.\nRobert Rampton: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. Our final question will come from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: Thank you. Hi, everyone.\nMartin King: Hi, Bonnie.\nAndr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos: Hi, Bonnie. Hope everything is okay.\nBonnie Herzog: Yes, everything\u2019s okay with me, hope for you guys too. I just wanted to clarify something that you said a lot earlier in the call. You touched on this. But, I wanted to clarify in terms of recruiting new users for IQOS that if you\u2019re able to touch consumers virtually and converse with them, you\u2019re not seeing any reluctance from them to convert to IQOS in this environment. So, that\u2019s the first clarification. And then, assuming your recruitment efforts for new users of IQOS remains pressured for the rest of Q2, as you discussed, just trying to understand how you see this impact in your core cigarette business.\nAndr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos: Well, I think, to your first question, I haven\u2019t heard of any difference in what we call the adoption funnel. Once a person is contacted, typically we have a very high purchase rates, because very often the people that come to the stores or the digital assets are people that are aware and frankly convinced. And obviously, the ones that come to our digital channels now are the most convinced. So, actually maybe we\u2019re higher, I don\u2019t have the numbers, we can come to you, than we used to be on average before, which is normal. Now, cigarettes is a bit more difficult to predict. Clearly, I see for IQOS, the momentum is there. And once we can resume the direct contacts also to people, we\u2019ll get back on track. Because I don\u2019t see any change in the momentum. I\u2019m very impressed actually that during the period we are where we are in terms of new consumers switching to IQOS.If you look at cannibalization rates, obviously, it would be less cannibalization if there is less acquisition of IQOS. But if that lasts a couple of months, I don\u2019t see that will dent any of the two. Okay? That rest is all the micro thing side discussed during the call, the temporary reductions in average daily consumption in some places. And then obviously it depends on where the world is going to end this crisis, we will see if there is any longer term recessionary impact. But as you know, cigarettes are very resistant to recession in general. So, it\u2019s more a question for a long-term perspective, which today is very difficult for any of us, frankly speaking, to evaluate. Okay? But we don\u2019t see any changes in the dynamics.\nBonnie Herzog: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, I may have missed this, but should we assume that your IQOS HTU volume target of 90 billion to 100 billion sticks is still reasonable by 2021? I know, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty, but do you still -- are you still leaving that I guess target out there?\nAndr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos: If the restrictions last for the quarter, I think we\u2019re still okay. If they last for a year, obviously, we need to delay the whole thing by a certain period of time. I think, the underlying trajectory is there. So, for the moment, I think that\u2019s how I see it.\nBonnie Herzog: Okay. And then, just a final quick one for me. In terms of marketing spend, you mentioned on the call that you guys are adjusting and investing more dollars in areas where you think you\u2019re going to get the biggest buck, if you will, probably digital. But, I\u2019m curious about the total dollar spent in 2020. I think you had targeted incremental, was it $300 million to $350 million this year. And I\u2019m just curious if that amount has changed at all, given everything?\nAndr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos: Well, just now, this investment in quarterly basis is a bit slowed down, obviously, because we don\u2019t have all the opportunities available. And obviously, we have flexibility because it is variable. Now, at this stage, we need to see when we come out of the crisis and if we need to double the Q1 resources for a period of time in order to catch up and if that makes sense from an investment point of view. So, we have flexibility there. If there is no opportunity, we will not spend all this money. And obviously, it will move to next year. That\u2019s how I see. Just now, it is a slower spending, obviously. The difference is despite the incremental investment in digital that is reallocating money.\nBonnie Herzog: Okay. Thank you so much.\nAndr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos: Thank you, Bonnie.\nOperator: And that was our final question. I\u2019ll now turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.\nAndr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos: Okay. Thank you all for joining the call. I understand there are exceptional circumstances for all of us. I would like to say that we don\u2019t see any problem in our business fundamentals, actually they remain very strong. I believe all of these things are temporary, but the temporary is the uncertainty. We tried to be as transparent as possible and give you as much granularity as we can. I think, overall, as far as the PMI operations are concerned, we are in fairly good shape, given the circumstances. And I hope that we move out of the crisis as soon as possible, so we resume business. But overall, I think the outlook for me on the longer term is -- remains the same as very positive. And we\u2019re very committed short term, to make sure that our operations continue, our employees are safe. And I think we\u2019ve done well there, because that\u2019s what will make our business stronger when we come out of the crisis.So, we\u2019ll keep you up to date. As I said, we have the shareholders meeting. If there\u2019s any news, we\u2019ll let you know. And bear with us in this period of uncertainty.\nNick Rolli: I have one final comment, Andr\u00e9, if you permit me to. I want to let everyone know this is Martin\u2019s last earnings call as Chief Financial Officer. As I think most of you know, he will be taking on a new role as the CEO of PMI America. So, I think, I speak for everyone at PMI, the organization, certainly the finance organization that works with him on a day to day basis to thank him for his service, his commitment, and his good sense of humor. We\u2019ll miss that. But, we also look forward to welcoming Emmanuel Babeau as our new CFO as of May 1st and joining us on these calls in the future. So, congratulations, Martin and best of luck to you.\nMartin King: Thank you very much, Nick.\nNick Rolli: So, that concludes our call for today. Thank you very much. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to the Investor Relations team. Thank you. Stay well, stay healthy.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Martin King",
            "content": "Thank you, Andre\u0301.I'll start with a headline summary of our first quarter performance, which was very strong in terms of like-for-like ex-currency growth before any pandemic impact. We estimate COVID-19 effects, primarily distributor and trade inventory movements, accounted for 2 points of net revenue growth, 110 basis points of adjusted operating income margin and 6.8 points of adjusted diluted earnings per share growth.Heated tobacco unit shipment volume grew 45% to 16.7 billion units, reflecting continued broad-based share gains. Total combined shipment volume decreased by a modest 0.6% on a like-for-like basis, benefiting from inventory movements. Currency-neutral net revenues grew by 10%, reflecting the volume growth and positive geographic mix of HTUs, in addition to a strong combustible tobacco pricing variance of 7.7%. This robust revenue growth, combined with a positive margin mix, scale effects of higher HTU volumes, cost efficiencies and cost phasing drove a 510 basis-point increase in our adjusted currency-neutral operating income margin, and30.1% growth in currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS.This excellent start to the year, with encouraging progress in both our combustible and reduced-risk product businesses, is particularly important as we consider the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.While we expect our core existing operations to continue performing well, there are three main areas of expected impact from temporary changes to our operating environment, in addition to the impact of currency movements, which I'll come back to. The first, and likely longest in duration, is on Duty-Free sales, due to severely curtailed global travel. For context, PMI Duty-Free, with a market share of 37%, contributed almost 4% of our 2019 net revenues. It also enjoys higher unit margins relative to the global average, given the skew to premium brands such as Marlboro and HEETS. Consumer offtake trends exited March with declines of over 80%, and we expect similar trends to continue until travel starts to recover.Due to the premium skew of our Duty-Free sales, we assume that only a portion of the volume will be recovered by our own brand portfolio in local markets, usually at lower margins.The second impact is on the rate of IQOS user acquisition. Lockdown measures and other restrictions hamper our ability to engage adult smokers. Our IQOS retail touch-points are currently closed in a number of markets, and even where open, retail footfall is significantly down. Our investments in digital capabilities over recent quarters are now coming into their own, and we are reallocating further commercial spend to digital where required. Our commercial sales experts and coaches, although very limited in terms of physical consumer engagement, have a number of tools at their disposal to conduct virtual guided trials. However, based on trends since lockdown measures were introduced, we expect our rate of user acquisition to be on average around 50% lower than previously anticipated, for as long as widespread restrictions continue. Variations by country also make the mix difficult to project. To be clear, we believe this is delayed rather than lost growth and we expect the strong underlying momentum witnessed in recent quarters to pick up as restrictions ease. Importantly, given our digital capabilities, we do not expect customer retention or conversion rates to be affected.For illustrative purposes, each 1 million users acquired have an annualized consumption of around 5 billion heated tobacco units and, using pre-COVID market mix including device sales and cannibalization effects, would generate on average over $350 million in net revenues and over $200 million in incremental contribution.We are also able to flex our commercial initiatives, and accordingly the timing of plans for IQOS VEEV, our improved e-vapor product, and the licensed KT&G products later this year could be delayed depending on how events unfold.The last main area of impact is in Indonesia. As explained previously, 2020 was already a year of catch-up on excise tax and pricing. A positive structural element of the new excise tax was a larger percentage increase at the mid-to-low segment of the market, with a new minimum retail selling price due to come into effect on April 1st. However, the government has now said the enforcement of the new minimum price is delayed until June, due to COVID-19 restrictions. The prolonging of unfavorable price gaps is an added headwind for the risk of down-trading, the timing of price increases and for our market share.While the effects of pandemic-related measures on our operating environment, such as travel restrictions, are tangible, there is greater uncertainty as to the social and economic impact on consumer purchasing behavior during the crisis.In developed markets, like the EU region or Japan, which tend to have strong social support programs, we have so far observed only a limited impact. There have been instances of pantry-loading in certain markets around the introduction of restrictions. However, these have been generally short-lived in nature and had a minimal impact on Q1 performance, with distributor and trade inventory movements being the bigger influence.In certain developing markets, the high prevalence of daily wage workers, lower resources for social support and thus greater fragility of incomes create more vulnerability. We observe some initial signs of down-trading and reduced daily consumption in some countries. The most significant for us are Indonesia and the Philippines, the latter of which has the added dynamic of being a stick market. We have to assume these trends will temporarily continue while pandemic-driven restrictions last.As Andre\u0301 mentioned, given less developed route-to-market infrastructure, we also sense potential difficulties in certain emerging markets for some smaller general trade outlets, which may lead to temporary localized out-of-stocks.Our own manufacturing and distribution operations continue to function well despite current challenges. This is made possible by the incredible efforts of our supply chain and market teams, who have implemented a number of contingency measures with regard to production and customer supply. On average, inventories of our products remain healthy, with over two months for heated tobacco units, over three months on IQOS devices and over one and a half months for cigarettes, including distributors.After the one week suspension of production at our Bologna HTU facility in late March, all our HTU factories are currently operating with sufficient capacity. Around 20% of our cigarette production capacity is currently affected by temporary shutdowns. However, we do not currently foresee any out-of-stocks in major operating income markets. One watch-out is Argentina, where we will be facing out-of-stocks if the factory does not reopen soon.Given investor focus on the liquidity of listed companies in the current environment, I want to highlight our robust position. We continue to have ample liquidity sources through the ongoing cash generation of our business, cash on hand and access to commercial paper. Our $7.5 billion revolving credit facility remains undrawn.Our balance sheet remains strong with a well-laddered bond portfolio and net debt of 1.9 times adjusted EBITDA as of March 31, 2020. We repaid $3.6 billion of maturing bonds during the first quarter and distributed a total of $3.6 billion in dividends to shareholders in January and April.We also expect that strong cash flows will exceed cash requirements, including the funding of dividends, to which we remain fully committed. Our ability to invest appropriately in our business and retire debt is fully intact. However, further deleveraging of our balance sheet, at prevailing exchange rates, may be somewhat delayed versus our previous expectations.It's also worth mentioning that our cost efficiency programs continue, and that we remain well on track to deliver over $1 billion in efficiencies by 2021. These programs are also flexible, and we are reprioritizing activities as events unfold. Related to this, we expect to reduce capital expenditures to approximately $0.8 billion for the year, with the reduction unrelated to RRP investments.We turn now to guidance. As covered in our earnings release, we have withdrawn our previous reported diluted full-year 2020 EPS forecast of at least $5.50, which absent COVID-19, our business was well on track to deliver. However, as we stand today, there is simply not enough visibility on the duration or extent of lockdown and social isolation measures, and their wider consequences, to provide a sufficiently reliable full-year earnings estimate. Given comparatively better short-term visibility, we are therefore introducing quarterly guidance, one quarter forward, in its place.As previously flagged, we already expected a weak second quarter, notably due to an unfavorable prior year comparison, market dynamics in Indonesia, and cost phasing. We also expect the biggest quarterly impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business to occur in the period, which we additionally factor in.Consequently, we expect Q2 2020 reported diluted EPS to be in a range of $1 to $1.10. This forecast assumes unfavorable impacts of $0.12 for currency, at prevailing rates, reflecting the devaluation of many of our operating currencies vis-a\u0300-vis the U.S. dollar, notably including the Russian ruble, Indonesian rupiah and Mexican peso; $0.10 for inventory movements, primarily reversals from the first quarter; $0.09 for lost Duty-Free sales, net of domestic sales recapture, assuming no recovery in global travel in the period; and $0.05 to $0.15 for the delay in Indonesia minimum price enforcement and other COVID-19 related factors, including temporary reductions in daily consumption and down-trading in certain developing markets. These assumptions also reflect ex-currency net revenue declines of approximately 8% to 12%, with the expected decline being wholly attributable to COVID-19 related impacts, including on device sales.Let me now run through some of the main elements of our first quarter performance. We estimate the total international industry declined 2.9% in the period. However, we recorded a total like-for-like shipment volume decline of only 0.6%, with cigarette declines of 3.8%, largely offset by the impressive 45.5% growth of heated tobacco units, with notable contributions from the EU region, Japan and Russia.Excluding the net favorable impact of estimated distributor inventory movements, our total in-market sales volume declined by 3.7%. Inventory movements reflect two main factors: Firstly, the prior year comparison where shipment volumes in Q1, 2019 were below in-market sales; and secondly, net distributor inventory build-up in Q1 2020 to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 related disruption.Importantly, our HTU in-market sales volume increased by 3.9% sequentially versus the fourth quarter, reaching over 17 billion units in what is typically the lowest volume quarter of the year. This strong performance means that heated tobacco units now make up nearly 10% of our total shipment volume, as compared to 8% in 2019, and almost nothing in 2015. We expect this proportion to grow further as our positive momentum on RRPs continues.Turning to our financial results. Net revenues increased by 10% excluding currency, driven by pricing in combustibles, a favorable comparison versus Q1 2019 and growth in heated tobacco units. We estimate the COVID-19 effect of higher trade inventories and, to a lesser extent, consumer pantry-loading contributed around one-fifth of the growth in net revenues, operating income and EPS.We recorded a strong combustible tobacco pricing variance of 7.7%, with no significant impact of COVID-19 and notable contributions from the GCC, Germany, Mexico, the Philippines, Russia and Turkey.Adjusted operating income increased by 25.5% ex-currency, while currency-neutral adjusted operating income margin grew by an excellent 510 basis points. This strong margin expansion was driven by RRP scale effects and favorable geographic mix for HTUs. Additional drivers include pricing in combustibles, cost phasing and the underlying impact of cost initiatives.Adjusted diluted EPS increased strongly, growing by 30.1% excluding currency. With regard to currency, we should point out that the unfavorable impact of $0.13 in the first quarter includes $0.07 of transactional impact occurred in March, primarily from the revaluation of euro or dollar denominated payables in certain markets, such as Russia, where the local currency has seen a significant devaluation. Such effects would only recur in future quarters if further sharp devaluations took place.RRP net revenues reached $1.6 billion, or close to 22% of PMI's total net revenues, with IQOS devices accounting for approximately 10% of RRP net revenues.Turning now to market share. Our total international share was slightly lower to 27.9%, with higher share for heated tobacco units, which reached 2.9%, offset by lower share for cigarettes. The share of our cigarette portfolio declined by 1.1 points reflecting continued adult smoker out-switching to IQOS and lower share notably in Argentina and Indonesia, due to price gaps with tax-advantaged local competitors, trade inventory movements in Pakistan and an unfavorable prior year comparison in Turkey.Let's turn to Indonesia, where industry volumes declined by only 0.6% in the first quarter due to trade loading effects, which are likely to reverse in the second quarter. Pricing was taken on all main premium and mid-price brands, with PMI price increases since October of 2019 representing approximately 85% of the weighted-average pass-on of the 2020 excise increase. Our share declined, despite a recovery in premium A Mild due to smaller price gaps with directly competitive brands. These gains were outweighed by our mid and low-priced brands, which lost share to super-low price manufacturers who are tax advantaged due to smaller scale.It follows that the delay in the enforcement of the minimum selling price extends this temporary share headwind. The prevalence of daily wage workers in Indonesia also introduces some uncertainty as to the effects of social restrictions on daily consumption. As such, we have to assume the total market decline will be higher than our previous estimate of 6% to 7%.Turning now to RRP performance. We estimate that there were 14.6 million total IQOS users as of March 31st, representing the addition of more than 4 million adult users since the same time last year. We further estimate that 73% of this total or 10.6 million IQOS users have stopped smoking and switched to IQOS, with the balance in various stages of conversion. This reflects widespread user growth momentum across all key IQOS geographies, including Japan, Russia and the EU.The overall share performance of IQOS HTUs continues to see excellent progress. Indeed, in international markets where IQOS has been commercialized, IQOS HTUs were again the third-largest tobacco brand in the first quarter with 6.6% share, increasing from 5.5% in Q4 2019. This was achieved despite not having full national distribution in a number of markets.In the EU region, first-quarter share for HEETS reached 3.9% of total industry volume, with an estimated 0.2 points due to consumer pantry-loading. On a sequential basis, share growth was also very strong, increasing by 0.7 points, with in-market sales volume 13% higher compared to Q4 2019, despite a typically lower quarter. I also refer you to the appendix where we show shares by key EU market and global key cities.IQOS continued its strong performance in Russia, with HEETS share up by 3.5 points to reach 6.5%. On a sequential basis versus the fourth quarter of 2019, HEETS share increased by 1.5 points, while in-market sales increased by 3%. With limited social restrictions in Russia in the period, there was minimal estimated impact of pantry-loading.In Japan, our total reported share for heated tobacco units increased by 2.1 points to reach 19.1% in the first quarter, supported by the launch of IQOS 3 DUO and line extensions in our Marlboro HeatSticks and HEETS line-ups.On an adjusted total tobacco view including cigarillos and adjusted for trade inventory movements, the share of our HTU brands increased by 1.1 points versus the prior year quarter, and by 0.6 points sequentially, to 17.7%.Q1 2020 adjusted in-market sales volumes for our HTU brands grew 6.2% compared to an adjusted total tobacco market which declined by around 1%. This helped drive growth of the overall heated tobacco category to a first-quarter total tobacco share of over 24%.Lastly, following the 2019 launch of IQOS in the U.S. through our commercial arrangement with Altria, in March, we submitted a supplemental PMTA for the IQOS 3 device to the FDA to further support the efforts to convert U.S. adult consumers who would otherwise continue to smoke. FDA's review of the Company's Modified Risk Tobacco Product applications for the IQOS tobacco heating system, which is separate from this PMTA application, continues.Let me now hand back to Andre\u0301 for closing remarks. Andre\u0301?\nAndre\u0301 Calantzopoulos: Thank you, Martin.In summary, the continued strong underlying momentum in our business, especially the impressive growth of reduced-risk products, is again evident in our first quarter results.The world has clearly now changed, with considerable uncertainty as to the development and duration of the pandemic and its economic and social consequences, including those which impact our operating environment and our consumers.Our business has historically proven remarkably resilient, and we believe we can deliver a solid performance under the current challenging circumstances. Importantly, we remain confident in our structural mid-term growth prospects and, when these headwinds have passed, expect to resume growth consistent with our 2019 to 2021 compound annual ex-currency growth targets of at least 5% net revenue growth and at least 8% adjusted earnings per share growth.Crucially, our organization, liquidity and balance sheet are strong. We will continue to protect and support our employees, serve our consumers and reward our shareholders, which clearly includes our strong commitment to our dividend.We remain resolute in our strategy for a smoke-free future and are convinced that we'll emerge stronger from this crisis.Thank you. Martin and I are happy now to answer your questions. I'd just add to that. Pam, we're also not seeing any drop-off in conversion rates. Conversion rates, in fact, they're looking quite strong. So, the underlying business and retaining consumers and conversion consumer is going great. Obviously, your ability to have the face to face interaction has little bit slowed down, but we're switching as fast as we can to more digital channels. The first principle that we've undertaken is that our investments need to align in the new situation. In other words, we are, if anything, putting more money into those aspects which will help us recover momentum and get back to growth as soon as the lockdown ends. Hence the focus on where we can add some investment around digital and around the programs which will have a bigger impact later. But clearly, we've gone through our projects as well to see which ones are hampered by our inability to operate right now and need to be retimed and move some of the spending further later in the year or even into the next year. And we've also looked again at our list of projects to prioritize the ones that maybe had not as good a return and try to mitigate some of the impacts of what we're seeing from the COVID-related.So, overall, our cost savings are on track. If anything, we will accelerate some as we can. And then, our investments part is also lining up to the new situation and giving us the biggest bang for our buck. So, we are looking long term and looking towards the growth momentum that we can attain as we come out of this. It's exactly right. It's a matter of when they can get out there and start inspecting. It's not a matter of not wanting to do it. It's purely for their issue with their inspectors.\nAndre\u0301 Calantzopoulos: Now, in Indonesia, we have these, and obviously in Indonesia -- is in the category of these developing markets. Martin mentioned in his remarks and myself that we have a lot of casual -- or many people work on a daily salary essentially. And if they can't work, clearly their consumption has to adjust to the situation. So, we have to assume here that we may have some impact also on consumption coming from COVID. Other Southeast Asian markets can be impacted; Africa as well. So, we observe this phenomenon. And we had to make a forecast in our numbers of what that impact is going to be. You all appreciate it is rather difficult.And if I take, for example, a market we know very well, like the Philippines, this confinement clearly has some impact also in daily consumption. Also, it's a very broad trade with very small players, sometimes they run out-of-stock. And if we take markets with stick sales also, if we have an average stick sale -- an average consumption of sticks of or 9 per day, you go to 8 that's a 10%, 11% impact temporarily on the market. Now, how precise to be on this? I don't know. That's why we gave a broad range in these areas; I think some will happen. The people are not going to be immune to the confine. That's why we try to bake some numbers in. And I think it's reasonable to assume it at this stage. If it's better, it's better.Third question? Adam that's pretty close to Q2 estimate of $0.12. It will be roughly that in Q3 and Q4 at prevailing exchange rates, $0.11 to $0.12 something like that. Yes. I mean, when you look at the second quarter for example, we already had expected a pretty weak second quarter due to the dynamics out there on how we were wrapping pricing in Turkey for example where you had a big market gains before in the previous comparable periods against a 40% price increase that we've had since then. We were looking at Mexico with the different timing on the price increase and the way the trade inventory we were working being a pretty big headwind. So, we already had looked at Indonesia. We knew that the big impact was coming in Q2. So, the Q2 guidance we're giving is actually if you unpick it, it's actually what we had expected before it's purely the COVID-related. We would have ended up without COVID after the first half being right on track with our full year numbers and hitting 9.5%, 10% EPS growth, right in with what we had thought we would end up for the full year.So, when you go forward and say what are we going to do for the rest of the year? We're going to basically be giving you each quarter one quarter ahead, what the COVID-related impacts are and trying to adjust to new news around lockdown timings and recoveries from consumers and so forth. And that's what we thought was more prudent, given that the underlying business is in fine shape or doing exactly what we thought. But it's very difficult to predict how this COVID-related piece is coming out. So, we can't really give you the full-year look right now, but we can give you each quarter ahead as best we predict what will happen given the latest news that we have. No, we have some -- as Andre\u0301 mentioned, we have some watch-outs in there, around average daily consumption, around down-trading in certain markets. But, it's not really a price elasticity point of view. As far as pricing goes -- price timing, we have to be cognizant that in the case of lockdowns and in certain periods, it may not be wise to take some of the pricing at exactly the same timing we had in the original plan. So, we will have to look at the timing of pricing in certain markets. In some markets, we will likely need to delay some planned pricing. On the other hand, we will look forward out into the year and see what we can do to try to compensate for that. So, it's more around timing of price increases that have to be rephased and rescheduled. And there may be -- likely will be some lower total pricing during the year than what we had originally planned just because you run out of runway, as you give up some of the windows due to the lockdowns, et cetera. You run out of runway to make up for some of the pricing that you will not be able to take over the next, say couple of weeks, months because of lockdown.\nAndre\u0301 Calantzopoulos: I mean, all they are assumptions at this stage, but they're not relating to price elasticity, in my view. It's restating to do you go, and will governments allow that you take in one or two places a price increase in the middle of a crisis, I don't think psychologically from a consumer point of view is a right thing. So, these are a couple of months or a month delay. But in the vast majority of the places, we don't see any price elasticity in the short-term. Now, in the long run, I don't know what the impact of COVID is going to be on the world economy. But, if the world GDP comes down substantially for a longer period of time, you may need to revise elasticities. But as you know, in cigarettes, it is very rare that we need to revise elasticities, except in very big price increase. Yes. I mean, the Q2 number range we gave you is all in and includes our best estimate for basing of the cost and spending, including the additional focus on digital and some of the other areas where we can invest now to help us retool and be able to recover more quickly. So that number is all in because it includes things like, yes, lower travel, other cost spending categories that just aren't happening because people are working differently. It's all in there. Yes. Could you repeat your question, Michael? You were breaking up at the beginning of your question. I think it's more of a comparison year-over-year, just because we had some adjustments on device prices in the second half of last year. But, we're now comparing and lapping to the first quarter of last year when those adjustments hadn't occurred. When you come into the second half, I think you'll find the device pricing much more stable versus the prior year. Yes. Q2, absent COVID impacts, net revenue would have been pretty much flat, a little bit. But the impacts of these other volume events that I mentioned, like Mexico comparison, Turkey comparison, impact of Indonesia, we're already going to pull our combined volumes down, minus 5.5% or so,, 6%. And therefore, the net revenues would have been just a little bit positive, not much, but a little bit positive, almost flat. So, what you're seeing now with the COVID-related impacts layered in is it's already built on a fairly weak quarter pace that we had flagged already going back to CAGNY and to year-end call as well. That's the first quarter. So, you have to look at the two in the context and take them. That's why I made the comment that if you average the first two quarters, absent the COVID impacts, we were right on track with our guidance, even frankly, a little bit ahead. Hi, Bonnie.\nAndre\u0301 Calantzopoulos: Hi, Bonnie. Hope everything is okay. Thank you very much, Nick."

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session.  Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.\nNick Rolli: Welcome, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2021 fourth-quarter and full year results. You may access the release on www.pmi.com. A glossary of terms, including the definition for reduced-risk products, or RRPs, as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures and additional heated tobacco unit market share data are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Unless otherwise stated, all references to IQOS are to our IQOS heat-not-burn products and all references to smoke-free products are to our RRPs. Growth rates presented on an organic basis reflect currency-neutral underlying results. Following the acquisitions of Fertin Pharma, OtiTopic and Vectura Group, PMI added the other category in the third quarter of 2021. Business operations for the other category are evaluated separately from the geographical operating segments. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. Please also note the additional forward-looking and cautionary statements related to COVID-19. It's now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Executive Officer; and Emmanuel Babeau, our Chief Financial Officer. Over to you, Jacek.\nJacek Olczak: Thank you, Nick, and welcome, everyone. I hope you all say on well. Our business delivered an excellent performance in 2021, reaching record net revenues, adjusted diluted EPS and cash flow with growth in overall volumes, high single-digit organic net revenue growth and strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth. This illustrates the sustainable nature of our growth based on new products and innovation, as demonstrated by the continued strength of IQOS, which delivered 31% full year organic growth in RRP net revenues. Smoke-free products surpassed 30% of total net revenues in Q4, as we progress towards our ambition of becoming a predominantly smoke-free company by 2025. We were especially pleased by the reacceleration of our business in Q4 to deliver a better-than-expected result. This reacceleration was visible in organic net revenues, IQOS user growth, heated tobacco unit market shares across developed and emerging markets, innovation in devices and consumables, and commercial investments and combustible share. IQOS user growth recovered in Q4 to reach an estimated 21.2 million total users, despite ongoing tightness in device supplies in the second half of the year. Full year heated tobacco unit shipment volumes grew 25% to reach 95 billion units, with broad-based growth for both our volumes and the category across key geographies, with an especially positive rebound in the EU. The growth outlook for IQOS remains very positive, with outstanding initial results from IQOS ILUMA in Japan and Switzerland, the only two launches so far, and growing traction for IQOS VEEV in early launch markets. In combustibles, we essentially reached our goal of stable category share in the fourth quarter despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization. During the year, we laid the foundations for our long-term growth ambitions beyond nicotine in Wellness and Healthcare, including the milestone acquisitions of Fertin and Vectura, which provide essential capabilities for future product development. And last, bolstered by strong operating cash flow, we continued to prioritize returns to shareholders through a 4.2% increase in the dividend and ongoing share repurchases. Turning to the headline numbers. Our full year adjusted net revenues grew organically by 7.6% or 10.3% in dollar terms, including positive currency. This reflects the continued underlying strength of IQOS and the ongoing recovery of the combustible business in many markets compared to the pandemic affected prior year. Our net revenue per unit grew 5.3% organically driven by the increasing proportion of IQOS in our sales mix and pricing. Combustible pricing was in line with our expectations at 2.7% or around 4%, excluding Indonesia. Our adjusted operating income margin increased by 200 basis points on an organic basis, in line with our expectations, with continued positive effects from the increasing size and profitability of IQOS, pricing and productivity savings. Through first half expansion -- although strong H1 expansion was tempered in the second half by the expected initial higher unit cost of IQOS ILUMA, geographic and category expansion investment and the Q4 resumption of consumer programs in a number of markets. Our resulting adjusted diluted EPS of $6.08 represents 17.6% growth in dollar terms and 15.3% currency-neutral growth, which is well above our prior guidance as IQOS user growth, the launch of Illuma and total industry volumes exceeded our expectations. Finally, we generated operating cash flow of $12 billion, reflecting excellent underlying cash conversion in addition to strong Q4 business results and certain timing factors. Looking at our Q4 performance, net revenues grew by 8.4% organically. This reflects the sequential improvement in IQOS user acquisition the initial success of ILUMA in Japan and strong overall volumes, including a further recovery in combustibles. We delivered robust organic net revenue per unit growth of 4.1%, again reflecting our shift in business mix. We achieved this despite softer pricing on combustibles of 1.4% due to the factors flagged previously of continued pandemic-related challenges in certain markets as well as comparison effects in Germany and Australia. Our Q4 adjusted operating income margin declined by 10 basis points on an organic basis, primarily due to the same factors mentioned for the second half as accelerating business performance opened more opportunities for investment in future growth. Despite that, our currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS, again grew strongly by 11.9%, also reflecting a lower interest cost and effective tax rate. Turning now to 2022 guidance. After the temporary slowdown in IQOS user growth in the second half of 2021, the device supply situation is gradually improving. While the situation remains fluid, we now expect a more limited impact, allowing us to gradually return to prior rates of user progression over the coming quarters. With the remarkable success of ILUMA in its first market, a number of other innovations planned and promising growth for IQOS in low and middle income markets, our 2022 growth fundamentals are strong, and we look forward to an exciting year. We note that the slower user growth in the second half of 2021, particularly in the third quarter, will have an estimated carryover effect on our growth this year of around 4 billion to 5 billion cubic tobacco units. This is reflected in our 2022 expectations of 113 million to 118 billion H2 shipment volume. Given this continued growth, we expect our full year H2 shipments to again be ahead of IMS volumes. We expect to deliver between 4% and 6% organic net revenue growth keeping us well on track to deliver our 2021 -- 2021, 2023 compound annual growth rate target of more than 5%. This range prudently incorporates the continuing uncertainty on full device availability and the pace of the ongoing pandemic recovery. For Duty Free, we assume no meaningful pickup in Asian travel, but a continued gradual recovery in other geographies. We expect our adjusted operating income margin to expand between 50 and 150 basis points as the positive effects of our product transformation continues, despite the expectation of a moderately lower gross margin. This is essentially attributable to temporary ILUMA related factors such as the higher initial weight and cost of TEREA consumables and the cost of devices, which we expect to decrease over the 18 to 24 months post-launch as we have experienced in previous -- with previous major innovations. We also account for higher logistic costs, where the tremendous uptake of ILUMA in Japan has led to increased use of air freight investments to grow capacity across our smoke-free platforms and inflation in certain supply chain elements. Operating income margin expansion and continued growth opportunities and in wellness and healthcare R&D will again be supported by our ongoing efficiency programs. We remain on track to deliver around $2 billion in gross savings by 2023. Accordingly, we forecast currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of 8% to 11%. This translates into an adjusted diluted EPS range of $6.12 to $6.30, including an estimated unfavorable currency impact of around $0.45 at prevailing rates. This is primarily due to translation effects, and this currency impact reflects notably the appreciation of the euro, Japanese yen and Turkish lira versus the dollar. This guidance includes the impact of $785 million of share repurchases made in 2021, which were somewhat restricted by blackout periods. It does not reflect the impact of repurchases in 2022 as we continue to take an opportunistic approach within our target of between $5 billion to $7 billion over three years. Our guidance also reflects the impact of acquired businesses, which we expect to generate underlying operating income in line with our business plan, but with an operating loss of around $150 million or approximately 1% of adjusted diluted EPS, which we'll come back to explain later. As outlined in today's release, there are a number of other assumptions underpinning our outlook. We expect the total industry volume of cigarettes and to cubic tobacco units, excluding the U.S. and China to decline between minus 1% and minus 2%. Given our leadership in smoke-free product, the structural growth of the category and its growing proportion in our business, we expect to gain share a target broadly stable total PMI shipment volumes within the range of minus 1% to plus 1%. We assume full year combustible pricing of 3% to 4% with a softer first half and a stronger second half of the year. And this is clearly above 2021 levels. The pricing environment is improving but still challenging central markets with ongoing pandemic related impacts. Our balance sheet is strong. We delivered excellent operating cash flow of $12 billion in 2021, reflecting robust underlying cash conversion in addition to favorable timing and one-off impact of around $0.5 billion. With further strong organic profit growth expected in 2022, we expect to generate around $11 billion of operating cash flow, subject to year-end working capital requirements and after accounting for the reversal of timing benefits and using prevailing exchange rates. As a result, we raised our 2021 to '23 operating cash flow target communicated at the February 2021 Investor Day at $35 billion to the range of $36 billion to $37 billion. We also expect full year capital expenditures of around $1 billion, reflecting increased capacity investments behind our smoke-free platforms, including ILUMA and enhancing our digital commercial engine in addition to certain projects, which were delayed due to the pandemic. Lastly, looking specifically to the first quarter of 2022, we expect adjusted diluted EPS of $1.50 to $1.55, including $0.15 of unfavorable currency at prevailing rates. We expect robust organic top line growth and operating margins comparisons, which reflect above the very strong prior year quarter, which benefited from a high level of productivity savings and relatively low levels of investment and the Q1 of 2022 dynamics of commercial investments, ILUMA related costs and increases in some inputs such as freight. Let me now hand over to Emmanuel, who will give you more details of our performance in 2021.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Jacek. Turning back to our 2021 results. Total shipment volumes increased by plus 4.2% in Q4 and by plus 2.2% for the year. This reflects continued strong broad-based growth from HTUs of plus 25% or 18.9 billion units for the full year, comfortably exceeding the decline of 3.6 billion cigarettes. The plus 2.4% increase in our Q4 cigarette volumes reflect the continued sequential recovery of the total industry and of our category share, in addition to a 2.7 billion stick favorable inventory movement, which mainly reflects inventory reduction in the prior year quarter. Due to the remarkable performance of IQOS, inter tobacco units comprised almost 14% of our total shipment volume in the fourth quarter and 13.2% for the year, as compared to 11% in full year 2020, 8% in 2019 and 5% in 2018. Our sales mix is evolving rapidly, putting us on track to become a majority smoke-free company by 2025. Smoke-free net revenues made up over 30% of our adjusted total revenue in Q4 and 29% for the year as compared to 24% in 2020. In 10 markets, we have already surpassed 50%. IQOS devices accounted for over 6% of the $9.1 billion of 2021 RP net revenues with a step up in H2, reflecting the IQOS ILUMA launch, outweighing the effect of supply constraint on the IQOS versions. We delivered plus 7.6% organic growth in 2021 net revenues on shipment volume growth of plus 2.2%, reflecting the twin engines driving our top line. The first is pricing on combustible and in certain markets on HTUs. Second is the increasing mix of HTUs in our business at higher net revenue per unit, which continues to deliver substantial growth and increasingly powerful driver as our transformation accelerates. Let's now turn to the driver of our 2021 margin expansion. Our gross margin increased by 190 basis points on an organic basis due to product mix, pricing and cost savings, while our adjusted marketing, administration and research costs were 10 basis points better as a percentage of adjusted net revenues. We generated over $800 million in gross cost savings in 2021 with around $550 million in manufacturing and supply chain productivity and more than $250 million in SG&A efficiency before inflation. This represents strong progress towards our target of around $2 billion for 2021, 2023 and allows us to reinvest in top line growth while continuing to deliver robust margin progression. While OI margin expansion was lower in H2, this reflects the positive dynamic of our business and the ability to return to normalized investment levels compared to the pandemic affected prior year. ILUMA device and HTU shipments commenced with higher initial unit cost and we reaccelerated investments in our commercial program, digital engine and R&D as well as a number of growth opportunities across categories and geographies. We intend to continue investing in such opportunities in 2022. But with the benefit of scale, operating leverage and accelerated efficiencies we continue to target organic SG&A increases below the rate of sales growth. Moving now to market share. Our share of the combustible category recovered and was essentially stable in Q4 on a year-over-year basis, as our portfolio initiatives bear fruit and pandemic-linked restrictions received in many markets. Our leadership in combustible helps to maximize switching to smoke-free products and we continue to target a stable category share over time despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization. Aside consumer growth, we accelerate, we target at first a slightly decline in 2022. For the combustible category overall, the improving total market backdrop includes notable Q4 recoveries in Indonesia, Mexico and Turkey, close to stable industry volume in the EU region and a modest recovery in duty free driven by sales outside Asia. Daily consumption remains below pre-coded level in certain markets such as the Philippines, where our share of market is influenced by mobility and social consumption. In Indonesia, our share was again broadly stable on a sequential basis despite the continued growth of the below Tier 1 segment and our volumes grew over 4% for the year. The reduction from 10 to 8 excise tax year in 2022 represents a step in the right direction, and the industry weighted average excise increase of around plus 13% is slightly below the prior year. However, the playing field remained unequaled between industry players and the pricing environment remains challenging. In terms of our overall share, ongoing gain for our IQOS portfolio create positive momentum going into this year, and we expect to resume overall share growth as well as achieving broadly stable total shipment volume. PMI HTUs now have a 7.1% share in the markets where they are present, making them the third largest tobacco brand. This includes the number one position in five markets, and the number two in a further six markets. Moving now to IQOS performance. We estimate there were approximately 21.2 million IQOS users as of December 31. The improved growth of plus 0.8 million in Q4 reflects our agile commercial model, which allowed us to rapidly adjust our consumer program and assortment. As demonstrated by the performance of ILUMA in Japan and Switzerland, the underlying momentum of the IQOS brand remains strong. While we don't yet have full visibility over the full year of 2022, as device shortages ease, we expect to gradually return to user growth at or above the prior run rate of around 1 million per quarter. We estimate that 72% of total users or 15.3 million adult smokers have switched to IQOS and stopped smoking with the balance in various stages of conversion. In the EU region, Fourth quarter HTU share reached 6.4% of total cigarette and HTU industry revenue, 1.4 points higher than Q4 last year. Underlying IMS growth trends remain excellent. This very good performance included strong growth across the region, with Italy reaching the milestone of 2 million users and positive contribution from Germany and Poland. I also want to highlight Hungary where our Q4 national HTU share exceeded 20%, following Japan and Lithuania enriching this important threshold. To give some further color on our progress in the EU region, this slide shows a selection of the latest key city of offtake shares. While Vilnius continued to lead the way with 37.5% share, the 20% level was also reached in Budapest, Rome and Athens. With strong progress across the region, we are especially pleased by Vienna, almost doubling to 4%, the strong traction in London at almost 6% share, and an acceleration in Zurich with the introduction of IQOS ILUMA. We show further HTU share data in the appendix to these slides. Share growth continued in Russia with our Q4 TU share up by plus 0.8 points to reach 8%. For both Russia and the overall region, sequential growth in adjusted IMS slowed in the last two quarters, partly reflecting the more acute device shortage and lead on commercial program. In addition, the region was affected by the halting of sales in Belarus, which impacted sequential IMF growth in Q4. In this context, as mentioned in last quarter, we have seen some increased discounted competitor offerings and disposable e-vapor products. We continue to see high interest in the category and with a pipeline of exciting innovations plan, including the launch of ILUMA, we aim to resume strong growth this year. In Japan now, the adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by plus-1.7 points to a record 21.8% in Q4. And an offtake exit share approaching 23%, with Q4 adjusted IMS sequential trends, incorporating the pull forward of consumer uptake into Q3 before the price increase. This performance reflects the strength of our portfolio and the launch of IQOS ILUMA, which I will come back to shortly. The overall heated tobacco category continues to grow, making up over 31% of the adjusted total Japanese tobacco market in Q4; with IQOS maintaining a high share of segment and capturing the majority of the category's 2021 growth. In addition to the strong progress in developed countries, we see very promising IQOS growth in low and middle income market. A prime example of this is Egypt where offtake share in Cairo is approaching 4% within six months of launch with other notable successes, including Lebanon, Jordan, the Dominican Republic and the Philippines despite funding in retraction in Manila. This low and middle-income market key city performance is especially encouraging as we achieved it despite the premium position of the current IQOS portfolio. We do intend to bring a new complementary range of heat-not-burn products tailored to emerging markets towards the end of this year, which I will come back to. With this potential in mind, we continue to drive the geographic expansion of our smoke-free products as we aim to be in 100 markets by 2025. During the quarter, we launched IQOS in both Morocco and Tunisia. This takes the total number of markets where PMI smoke-free products are available for sale to 71, of which 30 are in low and middle-income markets. We plan to add more market this year as we also meaningfully broaden our product offer and price segmentation within existing geography. This includes the expansion of feel and feet, which are now available in over 20 markets across multiple regions and our expansion of e-vapor and nicotine pouches. Following the implementation of the ITC's importation ban, IQOS is not currently available in the U.S. We continue to work on contingency plans, including domestic manufacturing and hope to be able to resume U.S. supply in the first half of 2023. It is important to remember that the ITC's decision on this patent is an outlier. We were encouraged by the U.S. patent office recent invalidation of one of the two patents included in the ITC ruling, and we expect a decision on the second patent by April 2, though this decision are subject to an appeal process. BAT has been universally unsuccessful in asserting the same two patent families against IQOS in Europe. Separately, in December, a German court ruled that BAT's GLO HYPER dual-coil heat-not-burn device infringes our patents and that we are entitled among other things to an injunction against BAT sales cells of the device. Moving now to IQOS ILUMA. We are delighted to report the outstanding success since its launch in Japan and Switzerland with sales performance and consumer reaction exceeding our expectation. In Japan, the uptake of ILUMA devices and consumables among both existing IQOS users and legal-adult smoker has been rapid with more than 20% of the large user base switching since the August launch and over 20% of sales to legal age smokers due to IQOS. Moreover, the enhanced and consistently high-quality user experience, better reliability and no need for cleaning has led to significant observed increases in conversion rate, retention rate and Net Promoter Score. This bodes well for volume growth and indeed, premium-priced TEREA consumables have been the fastest-growing launch in the small free category reaching an offtake share in the three main convenience store shares change of 8% within three months of national launch and driving the growth of the heat-not-burn category following the October tax-driven price increase. Early results in Switzerland have been even more remarkable with over one-third of sales to new user and TEREA making up over one-third of HD sales after only two months of commercialization. Our HTU share growth has accelerated accordingly from 6% in September to 7.9% in December. These results are very encouraging for the wider rollout of ILUMA in the EU region and around the world, and we plan to roll out gradually to more markets this year, mostly in H2. While we continue to manage device supply constraints, the unprecedented growth in Japan also means we have had to accelerate both the supply of TEREA consumable using airfreight and the conversion of our production line to support new market launches. With ILUMA, IQOS 3 DUO and LIL, we now have three heat-not-burn technologies under the IQOS umbrella to serve different consumer needs and segment the market. We have an exciting pipeline of innovation on devices and consumables across our technology at different price tiers. As I mentioned, we also plan to enhance our portfolio for future growth with the introduction of a new complementary technology towards the end of this year. This will be targeted at smokers in low and middle income market, catering to the consumer need of simple high-quality, affordable devices and consumable and specific local test performances. In terms of HTUs, after launching over 15 new ILUMA SKUs in Q4, we plan to continue expanding our portfolio across platforms, geography and price point this year. We continue to commercialize IQOS VEEV with very promising results in the first group of markets where we started in our own channel with a limited range of test variants and nicotine levels. IQOS VEEV is a premium product, providing a superior experience and the commercial faster of IQOS allows us to deploy efficiently and our scale through a bespoke route-to-market approach. As we start to expand distribution and the consumable offering, we observed signs of increased uptake and clear positive consumer feedback relative to competitive product. We see encouraging success in Italy and the Czech Republic, reaching double-digit offtake shares of close to 10 points with rapid progress also visible in Croatia within three months of launch. After launching in Canada and Ukraine in the fourth quarter, we plan to add more markets in 2022 with timing subject to device availability. We also continued preparation to apply for a PMTA from the U.S. FDA and now prudently assume readiness for filing in early 2023, given further clarity on the required preparatory steps. An additional exciting midterm growth opportunity is in the nicotine pouch category, where we aim to become a leading player with a Shiro brand. Nicotine pouches provide convenient smoke-free alternative for adult smokers. And while still early in many markets, we see Shiro playing an important role in our smoke-free portfolio over the coming years. Following the acquisition of AG Snus and Fertin Pharma, we have established a base of product development and manufacturing expertise. Although we are still learning about the promising category, our IQOS commercial infrastructure allows for a fast rollout and we plan a number of launches over the coming quarters. The first major activity is the full re-launch of the revitalized Shiro portfolio in the Nordic this month from its more limited prior presence with full commercial activity and a broad portfolio of flavors and strength variance. Separately, following feedback from the 2021 consumer test of our Platform 2 carbon product, the design of our current technology has been discontinued. We are assessing alternative design for this consumer segment. Turning now to our nascent business beyond nicotine, the 2021 acquisitions of Fertin, Vectura and OtiTopic provide the base for building critical respiratory and overall product development capabilities in tandem with our existing expertise. This opened up opportunity to deliver the positive effect of existing wellness and health care molecules in a fast and effective manner. For the time being, our reported number in the other segment showed the existing acquired business, which delivered $101 million in net revenue in the fourth quarter and a marginal operating loss of $1 million. The underlying performance is in line with our expectation with reported operating expenses reflecting the amortization of intangible, deal-related items and our planned investments. Around 39% of Q4 revenue were derived from Fertin's smoking cessation product and nicotine pouch operations. While we intend to continue the CDMO activities of the acquired companies, the most significant value to PMI is in this ability to develop and commercialize new products in the wellness and healthcare segment over time. We plan important R&D investment over the course of the coming years to support the aim of delivering meaningful incremental revenue starting two to three years from now as we pursue our ambition of at least $1 billion of net revenue from wellness and healthcare products by 2025. As I mentioned earlier, we expect an operating loss of around $150 million in 2022, with revenue of around $250 million, including smoking cessation products. We recognized investor interest in our future product line in these new areas and plan to provide more color at our CAGNY conference presentation on February 23. Moving to sustainability and our ESG priorities, I'm happy to share that we recently completed a new sustainability feasibility assessment to update and recalibrate our priorities in accordance with our biggest impact on society, double maturity and extensive stakeholder inputs. While addressing the health impact of our product remained by far the biggest focus, we also identified a number of topics, which are emerging in importance or required an evolved approach. We will publish the results next week. It is increasingly important to align management incentives with sustainability materiality, performance and impact. We will strengthen this link in 2022 with the new sustainability index and plan to provide more details in the near future. Our progress on sustainability continues to be recognized by leading external stakeholders with repeated inclusion in both the Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America and the Bloomberg Generic-Quality Index, and receiving CDP's AAA score for the second year running. We also published an agricultural labor practices report, making 10-year -- marking 10 years of the program. Since its introduction, we have successfully eradicated systemic issue related to child labor, while improving living condition of farmers and farm workers. It also outlined our ambition targets such as 100% farmers supplying tobacco to PMI, making the leasing income by 2025. On our most critical priority of product impact, the grown penetration of smoke-free products around the world is accelerating the end of cigarettes as legal age smokers reach to better alternative. I am also pleased to report further recent positive regulatory development. For example, as part of its beating cancer plan, the European Parliament special committee recognized and featured harm reduction in its last report for which the plenary vote will take place next week. In New Zealand, the government published its more action plan, expressly excluding small free product from the proposed measures. In addition, the number of countries, including Poland and Russia have announced new multiyear excise tax plan with taxation of smoke-free products clearly differentiated from cigarettes, making 15 markets globally with such plans. There is a growing body of scientific and real-world evidence of the substantial reduction potential of smoke-free product compared with smoking. While challenges in some markets are to be expected, we continue to support regulatory and fiscal framework that recognize this critical harm reduction opportunity. I will now turn back to Jacek for some concluding remarks.\nJacek Olczak: Thank you, Emmanuel. Overall, we are very pleased to have delivered excellent growth in last year in 2021 with a strong underlying momentum for IQOS as well as the record adjusted EPS, net revenues and cash generation. In the consistent quality and sustainability of our organic top and bottom line delivery has been clearly demonstrated over the last two years, which I believe we all acknowledge with pretty to volunteers. With an improving outlook for device supply, although still were an element of agility, the exceptional initial success of ILUMA and the number of innovations and growth initiatives. We look forward to 2022 with a tremendous excitement. At the same time, we're building -- we will be building our development capabilities in wellness and healthcare for targeted investment in order to support the next driver of our long-term growth. Our balance sheet is strong, and we have increased cash returns to shareholders through a higher dividend and our share repurchase program, in line with our objective to deliver sustainable value and returns to investors as we continue our smoke-free transformation. In short, we continue to see a bright future of our business. Following a very strong 2021, we remain confident in our '21 to '23 growth targets and in our ambition to be majority smoke-free by net revenues in 2025. Thank you all for your attention. Emmanuel and myself will be happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference.  Our first question will come from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nBonnie Herzog: Hi, Jacek and Emmanuel. I hope you're both doing well. I have a question on your EPS guidance this year. It's quite a wide range at 8% to 11% on a currency-neutral basis. So I was hoping you could highlight some of the key assumptions or drivers that put you maybe at the low end of that range versus what needs to happen for you to get to the 11% growth? For instance, 11% is possible even if the chip shortage situation doesn't get resolved for the next few months?\nJacek Olczak: I think Emmanuel.\nEmmanuel Babeau: I'm going to take this. So, obviously, and we've been trying it in our preliminary remarks, we are still facing a number of uncertainties. The COVID does not disappear even if things seem to be improving. We don't have full visibility on the IT shortage and on the supply chain globally. And that is obviously what is behind with some certainly cautiousness on the guidance that we are giving on the top line. And then from there, we, of course, are driving a business that is seeing a good momentum. We have the traditional driver of price increase. We're going to be very efficient on cost savings. You can see what we've been delivering in 2021, already more than $800 million of efficiency on our cost. We're going to continue in 2022. And I know that is going to drive the difference between the revenue growth and the adjusted EPS organic growth. One of the headwinds that we're going to face this year, which I think we should see as very positive because it's coming from the growth, and we are managing a very nice potential of growth is that we are investing for exciting outlook. It starts, of course, with ILUMA in Japan, but globally, the launch of ILUMA, but certainly with a big impact in Japan, where we know that when we launch a new product, this is having some impact on the cost of goods because we are not at the same level in terms of efficiency on the supply chain. The productivity is not at its maximum, and we've been explaining that in our remarks. And that is going to have some impact at the launch. We talked about air freight as well and that is to have an impact. We said it with probably what we see today is a moderate decrease of the gross margin rate. Without that, it would have been from what we see today, another year of growth of the gross margin rate. But that's really what is driving the guidance. So we have some uncertainty, but we are very excited by the potential of growth that we see with all this innovation that is coming up. We have the traditional driver of efficiency that are going to help. We have some headwind, which was absolutely planned because we are coming with innovation, and we need to invest to launch this innovation. And I should add in terms of innovation, but it's certainly the fact that we are also expanding in terms of geography, what we see in Egypt bode extremely well for the potential in emerging countries, but we need to invest, of course, to build the capacity. We need to develop our commercial tools. We need to invest on the new platform, vaping and nicotine pouches. So what I think is great in this guidance and in our ambition for 2022 is that it's a year with a lot of investment for an exciting growth, but we are still able to deliver a good dynamic top line. We are able to deliver nice margin improvement, good organic growth at a good level. And as you have seen, we are hugely cash generative, and we do that at the same time, again, while investing for the future.\nBonnie Herzog: Okay. That's super helpful and honestly makes a lot of sense. So clearly, a lot of puts and takes, but you've got a lot of levers to pull. For my second question, I maybe wanted to switch gears a bit and just kind of asked a little bit about the situation in the U.S. and just maybe an update. It sounds like you expect to get back in the market next year with IQOS. So maybe love to hear a little more color on this. And will the build out of the production in the U.S., will that be your financial responsibility? And then Altria mentioned some issues between you two in terms of the agreement you have in their fourth quarter press release. So just was hoping to better understand what that could mean. For instance, I guess, Altria fails to meet the terms of the agreement, would you then pursue distribution of IQOS in the U.S. yourselves? And/or, I guess, find another distribution partner? Can you kind of walk through that for us? And then I'm thinking on tech of a potential solution for VEEV in the U.S., assuming it gets approved.\nJacek Olczak: Yes. So Bonnie, as we're working on the -- bringing the manufacturing capacity for IQOS on the U.S. territory. And that's our main mitigation plan or reaction plan to where we are today post the ITC event. As we said, we think that the summer at the beginning of the next year, we should be in a position to resume the shipments in the U.S. As we and the Altria is this close, we have some disagreements with regards whether Altria has fulfilled the certain milestones in the current contract, and we're currently in negotiations or discussions with Altria to resolve it. And so, I believe in a good faith, we should be finding some solutions. I wouldn't do know beyond speculating what other options and how we would approach the IQOS going forward in the U.S. I mean, our partner results, and I think we should see some amicable solution between both partners. Now I have said it on a number of occasions in the U.S. market is as a few other markets in which we have a very negligible and more presence of strategic importance. So obviously, you've heard us in the past, I believe that that pre-ITC ruling IQOS performance in U.S. and you know how we perform with IQOS across all essential geographies I mean it's really well below what I would expect at this stage or characterize the potential of IQOS. And if I take into this, the fact that this is then inhalable FDA authorized product, you don't really have a competition and the size of the market, et cetera, I think it's fair to say that the expectations were much beyond where we are today. But I will stop here and I believe we will find a good resolution, which will, on the one hand, enable the American smokers, cigarette smokers to have our access to that technology, and also something which will be accretive to us with the partners' results there.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Chris Growe with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nChris Growe: I just wanted to ask, first of all, on IQOS, and you had a nice acceleration in the number of IQOS users in the fourth quarter. I just want to -- and I know you talked about an acceleration of getting back to that roughly 1 million users sequentially. Can that not happen until the second half of '22? Or will supply be sufficient to where you could start to see that level of user growth in the first half of '22? I'm just trying to get a sense of that availability of devices to understand the growth in '22.\nJacek Olczak: Yes. Look, the Q4, reacceleration of coming back to the previous user growth is highly encouraging. I just confirmed that IQOS had that ability of a continued growth. Obviously, it's very much hinges on the fact that though we have unrestricted availability of the devices. And remember IQOS today has had a heat-not-burn propositions, which we have today consist of the few versions of IQOS blade product. I should mention real product coming through the other partnership with TMG and IQOS ILUMA. And all of that also rather create certain portfolio of proposition for the various target in the various consumers growth. So we regain a little bit of a flexibility of recomposing the full portfolio in Q4. And hence, Europe we've all seen the spectacular regain in the user acquisition. It is somehow reflected in our 4% to 6% growth target and the heated tobacco unit target for this year that for how many months or for many weeks in a year, we think we can have unrestricted access to the full product portfolio of the devices very much. I believe that actual IQOS can fly is higher if we're in the unrestricted moot, but some have in the product as for the next year, we should have bigger scenario, which is maybe more on the moderate side, et cetera. If this was the -- if we wouldn't have all these constraints coming from a device as a couple of other things in the supply chain, I believe would be looking at the different numbers. But at this stage, it's difficult to start taking this into something which we think we can we can deliver. So I think I'm saying the IQOS has a higher potential that growth rate, but when you really have to be the moment when we can go unconstrained. Needless to say that part of our growth is coming from Asia region. And although European Union was less than part of the one that you like, seems like it's moving COVID behind, we're still not at the stage in Japan and a few other locations. So we also have to start factoring this in. But I'm very optimistic that we can deliver 2022 and frankly speaking, knowing how much headwind we need to take on our test in 2022. I start looking actually excited about the '23.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Just to complement on your question on, can we reach 1 million. I think we are simply we see rather a ramp up today. It doesn't mean that we cannot reach 1 million in one of the quarter in H1, but it's true that we see a ramp-up and an acceleration as we go through the year.\nChris Growe: Okay. And I did just have a quick question on the U.S. to follow on Bonnie's question. Is there a scenario where you prevail on the patent office review that would allow you to start importing the product again before the first half of '23? So you're getting your supply chain ready in the U.S., but is there a chance that you could win on the patents and not -- and be able to import the product again?\nJacek Olczak: Well, there it. But the whole process is -- I think it deserves separate conversations about the patent laws and the processes around this whole thing and unfortunately, we have to cope with this. I mean, every, we prevail on the invalidation of some patents, obviously, the other party, in this case, if they have a right to repeal. So the whole process is really extended in time. And by -- you need another couple of years, frankly speaking, until you have when of the parties actually can claim the full victory. Then you have to go to the ITC and establish the restrictions, if you like, which are now imposed on us. I think the fastest -- absent any other resolutions, right, the fastest route back to the U.S. is reactivating that our domestic capacity and resupplying the market from that. And then maybe that later on, we are constrained, which means that the U.S. market could be supplied from the both international and from the domestic. But I think the near-term opportunity for us is to go the route which we discussed.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nPamela Kaufman: I have a question about your outlook for combustible pricing in 2022. Pricing in 2021 was below your historical rate of growth, given headwinds in Indonesia. But can you talk about your expectations for pricing, pricing environment in 2022? And how you're prioritizing price realization versus market share in combustibles?\nJacek Olczak: Yes. So we're looking for, as we said, we're looking at the 3% to 4% pricing variance this year, which is better, stronger than the last year. I think some Asian geographies to the variety of factors are still presumably driving as lower on what we think we could have normally realized a bit comparing at least to the historical trends we have there. Indonesia, you're absolutely rightly pointed out is on the negative, although the tax increases, which the industry has to pass on. I mean, give some hope that we can end up with that maybe Indonesia can return to that pricing is the important component of the growth there. But we also have to take it from the considerations of impact of recovery, the volumes and presumably talking more about the Philippines. We see how much of this thing we can unwind in 2022. And having reaching the benefits in '22 and how much we can build at a pace for '23. It's going in the right direction, but a bit of a more is needed. The last of the pricing environment, okay, so as difficult to predict, but as we characterize it's improving on all our geographies. And we have a pretty good visibility at this stage, obviously, about the taxes that is in the major volume or profit market to Emmanuel in his part of the remarks, was talking about this more and more countries are taking to the multiyear approach, which gives us better visibility and planning around. As you know, in some countries, the tax increases cannot be passed into consumers in one step. You need to have some preparatory, take some pricing before some pricing after -- so it is going into the right direction, especially if we take it in a context that every country, every market is having a huge pressure on the public finances due to the COVID situation, et cetera. So, I think we -- I mean, as far navigated pretty well there.\nPamela Kaufman: Right, thank you. My second question is on ILUMA uptake. And if you can provide some more color on how much of the new user growth in Japan has been driven by ILUMA for IQOS? And what observations you have around the user base and the interaction with prior versions of IQOS?\nJacek Olczak: Yes. So -- but you might have -- if I remember that from the very beginning of ILUMA was personally very excited about that innovation. And I am so happy that it delivers on my expectations, actually is not even beating by expectations. So I will continue if you allow me to present enthusiastic voice. ILUMA does generate, obviously, the IQOS user, Blade product users, you appreciate the benefit of ILUMA the first moment, you have it in your hands and you have your fist experience. And the response from the consumers in Japan is phenomenal. Obviously, the ILUMA goes to the existing users, but we also already having the benefit of existing IQOS users switching to ILUMA because they have uninterrupted consumption during every moment a day when they or they're willing to use the product. And this also has an impact on the volumes. In other sense, if I give you the device, which is much more informative to use, reliable, much, much, much more reliable, you will have a tendency to increase the consumption versus what you have on a blade, we the patients failed to allow for having that experience. So that's a very good thing. Second thing is ILUMA, after all of these initial months, we observed a very solid higher level of conversions. And if you know, it is a very important component in the business model. I have many devices will fully convert smokers combustible smokers. How many of them will stay because it releases the pressure going forward also on the margins, et cetera. And the third one is, at this stage, I remember the number likely about 20% of the user of the ILUMA cells is coming from the people who are never in the category, not in cost. And also what I start serving recently, you also start taking back users who have temporary and migrated from IQOS to competitive products. So in whatever aspect of performance of ILUMA look like, it really delivers on every axis. So the question is again, and I know that for some might be body, do we have availability of the devices? And can we continue supplying the market and the rest, I believe so far so far is really going in the right direction.\nOperator: We'll take your next question from Vivian Azer with Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nVivien Azer: My first question is on pricing. Certainly encouraging to hear that your outlook for 2022 contemplate an improvement in pricing relative to last year, I was wondering, however, if you could just comment on how you're thinking about price gap management between your combustible cigarettes and your heated tobacco units, please?\nJacek Olczak: Well, we essentially, in most or all markets, we maintain the same sort of a positioning of IQOS today versus the cost of combustible reference point. As you know, most of the tax systems actually have that conversion mechanism baked in. So if there is a tax increase on a combustible somehow proportionally this triggers the increase on the heated tobacco units, which translates at the consumer price gaps essentially untouched. We obviously complement depend on the market situation, our portfolio, for example, KT&G, the real proposition and I think it works very nicely, especially in the geographies when IQOS reaches the levels which are above, for example, premium -- equivalent of the premium price segment in the combustible market. So we need to take affordability to the equation as well, so instead of doing something about the pricing of IQOS and the heats. We're actually expanding the portfolio to the below, but also to the above in some geographies when we think there is a bus premium versus IQOS versus heat that the opportunity. We did it very successfully in Russia in a few European markets. So I think the whole thing is that the broader we have a portfolio of horizontally from a price perspective and vertically from taste, flavor, et cetera, perspective, we're increasingly creating more attractiveness for the cigarette smokers to switch to heat-not-burn.\nVivien Azer: Perfect. And my follow-up question decision to discontinue Platform 2 TEEPS. Certainly, that product has been under evaluation for a number of years. And I was just curious to hear kind of the key take away from the consumer test. Is the problem that consumers are using a live heat force, and that's just creating a lot of confusion in terms of the reduced risk proposition? Was it product performance? Just any other color would be helpful.\nJacek Olczak: Now actually, I think that like allow me the language, it was more on the user interface rather than anything else. I don't think the past the number of the market test the proposition, the livability of the propositions in terms of the -- is the better alternative to smoking and everything goes there. The issue actually pertains to the heat pipe. As you remember, the design at the very end of the cigarette-like looking product, you have the heat size, which requires lighting, okay? And this was -- to face open this from the paper cup lighting this. And that is the question, how you extinguish the product, right, because you need to pay attention how you extinguish the product. And this was actually in our opinion, what the consumers' opinion actually, not the leading to that adoption levels, which we would wish to have an especially comparing our experience from other platforms and the mainly T1 platform. So I think we reached the moment the design of that product and this part of the technology around the heat source and operating asking the consumers, how the intern operate around this whole thing led us to the conclusion that we are seeing that design component we shut down. And I think still the proposition makes sense is understood by the consumer has the potential, but we cannot offer the product to the consumers, which they will not find convenient to use. And the convenience is either name of what the consumers want these days, and I think we need to deliver on this one, especially that our ambitions would be to also leverage the equity, which we build around the IQOS, and IQOS cannot afford product, which has this one. So I think we will come back one day to the P2. From the very beginning, you may recall our annually Investors Day when we start talking about the vision of growing smoke-free and how many platforms will be needed to compare the 1 billion small cars worldwide. This is a proposition which is more for the more conservative audience, the people who really don't want to completely walk away from the ritual experience when the combustible cigarettes are delivering. So I think in terms of our growth prospects for the item I don't think it's that much of an issue that we will be working on that by using a different approach to the design and the technology going forward, going forward. So I hope it answers your question, Vivien.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Gaurav Jain with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nGaurav Jain: So I have a couple of questions. So first one is on your guidance. So your volume growth is minus 1:1. You are saying cigarette pricing will be three to four. And then category price mix in that slide that you have, it is plus three, assuming it is a three. So it should come to plus 5% to plus 8% on revenue growth for FY '22, but you are saying 4% to 6%. So that will imply that the category mix uplift will be less in FY '22 than was the case in FY '21. So can you just help us understand why that will be the case.\nJacek Olczak: I'm happy to try to add to, Gaurav, certainly what we are expecting in 2022 is to have another very nice difference between the volume growth and the revenue growth. And indeed, for the volume, we've been guiding to -- from minus 1% to plus 1%. So then the question is how much are we going to generate in terms of extra growth, there is this price where we have in 2% to 4%. Remember, we've done 2.7% in 2021. So, the low end of the bracket is not massively above what we did in 2021. But it's true that it could be better, and it's certainly something that we are factoring in the high end. And then there is impact of the growth of the IQOS business and it's on category where we have this positive mix impact that is playing. But here, the mix and with the launch in many new economies and new geographies and emerging country that is potentially having an impact on the differential. So, we do expect a very strong differential again, but not necessarily at the same level as the difference that we generated in 2021. Last but not least, we referred to the fact that we have, at the beginning, and its temporary higher weight on the consumables for IQOS ILUMA Ontario. And this is having an impact because the excise duty in the country where the excise duty, are based on weight is higher, and therefore, because we are coming with the same price for the consumable than it. That can generate when we have a switch but temporary. Again, I see from the fact that it's temporary, decrease -- a slight decrease on per steak. So that can have an impact as well. So that is really what you're going to have plus potentially some impact on the price which will depend on the volume of the device that we sell also on the mix of the device that we sell and also on the commercial aggressiveness that we want to have on the price of the device. So you have to take a number of things into account. Now at the end of the day, as you can see between the minus 1% to plus-1% and the 4% to 6%, we are definitely targeting to have another year with a very nice differential between volume and organic revenue growth, which is exactly how we end up.\nGaurav Jain: Okay. That's very helpful. And my second question is on the beyond nicotine segment where you will have $150 million of operating losses this year and you make also the comment that you will invest in it in future years so that you can hit the $1 billion revenue target. So does it mean that the losses we should expect to be higher in FY '23 than what they will be in FY '22? Or when could we expect that segment to break even?\nJacek Olczak: Well, I think there will be an investment for the next few years, not a couple but a few years, which we are willing to do. I think if you stay with us and wait until the CAGNY when we will give you more insight of what we have, what is our thinking about is beyond nicotine wellness and healthcare business because then we will be in a position to show which products, concrete products or programs we're willing to go after what is the size of an opportunity and what sort of investment is in terms. But I think the number which we gave for this year, for 2022 in the guidance, about the ballpark sort of the investment, which we will be calling for the couple of years.\nEmmanuel Babeau: It's not a one-off. It could go a bit higher, but I don't expect an explosion here. I think you have a good calibration of the cutout that we're going to invest over a few years.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jared Dinges with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJared Dinges: First, I want to touch a bit more on the nicotine pouches. How should we be thinking about the scale of that initial launch in the Nordics? And how should we think about the future market launches that you guys touched on a bit? Are you considering launching nicotine pouches in markets maybe that don't have a nicotine pouch presence today, like some of your emerging markets? And also, just looking at the potential in the U.S., would you consider a PMT application there as well?\nJacek Olczak: Yes, I would leave the U.S. aside for a second. I think nicotine pouches can play a very important role in, if you like the smoking smokers, okay? They demonstrated their variability that has that proposition in many markets. Initially, we're essentially taking share as we acquire this. And after remaking of the product and the packaging, et cetera, we'll go in the market when there was some sales of a share, obviously, not very high, but we start where we already were present. And we build on this as always, in our innovations who will look at the consumers' feedback see what else we have to improve. And we also have some product pipeline behind the initial offering which we now could accelerate to the large extent, thanks to the acquisition of the therapy. Now, Fertin gives us much broader opportunities than just the pouches because Fertin seats on the very interesting delivery systems in -- for the oral delivery. And we know that Fertin is the manufacturer of the nicotine replacement therapies like the gums, nicotine gums, but they also have interesting other technologies. So, we will be thinking we start with the pouches, but I think over a period of time, 2022. i think the oral way of delivering nicotine as a substitute to smoking is actually a very attractive opportunity, which we are very excited to start working on. So, we will go into the geographies, obviously, when the pouches are not present today. I mean, as you know, we have a geographical footprint in addition to this 70-plus markets where they have acquired quite a meaningful IQOS infrastructure. You're back in the shops, you're back in digital. You're having one in CRM, commercial consumer engagement. I believe we can start adding to that our portfolio of the propositions to smokers to the oral category -- broader oral category than just the pouches. So we focus this year on the pouches. We will be extending the presence, but I think that is more than just the pouches and the very pleased that we concluded the acquisition of rating because it gives us -- it accelerates our development by a quite good few years, which others would have to take organically.\nJared Dinges: Got it. So just to follow up on that. So you would consider the U.S. PMT application?\nJacek Olczak: I think I answered that question to Bonnie. U.S. is a very attractive market, and I believe this other strategic importance to us. And I do believe that in the market of the size of the U.S., we need to have all platforms, frankly speaking, because of the one platform which can guarantee the full success of proceeding of an opportunity. So ultimately, yes, but our focus today is somewhere else.\nJared Dinges: Got it. And the second one, going back towards cigarettes and IQOS. Are you guys worried at all about potential impacts of price elasticity especially with lower income consumers given the inflationary environment and where you guys are positioned in most markets, and we're usually more at the premium end. So maybe you can give a comment on that?\nJacek Olczak: Yes. So the price elasticity is always the concern, and as we know very well, sometimes is price elasticity on the tobacco nicotine product is elevated due to the pressures or income pressures on the consumers. So, we're now having that situation in a few markets that consumers have a pressure on the income. I mean I believe some of these pressures will unwind as the COVID will be becoming a sort of the past and I don't think it's anything systemic. It's very interesting you're asking this question because if we look in the market where we're taking pricing on cigarettes and the HeatSticks and the market has a pretty robust set of data from the past increases. I think today, products like IQOS or alternatives to smoking, tends to have a better elasticity, price elasticity than the conventional cigarette. And as you know, I guess, very well, the price elasticity on cigarettes and discard by other factors was pretty attractive, and this was a part of the building as a business model. And actually, at this stage, looks with alternative even for the -- not high but better elasticity than a combustible cigarette. Separately, not from the elasticity perspective, but from the pure affordability perspective, we were already pretty successful with IQOS in the so-called low middle income countries. But we also know that in order to make the more significant inroads. We need to come with the proposition, which directly addresses the need below-price, price segment. And we will not deliver the smokers behind alone. And before the end of this year, we having the plans to test another technology which would allow for the both devices and consumables to be more accessible from an affordability perspective, while there we're going to have reduction potential as I course as we know it today. So, we're taking those things into the very serious consideration. So thank you for your question.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the management team for any closing remarks.\nJacek Olczak: Well, this was a call longer than expected, but we also delivered the results last year better than we expected. I think somehow we match it. Thank you very much for your attention. We invite you to our CAGNY presentation, which will be in a position to give the more light, more details on the few aspects like what we discussed today, wellness healthcare, but also how we look here in a much broader in terms of the development of these categories. And I think we got filling in our, my voice and Emmanuel's voice how excited we are that '21, we delivered in that shape and form. And despite the number of headwinds, which I believe we articulate pretty well. We're still looking into the very successful and rewarding for both of us 2022. So thank you very much for your attention and hope to see most of you, if not all the recovered CAGNY presentation. Thank you, all.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you all. See you soon.\nNick Rolli: Thank you very much. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations team, and just a reminder that the slides and scripts are available on the PMI website. Thank you very much. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's Philip Morris International fourth quarter 2021 year-end earnings conference call. At this time, you may disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Jacek Olczak",
            "content": "Thank you, Nick, and welcome, everyone. I hope you all say on well. Our business delivered an excellent performance in 2021, reaching record net revenues, adjusted diluted EPS and cash flow with growth in overall volumes, high single-digit organic net revenue growth and strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth. This illustrates the sustainable nature of our growth based on new products and innovation, as demonstrated by the continued strength of IQOS, which delivered 31% full year organic growth in RRP net revenues. Smoke-free products surpassed 30% of total net revenues in Q4, as we progress towards our ambition of becoming a predominantly smoke-free company by 2025. We were especially pleased by the reacceleration of our business in Q4 to deliver a better-than-expected result. This reacceleration was visible in organic net revenues, IQOS user growth, heated tobacco unit market shares across developed and emerging markets, innovation in devices and consumables, and commercial investments and combustible share. IQOS user growth recovered in Q4 to reach an estimated 21.2 million total users, despite ongoing tightness in device supplies in the second half of the year. Full year heated tobacco unit shipment volumes grew 25% to reach 95 billion units, with broad-based growth for both our volumes and the category across key geographies, with an especially positive rebound in the EU. The growth outlook for IQOS remains very positive, with outstanding initial results from IQOS ILUMA in Japan and Switzerland, the only two launches so far, and growing traction for IQOS VEEV in early launch markets. In combustibles, we essentially reached our goal of stable category share in the fourth quarter despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization. During the year, we laid the foundations for our long-term growth ambitions beyond nicotine in Wellness and Healthcare, including the milestone acquisitions of Fertin and Vectura, which provide essential capabilities for future product development. And last, bolstered by strong operating cash flow, we continued to prioritize returns to shareholders through a 4.2% increase in the dividend and ongoing share repurchases. Turning to the headline numbers. Our full year adjusted net revenues grew organically by 7.6% or 10.3% in dollar terms, including positive currency. This reflects the continued underlying strength of IQOS and the ongoing recovery of the combustible business in many markets compared to the pandemic affected prior year. Our net revenue per unit grew 5.3% organically driven by the increasing proportion of IQOS in our sales mix and pricing. Combustible pricing was in line with our expectations at 2.7% or around 4%, excluding Indonesia. Our adjusted operating income margin increased by 200 basis points on an organic basis, in line with our expectations, with continued positive effects from the increasing size and profitability of IQOS, pricing and productivity savings. Through first half expansion -- although strong H1 expansion was tempered in the second half by the expected initial higher unit cost of IQOS ILUMA, geographic and category expansion investment and the Q4 resumption of consumer programs in a number of markets. Our resulting adjusted diluted EPS of $6.08 represents 17.6% growth in dollar terms and 15.3% currency-neutral growth, which is well above our prior guidance as IQOS user growth, the launch of Illuma and total industry volumes exceeded our expectations. Finally, we generated operating cash flow of $12 billion, reflecting excellent underlying cash conversion in addition to strong Q4 business results and certain timing factors. Looking at our Q4 performance, net revenues grew by 8.4% organically. This reflects the sequential improvement in IQOS user acquisition the initial success of ILUMA in Japan and strong overall volumes, including a further recovery in combustibles. We delivered robust organic net revenue per unit growth of 4.1%, again reflecting our shift in business mix. We achieved this despite softer pricing on combustibles of 1.4% due to the factors flagged previously of continued pandemic-related challenges in certain markets as well as comparison effects in Germany and Australia. Our Q4 adjusted operating income margin declined by 10 basis points on an organic basis, primarily due to the same factors mentioned for the second half as accelerating business performance opened more opportunities for investment in future growth. Despite that, our currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS, again grew strongly by 11.9%, also reflecting a lower interest cost and effective tax rate. Turning now to 2022 guidance. After the temporary slowdown in IQOS user growth in the second half of 2021, the device supply situation is gradually improving. While the situation remains fluid, we now expect a more limited impact, allowing us to gradually return to prior rates of user progression over the coming quarters. With the remarkable success of ILUMA in its first market, a number of other innovations planned and promising growth for IQOS in low and middle income markets, our 2022 growth fundamentals are strong, and we look forward to an exciting year. We note that the slower user growth in the second half of 2021, particularly in the third quarter, will have an estimated carryover effect on our growth this year of around 4 billion to 5 billion cubic tobacco units. This is reflected in our 2022 expectations of 113 million to 118 billion H2 shipment volume. Given this continued growth, we expect our full year H2 shipments to again be ahead of IMS volumes. We expect to deliver between 4% and 6% organic net revenue growth keeping us well on track to deliver our 2021 -- 2021, 2023 compound annual growth rate target of more than 5%. This range prudently incorporates the continuing uncertainty on full device availability and the pace of the ongoing pandemic recovery. For Duty Free, we assume no meaningful pickup in Asian travel, but a continued gradual recovery in other geographies. We expect our adjusted operating income margin to expand between 50 and 150 basis points as the positive effects of our product transformation continues, despite the expectation of a moderately lower gross margin. This is essentially attributable to temporary ILUMA related factors such as the higher initial weight and cost of TEREA consumables and the cost of devices, which we expect to decrease over the 18 to 24 months post-launch as we have experienced in previous -- with previous major innovations. We also account for higher logistic costs, where the tremendous uptake of ILUMA in Japan has led to increased use of air freight investments to grow capacity across our smoke-free platforms and inflation in certain supply chain elements. Operating income margin expansion and continued growth opportunities and in wellness and healthcare R&D will again be supported by our ongoing efficiency programs. We remain on track to deliver around $2 billion in gross savings by 2023. Accordingly, we forecast currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of 8% to 11%. This translates into an adjusted diluted EPS range of $6.12 to $6.30, including an estimated unfavorable currency impact of around $0.45 at prevailing rates. This is primarily due to translation effects, and this currency impact reflects notably the appreciation of the euro, Japanese yen and Turkish lira versus the dollar. This guidance includes the impact of $785 million of share repurchases made in 2021, which were somewhat restricted by blackout periods. It does not reflect the impact of repurchases in 2022 as we continue to take an opportunistic approach within our target of between $5 billion to $7 billion over three years. Our guidance also reflects the impact of acquired businesses, which we expect to generate underlying operating income in line with our business plan, but with an operating loss of around $150 million or approximately 1% of adjusted diluted EPS, which we'll come back to explain later. As outlined in today's release, there are a number of other assumptions underpinning our outlook. We expect the total industry volume of cigarettes and to cubic tobacco units, excluding the U.S. and China to decline between minus 1% and minus 2%. Given our leadership in smoke-free product, the structural growth of the category and its growing proportion in our business, we expect to gain share a target broadly stable total PMI shipment volumes within the range of minus 1% to plus 1%. We assume full year combustible pricing of 3% to 4% with a softer first half and a stronger second half of the year. And this is clearly above 2021 levels. The pricing environment is improving but still challenging central markets with ongoing pandemic related impacts. Our balance sheet is strong. We delivered excellent operating cash flow of $12 billion in 2021, reflecting robust underlying cash conversion in addition to favorable timing and one-off impact of around $0.5 billion. With further strong organic profit growth expected in 2022, we expect to generate around $11 billion of operating cash flow, subject to year-end working capital requirements and after accounting for the reversal of timing benefits and using prevailing exchange rates. As a result, we raised our 2021 to '23 operating cash flow target communicated at the February 2021 Investor Day at $35 billion to the range of $36 billion to $37 billion. We also expect full year capital expenditures of around $1 billion, reflecting increased capacity investments behind our smoke-free platforms, including ILUMA and enhancing our digital commercial engine in addition to certain projects, which were delayed due to the pandemic. Lastly, looking specifically to the first quarter of 2022, we expect adjusted diluted EPS of $1.50 to $1.55, including $0.15 of unfavorable currency at prevailing rates. We expect robust organic top line growth and operating margins comparisons, which reflect above the very strong prior year quarter, which benefited from a high level of productivity savings and relatively low levels of investment and the Q1 of 2022 dynamics of commercial investments, ILUMA related costs and increases in some inputs such as freight. Let me now hand over to Emmanuel, who will give you more details of our performance in 2021. Thank you, Emmanuel. Overall, we are very pleased to have delivered excellent growth in last year in 2021 with a strong underlying momentum for IQOS as well as the record adjusted EPS, net revenues and cash generation. In the consistent quality and sustainability of our organic top and bottom line delivery has been clearly demonstrated over the last two years, which I believe we all acknowledge with pretty to volunteers. With an improving outlook for device supply, although still were an element of agility, the exceptional initial success of ILUMA and the number of innovations and growth initiatives. We look forward to 2022 with a tremendous excitement. At the same time, we're building -- we will be building our development capabilities in wellness and healthcare for targeted investment in order to support the next driver of our long-term growth. Our balance sheet is strong, and we have increased cash returns to shareholders through a higher dividend and our share repurchase program, in line with our objective to deliver sustainable value and returns to investors as we continue our smoke-free transformation. In short, we continue to see a bright future of our business. Following a very strong 2021, we remain confident in our '21 to '23 growth targets and in our ambition to be majority smoke-free by net revenues in 2025. Thank you all for your attention. Emmanuel and myself will be happy to answer your questions. I think Emmanuel. Yes. So Bonnie, as we're working on the -- bringing the manufacturing capacity for IQOS on the U.S. territory. And that's our main mitigation plan or reaction plan to where we are today post the ITC event. As we said, we think that the summer at the beginning of the next year, we should be in a position to resume the shipments in the U.S. As we and the Altria is this close, we have some disagreements with regards whether Altria has fulfilled the certain milestones in the current contract, and we're currently in negotiations or discussions with Altria to resolve it. And so, I believe in a good faith, we should be finding some solutions. I wouldn't do know beyond speculating what other options and how we would approach the IQOS going forward in the U.S. I mean, our partner results, and I think we should see some amicable solution between both partners. Now I have said it on a number of occasions in the U.S. market is as a few other markets in which we have a very negligible and more presence of strategic importance. So obviously, you've heard us in the past, I believe that that pre-ITC ruling IQOS performance in U.S. and you know how we perform with IQOS across all essential geographies I mean it's really well below what I would expect at this stage or characterize the potential of IQOS. And if I take into this, the fact that this is then inhalable FDA authorized product, you don't really have a competition and the size of the market, et cetera, I think it's fair to say that the expectations were much beyond where we are today. But I will stop here and I believe we will find a good resolution, which will, on the one hand, enable the American smokers, cigarette smokers to have our access to that technology, and also something which will be accretive to us with the partners' results there. Yes. Look, the Q4, reacceleration of coming back to the previous user growth is highly encouraging. I just confirmed that IQOS had that ability of a continued growth. Obviously, it's very much hinges on the fact that though we have unrestricted availability of the devices. And remember IQOS today has had a heat-not-burn propositions, which we have today consist of the few versions of IQOS blade product. I should mention real product coming through the other partnership with TMG and IQOS ILUMA. And all of that also rather create certain portfolio of proposition for the various target in the various consumers growth. So we regain a little bit of a flexibility of recomposing the full portfolio in Q4. And hence, Europe we've all seen the spectacular regain in the user acquisition. It is somehow reflected in our 4% to 6% growth target and the heated tobacco unit target for this year that for how many months or for many weeks in a year, we think we can have unrestricted access to the full product portfolio of the devices very much. I believe that actual IQOS can fly is higher if we're in the unrestricted moot, but some have in the product as for the next year, we should have bigger scenario, which is maybe more on the moderate side, et cetera. If this was the -- if we wouldn't have all these constraints coming from a device as a couple of other things in the supply chain, I believe would be looking at the different numbers. But at this stage, it's difficult to start taking this into something which we think we can we can deliver. So I think I'm saying the IQOS has a higher potential that growth rate, but when you really have to be the moment when we can go unconstrained. Needless to say that part of our growth is coming from Asia region. And although European Union was less than part of the one that you like, seems like it's moving COVID behind, we're still not at the stage in Japan and a few other locations. So we also have to start factoring this in. But I'm very optimistic that we can deliver 2022 and frankly speaking, knowing how much headwind we need to take on our test in 2022. I start looking actually excited about the '23. Well, there it. But the whole process is -- I think it deserves separate conversations about the patent laws and the processes around this whole thing and unfortunately, we have to cope with this. I mean, every, we prevail on the invalidation of some patents, obviously, the other party, in this case, if they have a right to repeal. So the whole process is really extended in time. And by -- you need another couple of years, frankly speaking, until you have when of the parties actually can claim the full victory. Then you have to go to the ITC and establish the restrictions, if you like, which are now imposed on us. I think the fastest -- absent any other resolutions, right, the fastest route back to the U.S. is reactivating that our domestic capacity and resupplying the market from that. And then maybe that later on, we are constrained, which means that the U.S. market could be supplied from the both international and from the domestic. But I think the near-term opportunity for us is to go the route which we discussed. Yes. So we're looking for, as we said, we're looking at the 3% to 4% pricing variance this year, which is better, stronger than the last year. I think some Asian geographies to the variety of factors are still presumably driving as lower on what we think we could have normally realized a bit comparing at least to the historical trends we have there. Indonesia, you're absolutely rightly pointed out is on the negative, although the tax increases, which the industry has to pass on. I mean, give some hope that we can end up with that maybe Indonesia can return to that pricing is the important component of the growth there. But we also have to take it from the considerations of impact of recovery, the volumes and presumably talking more about the Philippines. We see how much of this thing we can unwind in 2022. And having reaching the benefits in '22 and how much we can build at a pace for '23. It's going in the right direction, but a bit of a more is needed. The last of the pricing environment, okay, so as difficult to predict, but as we characterize it's improving on all our geographies. And we have a pretty good visibility at this stage, obviously, about the taxes that is in the major volume or profit market to Emmanuel in his part of the remarks, was talking about this more and more countries are taking to the multiyear approach, which gives us better visibility and planning around. As you know, in some countries, the tax increases cannot be passed into consumers in one step. You need to have some preparatory, take some pricing before some pricing after -- so it is going into the right direction, especially if we take it in a context that every country, every market is having a huge pressure on the public finances due to the COVID situation, et cetera. So, I think we -- I mean, as far navigated pretty well there. Yes. So -- but you might have -- if I remember that from the very beginning of ILUMA was personally very excited about that innovation. And I am so happy that it delivers on my expectations, actually is not even beating by expectations. So I will continue if you allow me to present enthusiastic voice. ILUMA does generate, obviously, the IQOS user, Blade product users, you appreciate the benefit of ILUMA the first moment, you have it in your hands and you have your fist experience. And the response from the consumers in Japan is phenomenal. Obviously, the ILUMA goes to the existing users, but we also already having the benefit of existing IQOS users switching to ILUMA because they have uninterrupted consumption during every moment a day when they or they're willing to use the product. And this also has an impact on the volumes. In other sense, if I give you the device, which is much more informative to use, reliable, much, much, much more reliable, you will have a tendency to increase the consumption versus what you have on a blade, we the patients failed to allow for having that experience. So that's a very good thing. Second thing is ILUMA, after all of these initial months, we observed a very solid higher level of conversions. And if you know, it is a very important component in the business model. I have many devices will fully convert smokers combustible smokers. How many of them will stay because it releases the pressure going forward also on the margins, et cetera. And the third one is, at this stage, I remember the number likely about 20% of the user of the ILUMA cells is coming from the people who are never in the category, not in cost. And also what I start serving recently, you also start taking back users who have temporary and migrated from IQOS to competitive products. So in whatever aspect of performance of ILUMA look like, it really delivers on every axis. So the question is again, and I know that for some might be body, do we have availability of the devices? And can we continue supplying the market and the rest, I believe so far so far is really going in the right direction. Well, we essentially, in most or all markets, we maintain the same sort of a positioning of IQOS today versus the cost of combustible reference point. As you know, most of the tax systems actually have that conversion mechanism baked in. So if there is a tax increase on a combustible somehow proportionally this triggers the increase on the heated tobacco units, which translates at the consumer price gaps essentially untouched. We obviously complement depend on the market situation, our portfolio, for example, KT&G, the real proposition and I think it works very nicely, especially in the geographies when IQOS reaches the levels which are above, for example, premium -- equivalent of the premium price segment in the combustible market. So we need to take affordability to the equation as well, so instead of doing something about the pricing of IQOS and the heats. We're actually expanding the portfolio to the below, but also to the above in some geographies when we think there is a bus premium versus IQOS versus heat that the opportunity. We did it very successfully in Russia in a few European markets. So I think the whole thing is that the broader we have a portfolio of horizontally from a price perspective and vertically from taste, flavor, et cetera, perspective, we're increasingly creating more attractiveness for the cigarette smokers to switch to heat-not-burn. Now actually, I think that like allow me the language, it was more on the user interface rather than anything else. I don't think the past the number of the market test the proposition, the livability of the propositions in terms of the -- is the better alternative to smoking and everything goes there. The issue actually pertains to the heat pipe. As you remember, the design at the very end of the cigarette-like looking product, you have the heat size, which requires lighting, okay? And this was -- to face open this from the paper cup lighting this. And that is the question, how you extinguish the product, right, because you need to pay attention how you extinguish the product. And this was actually in our opinion, what the consumers' opinion actually, not the leading to that adoption levels, which we would wish to have an especially comparing our experience from other platforms and the mainly T1 platform. So I think we reached the moment the design of that product and this part of the technology around the heat source and operating asking the consumers, how the intern operate around this whole thing led us to the conclusion that we are seeing that design component we shut down. And I think still the proposition makes sense is understood by the consumer has the potential, but we cannot offer the product to the consumers, which they will not find convenient to use. And the convenience is either name of what the consumers want these days, and I think we need to deliver on this one, especially that our ambitions would be to also leverage the equity, which we build around the IQOS, and IQOS cannot afford product, which has this one. So I think we will come back one day to the P2. From the very beginning, you may recall our annually Investors Day when we start talking about the vision of growing smoke-free and how many platforms will be needed to compare the 1 billion small cars worldwide. This is a proposition which is more for the more conservative audience, the people who really don't want to completely walk away from the ritual experience when the combustible cigarettes are delivering. So I think in terms of our growth prospects for the item I don't think it's that much of an issue that we will be working on that by using a different approach to the design and the technology going forward, going forward. So I hope it answers your question, Vivien. I'm happy to try to add to, Gaurav, certainly what we are expecting in 2022 is to have another very nice difference between the volume growth and the revenue growth. And indeed, for the volume, we've been guiding to -- from minus 1% to plus 1%. So then the question is how much are we going to generate in terms of extra growth, there is this price where we have in 2% to 4%. Remember, we've done 2.7% in 2021. So, the low end of the bracket is not massively above what we did in 2021. But it's true that it could be better, and it's certainly something that we are factoring in the high end. And then there is impact of the growth of the IQOS business and it's on category where we have this positive mix impact that is playing. But here, the mix and with the launch in many new economies and new geographies and emerging country that is potentially having an impact on the differential. So, we do expect a very strong differential again, but not necessarily at the same level as the difference that we generated in 2021. Last but not least, we referred to the fact that we have, at the beginning, and its temporary higher weight on the consumables for IQOS ILUMA Ontario. And this is having an impact because the excise duty in the country where the excise duty, are based on weight is higher, and therefore, because we are coming with the same price for the consumable than it. That can generate when we have a switch but temporary. Again, I see from the fact that it's temporary, decrease -- a slight decrease on per steak. So that can have an impact as well. So that is really what you're going to have plus potentially some impact on the price which will depend on the volume of the device that we sell also on the mix of the device that we sell and also on the commercial aggressiveness that we want to have on the price of the device. So you have to take a number of things into account. Now at the end of the day, as you can see between the minus 1% to plus-1% and the 4% to 6%, we are definitely targeting to have another year with a very nice differential between volume and organic revenue growth, which is exactly how we end up. Well, I think there will be an investment for the next few years, not a couple but a few years, which we are willing to do. I think if you stay with us and wait until the CAGNY when we will give you more insight of what we have, what is our thinking about is beyond nicotine wellness and healthcare business because then we will be in a position to show which products, concrete products or programs we're willing to go after what is the size of an opportunity and what sort of investment is in terms. But I think the number which we gave for this year, for 2022 in the guidance, about the ballpark sort of the investment, which we will be calling for the couple of years. Yes, I would leave the U.S. aside for a second. I think nicotine pouches can play a very important role in, if you like the smoking smokers, okay? They demonstrated their variability that has that proposition in many markets. Initially, we're essentially taking share as we acquire this. And after remaking of the product and the packaging, et cetera, we'll go in the market when there was some sales of a share, obviously, not very high, but we start where we already were present. And we build on this as always, in our innovations who will look at the consumers' feedback see what else we have to improve. And we also have some product pipeline behind the initial offering which we now could accelerate to the large extent, thanks to the acquisition of the therapy. Now, Fertin gives us much broader opportunities than just the pouches because Fertin seats on the very interesting delivery systems in -- for the oral delivery. And we know that Fertin is the manufacturer of the nicotine replacement therapies like the gums, nicotine gums, but they also have interesting other technologies. So, we will be thinking we start with the pouches, but I think over a period of time, 2022. i think the oral way of delivering nicotine as a substitute to smoking is actually a very attractive opportunity, which we are very excited to start working on. So, we will go into the geographies, obviously, when the pouches are not present today. I mean, as you know, we have a geographical footprint in addition to this 70-plus markets where they have acquired quite a meaningful IQOS infrastructure. You're back in the shops, you're back in digital. You're having one in CRM, commercial consumer engagement. I believe we can start adding to that our portfolio of the propositions to smokers to the oral category -- broader oral category than just the pouches. So we focus this year on the pouches. We will be extending the presence, but I think that is more than just the pouches and the very pleased that we concluded the acquisition of rating because it gives us -- it accelerates our development by a quite good few years, which others would have to take organically. I think I answered that question to Bonnie. U.S. is a very attractive market, and I believe this other strategic importance to us. And I do believe that in the market of the size of the U.S., we need to have all platforms, frankly speaking, because of the one platform which can guarantee the full success of proceeding of an opportunity. So ultimately, yes, but our focus today is somewhere else. Yes. So the price elasticity is always the concern, and as we know very well, sometimes is price elasticity on the tobacco nicotine product is elevated due to the pressures or income pressures on the consumers. So, we're now having that situation in a few markets that consumers have a pressure on the income. I mean I believe some of these pressures will unwind as the COVID will be becoming a sort of the past and I don't think it's anything systemic. It's very interesting you're asking this question because if we look in the market where we're taking pricing on cigarettes and the HeatSticks and the market has a pretty robust set of data from the past increases. I think today, products like IQOS or alternatives to smoking, tends to have a better elasticity, price elasticity than the conventional cigarette. And as you know, I guess, very well, the price elasticity on cigarettes and discard by other factors was pretty attractive, and this was a part of the building as a business model. And actually, at this stage, looks with alternative even for the -- not high but better elasticity than a combustible cigarette. Separately, not from the elasticity perspective, but from the pure affordability perspective, we were already pretty successful with IQOS in the so-called low middle income countries. But we also know that in order to make the more significant inroads. We need to come with the proposition, which directly addresses the need below-price, price segment. And we will not deliver the smokers behind alone. And before the end of this year, we having the plans to test another technology which would allow for the both devices and consumables to be more accessible from an affordability perspective, while there we're going to have reduction potential as I course as we know it today. So, we're taking those things into the very serious consideration. So thank you for your question. Well, this was a call longer than expected, but we also delivered the results last year better than we expected. I think somehow we match it. Thank you very much for your attention. We invite you to our CAGNY presentation, which will be in a position to give the more light, more details on the few aspects like what we discussed today, wellness healthcare, but also how we look here in a much broader in terms of the development of these categories. And I think we got filling in our, my voice and Emmanuel's voice how excited we are that '21, we delivered in that shape and form. And despite the number of headwinds, which I believe we articulate pretty well. We're still looking into the very successful and rewarding for both of us 2022. So thank you very much for your attention and hope to see most of you, if not all the recovered CAGNY presentation. Thank you, all."

            "name": "Emmanuel Babeau",
            "content": "Thank you, Jacek. Turning back to our 2021 results. Total shipment volumes increased by plus 4.2% in Q4 and by plus 2.2% for the year. This reflects continued strong broad-based growth from HTUs of plus 25% or 18.9 billion units for the full year, comfortably exceeding the decline of 3.6 billion cigarettes. The plus 2.4% increase in our Q4 cigarette volumes reflect the continued sequential recovery of the total industry and of our category share, in addition to a 2.7 billion stick favorable inventory movement, which mainly reflects inventory reduction in the prior year quarter. Due to the remarkable performance of IQOS, inter tobacco units comprised almost 14% of our total shipment volume in the fourth quarter and 13.2% for the year, as compared to 11% in full year 2020, 8% in 2019 and 5% in 2018. Our sales mix is evolving rapidly, putting us on track to become a majority smoke-free company by 2025. Smoke-free net revenues made up over 30% of our adjusted total revenue in Q4 and 29% for the year as compared to 24% in 2020. In 10 markets, we have already surpassed 50%. IQOS devices accounted for over 6% of the $9.1 billion of 2021 RP net revenues with a step up in H2, reflecting the IQOS ILUMA launch, outweighing the effect of supply constraint on the IQOS versions. We delivered plus 7.6% organic growth in 2021 net revenues on shipment volume growth of plus 2.2%, reflecting the twin engines driving our top line. The first is pricing on combustible and in certain markets on HTUs. Second is the increasing mix of HTUs in our business at higher net revenue per unit, which continues to deliver substantial growth and increasingly powerful driver as our transformation accelerates. Let's now turn to the driver of our 2021 margin expansion. Our gross margin increased by 190 basis points on an organic basis due to product mix, pricing and cost savings, while our adjusted marketing, administration and research costs were 10 basis points better as a percentage of adjusted net revenues. We generated over $800 million in gross cost savings in 2021 with around $550 million in manufacturing and supply chain productivity and more than $250 million in SG&A efficiency before inflation. This represents strong progress towards our target of around $2 billion for 2021, 2023 and allows us to reinvest in top line growth while continuing to deliver robust margin progression. While OI margin expansion was lower in H2, this reflects the positive dynamic of our business and the ability to return to normalized investment levels compared to the pandemic affected prior year. ILUMA device and HTU shipments commenced with higher initial unit cost and we reaccelerated investments in our commercial program, digital engine and R&D as well as a number of growth opportunities across categories and geographies. We intend to continue investing in such opportunities in 2022. But with the benefit of scale, operating leverage and accelerated efficiencies we continue to target organic SG&A increases below the rate of sales growth. Moving now to market share. Our share of the combustible category recovered and was essentially stable in Q4 on a year-over-year basis, as our portfolio initiatives bear fruit and pandemic-linked restrictions received in many markets. Our leadership in combustible helps to maximize switching to smoke-free products and we continue to target a stable category share over time despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization. Aside consumer growth, we accelerate, we target at first a slightly decline in 2022. For the combustible category overall, the improving total market backdrop includes notable Q4 recoveries in Indonesia, Mexico and Turkey, close to stable industry volume in the EU region and a modest recovery in duty free driven by sales outside Asia. Daily consumption remains below pre-coded level in certain markets such as the Philippines, where our share of market is influenced by mobility and social consumption. In Indonesia, our share was again broadly stable on a sequential basis despite the continued growth of the below Tier 1 segment and our volumes grew over 4% for the year. The reduction from 10 to 8 excise tax year in 2022 represents a step in the right direction, and the industry weighted average excise increase of around plus 13% is slightly below the prior year. However, the playing field remained unequaled between industry players and the pricing environment remains challenging. In terms of our overall share, ongoing gain for our IQOS portfolio create positive momentum going into this year, and we expect to resume overall share growth as well as achieving broadly stable total shipment volume. PMI HTUs now have a 7.1% share in the markets where they are present, making them the third largest tobacco brand. This includes the number one position in five markets, and the number two in a further six markets. Moving now to IQOS performance. We estimate there were approximately 21.2 million IQOS users as of December 31. The improved growth of plus 0.8 million in Q4 reflects our agile commercial model, which allowed us to rapidly adjust our consumer program and assortment. As demonstrated by the performance of ILUMA in Japan and Switzerland, the underlying momentum of the IQOS brand remains strong. While we don't yet have full visibility over the full year of 2022, as device shortages ease, we expect to gradually return to user growth at or above the prior run rate of around 1 million per quarter. We estimate that 72% of total users or 15.3 million adult smokers have switched to IQOS and stopped smoking with the balance in various stages of conversion. In the EU region, Fourth quarter HTU share reached 6.4% of total cigarette and HTU industry revenue, 1.4 points higher than Q4 last year. Underlying IMS growth trends remain excellent. This very good performance included strong growth across the region, with Italy reaching the milestone of 2 million users and positive contribution from Germany and Poland. I also want to highlight Hungary where our Q4 national HTU share exceeded 20%, following Japan and Lithuania enriching this important threshold. To give some further color on our progress in the EU region, this slide shows a selection of the latest key city of offtake shares. While Vilnius continued to lead the way with 37.5% share, the 20% level was also reached in Budapest, Rome and Athens. With strong progress across the region, we are especially pleased by Vienna, almost doubling to 4%, the strong traction in London at almost 6% share, and an acceleration in Zurich with the introduction of IQOS ILUMA. We show further HTU share data in the appendix to these slides. Share growth continued in Russia with our Q4 TU share up by plus 0.8 points to reach 8%. For both Russia and the overall region, sequential growth in adjusted IMS slowed in the last two quarters, partly reflecting the more acute device shortage and lead on commercial program. In addition, the region was affected by the halting of sales in Belarus, which impacted sequential IMF growth in Q4. In this context, as mentioned in last quarter, we have seen some increased discounted competitor offerings and disposable e-vapor products. We continue to see high interest in the category and with a pipeline of exciting innovations plan, including the launch of ILUMA, we aim to resume strong growth this year. In Japan now, the adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by plus-1.7 points to a record 21.8% in Q4. And an offtake exit share approaching 23%, with Q4 adjusted IMS sequential trends, incorporating the pull forward of consumer uptake into Q3 before the price increase. This performance reflects the strength of our portfolio and the launch of IQOS ILUMA, which I will come back to shortly. The overall heated tobacco category continues to grow, making up over 31% of the adjusted total Japanese tobacco market in Q4; with IQOS maintaining a high share of segment and capturing the majority of the category's 2021 growth. In addition to the strong progress in developed countries, we see very promising IQOS growth in low and middle income market. A prime example of this is Egypt where offtake share in Cairo is approaching 4% within six months of launch with other notable successes, including Lebanon, Jordan, the Dominican Republic and the Philippines despite funding in retraction in Manila. This low and middle-income market key city performance is especially encouraging as we achieved it despite the premium position of the current IQOS portfolio. We do intend to bring a new complementary range of heat-not-burn products tailored to emerging markets towards the end of this year, which I will come back to. With this potential in mind, we continue to drive the geographic expansion of our smoke-free products as we aim to be in 100 markets by 2025. During the quarter, we launched IQOS in both Morocco and Tunisia. This takes the total number of markets where PMI smoke-free products are available for sale to 71, of which 30 are in low and middle-income markets. We plan to add more market this year as we also meaningfully broaden our product offer and price segmentation within existing geography. This includes the expansion of feel and feet, which are now available in over 20 markets across multiple regions and our expansion of e-vapor and nicotine pouches. Following the implementation of the ITC's importation ban, IQOS is not currently available in the U.S. We continue to work on contingency plans, including domestic manufacturing and hope to be able to resume U.S. supply in the first half of 2023. It is important to remember that the ITC's decision on this patent is an outlier. We were encouraged by the U.S. patent office recent invalidation of one of the two patents included in the ITC ruling, and we expect a decision on the second patent by April 2, though this decision are subject to an appeal process. BAT has been universally unsuccessful in asserting the same two patent families against IQOS in Europe. Separately, in December, a German court ruled that BAT's GLO HYPER dual-coil heat-not-burn device infringes our patents and that we are entitled among other things to an injunction against BAT sales cells of the device. Moving now to IQOS ILUMA. We are delighted to report the outstanding success since its launch in Japan and Switzerland with sales performance and consumer reaction exceeding our expectation. In Japan, the uptake of ILUMA devices and consumables among both existing IQOS users and legal-adult smoker has been rapid with more than 20% of the large user base switching since the August launch and over 20% of sales to legal age smokers due to IQOS. Moreover, the enhanced and consistently high-quality user experience, better reliability and no need for cleaning has led to significant observed increases in conversion rate, retention rate and Net Promoter Score. This bodes well for volume growth and indeed, premium-priced TEREA consumables have been the fastest-growing launch in the small free category reaching an offtake share in the three main convenience store shares change of 8% within three months of national launch and driving the growth of the heat-not-burn category following the October tax-driven price increase. Early results in Switzerland have been even more remarkable with over one-third of sales to new user and TEREA making up over one-third of HD sales after only two months of commercialization. Our HTU share growth has accelerated accordingly from 6% in September to 7.9% in December. These results are very encouraging for the wider rollout of ILUMA in the EU region and around the world, and we plan to roll out gradually to more markets this year, mostly in H2. While we continue to manage device supply constraints, the unprecedented growth in Japan also means we have had to accelerate both the supply of TEREA consumable using airfreight and the conversion of our production line to support new market launches. With ILUMA, IQOS 3 DUO and LIL, we now have three heat-not-burn technologies under the IQOS umbrella to serve different consumer needs and segment the market. We have an exciting pipeline of innovation on devices and consumables across our technology at different price tiers. As I mentioned, we also plan to enhance our portfolio for future growth with the introduction of a new complementary technology towards the end of this year. This will be targeted at smokers in low and middle income market, catering to the consumer need of simple high-quality, affordable devices and consumable and specific local test performances. In terms of HTUs, after launching over 15 new ILUMA SKUs in Q4, we plan to continue expanding our portfolio across platforms, geography and price point this year. We continue to commercialize IQOS VEEV with very promising results in the first group of markets where we started in our own channel with a limited range of test variants and nicotine levels. IQOS VEEV is a premium product, providing a superior experience and the commercial faster of IQOS allows us to deploy efficiently and our scale through a bespoke route-to-market approach. As we start to expand distribution and the consumable offering, we observed signs of increased uptake and clear positive consumer feedback relative to competitive product. We see encouraging success in Italy and the Czech Republic, reaching double-digit offtake shares of close to 10 points with rapid progress also visible in Croatia within three months of launch. After launching in Canada and Ukraine in the fourth quarter, we plan to add more markets in 2022 with timing subject to device availability. We also continued preparation to apply for a PMTA from the U.S. FDA and now prudently assume readiness for filing in early 2023, given further clarity on the required preparatory steps. An additional exciting midterm growth opportunity is in the nicotine pouch category, where we aim to become a leading player with a Shiro brand. Nicotine pouches provide convenient smoke-free alternative for adult smokers. And while still early in many markets, we see Shiro playing an important role in our smoke-free portfolio over the coming years. Following the acquisition of AG Snus and Fertin Pharma, we have established a base of product development and manufacturing expertise. Although we are still learning about the promising category, our IQOS commercial infrastructure allows for a fast rollout and we plan a number of launches over the coming quarters. The first major activity is the full re-launch of the revitalized Shiro portfolio in the Nordic this month from its more limited prior presence with full commercial activity and a broad portfolio of flavors and strength variance. Separately, following feedback from the 2021 consumer test of our Platform 2 carbon product, the design of our current technology has been discontinued. We are assessing alternative design for this consumer segment. Turning now to our nascent business beyond nicotine, the 2021 acquisitions of Fertin, Vectura and OtiTopic provide the base for building critical respiratory and overall product development capabilities in tandem with our existing expertise. This opened up opportunity to deliver the positive effect of existing wellness and health care molecules in a fast and effective manner. For the time being, our reported number in the other segment showed the existing acquired business, which delivered $101 million in net revenue in the fourth quarter and a marginal operating loss of $1 million. The underlying performance is in line with our expectation with reported operating expenses reflecting the amortization of intangible, deal-related items and our planned investments. Around 39% of Q4 revenue were derived from Fertin's smoking cessation product and nicotine pouch operations. While we intend to continue the CDMO activities of the acquired companies, the most significant value to PMI is in this ability to develop and commercialize new products in the wellness and healthcare segment over time. We plan important R&D investment over the course of the coming years to support the aim of delivering meaningful incremental revenue starting two to three years from now as we pursue our ambition of at least $1 billion of net revenue from wellness and healthcare products by 2025. As I mentioned earlier, we expect an operating loss of around $150 million in 2022, with revenue of around $250 million, including smoking cessation products. We recognized investor interest in our future product line in these new areas and plan to provide more color at our CAGNY conference presentation on February 23. Moving to sustainability and our ESG priorities, I'm happy to share that we recently completed a new sustainability feasibility assessment to update and recalibrate our priorities in accordance with our biggest impact on society, double maturity and extensive stakeholder inputs. While addressing the health impact of our product remained by far the biggest focus, we also identified a number of topics, which are emerging in importance or required an evolved approach. We will publish the results next week. It is increasingly important to align management incentives with sustainability materiality, performance and impact. We will strengthen this link in 2022 with the new sustainability index and plan to provide more details in the near future. Our progress on sustainability continues to be recognized by leading external stakeholders with repeated inclusion in both the Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America and the Bloomberg Generic-Quality Index, and receiving CDP's AAA score for the second year running. We also published an agricultural labor practices report, making 10-year -- marking 10 years of the program. Since its introduction, we have successfully eradicated systemic issue related to child labor, while improving living condition of farmers and farm workers. It also outlined our ambition targets such as 100% farmers supplying tobacco to PMI, making the leasing income by 2025. On our most critical priority of product impact, the grown penetration of smoke-free products around the world is accelerating the end of cigarettes as legal age smokers reach to better alternative. I am also pleased to report further recent positive regulatory development. For example, as part of its beating cancer plan, the European Parliament special committee recognized and featured harm reduction in its last report for which the plenary vote will take place next week. In New Zealand, the government published its more action plan, expressly excluding small free product from the proposed measures. In addition, the number of countries, including Poland and Russia have announced new multiyear excise tax plan with taxation of smoke-free products clearly differentiated from cigarettes, making 15 markets globally with such plans. There is a growing body of scientific and real-world evidence of the substantial reduction potential of smoke-free product compared with smoking. While challenges in some markets are to be expected, we continue to support regulatory and fiscal framework that recognize this critical harm reduction opportunity. I will now turn back to Jacek for some concluding remarks. I'm going to take this. So, obviously, and we've been trying it in our preliminary remarks, we are still facing a number of uncertainties. The COVID does not disappear even if things seem to be improving. We don't have full visibility on the IT shortage and on the supply chain globally. And that is obviously what is behind with some certainly cautiousness on the guidance that we are giving on the top line. And then from there, we, of course, are driving a business that is seeing a good momentum. We have the traditional driver of price increase. We're going to be very efficient on cost savings. You can see what we've been delivering in 2021, already more than $800 million of efficiency on our cost. We're going to continue in 2022. And I know that is going to drive the difference between the revenue growth and the adjusted EPS organic growth. One of the headwinds that we're going to face this year, which I think we should see as very positive because it's coming from the growth, and we are managing a very nice potential of growth is that we are investing for exciting outlook. It starts, of course, with ILUMA in Japan, but globally, the launch of ILUMA, but certainly with a big impact in Japan, where we know that when we launch a new product, this is having some impact on the cost of goods because we are not at the same level in terms of efficiency on the supply chain. The productivity is not at its maximum, and we've been explaining that in our remarks. And that is going to have some impact at the launch. We talked about air freight as well and that is to have an impact. We said it with probably what we see today is a moderate decrease of the gross margin rate. Without that, it would have been from what we see today, another year of growth of the gross margin rate. But that's really what is driving the guidance. So we have some uncertainty, but we are very excited by the potential of growth that we see with all this innovation that is coming up. We have the traditional driver of efficiency that are going to help. We have some headwind, which was absolutely planned because we are coming with innovation, and we need to invest to launch this innovation. And I should add in terms of innovation, but it's certainly the fact that we are also expanding in terms of geography, what we see in Egypt bode extremely well for the potential in emerging countries, but we need to invest, of course, to build the capacity. We need to develop our commercial tools. We need to invest on the new platform, vaping and nicotine pouches. So what I think is great in this guidance and in our ambition for 2022 is that it's a year with a lot of investment for an exciting growth, but we are still able to deliver a good dynamic top line. We are able to deliver nice margin improvement, good organic growth at a good level. And as you have seen, we are hugely cash generative, and we do that at the same time, again, while investing for the future. Just to complement on your question on, can we reach 1 million. I think we are simply we see rather a ramp up today. It doesn't mean that we cannot reach 1 million in one of the quarter in H1, but it's true that we see a ramp-up and an acceleration as we go through the year. It's not a one-off. It could go a bit higher, but I don't expect an explosion here. I think you have a good calibration of the cutout that we're going to invest over a few years. Thank you all. See you soon."

Growth rates presented on organic basis reflect currency-neutral underlying results. Following the acquisitions of Fertin Pharma, Otitopic, and Vectura Group, PMI added the other category in the third quarter of 2021. Business operations for the other category are evaluated separately from the geographical operating segments.  Today's remarks contain Forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the Forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or Forward-looking statements. Please also note the additional Forward-looking and cautionary statements related to COVID-19. It's now my pleasure to introduce A - Emmanuel Babeau, our Chief Financial Officer. Emmanuel.\nEmmanuel Babeau : Thank you, Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. I hope everyone listening to the call is safe and well. Our business delivered another strong performance in the third quarter of 2021, coming ahead of our expectation to achieve a record [Indiscernible] quarterly adjusted diluted EPS of $1.58. Most notable was the continued excellent growth of IQOS driving +33% Q3 organic growth in RRP net revenue, and +7.6% for total PMI. HTU shipment volumes grew +24% compared to the same quarter last year to reach 23.5 billion units with broad-based growth for both our volume and the category across key geographies. This was delivered despite ongoing tightness in device supplies, due to the global semiconductor shortage, which impact IQOS user growth rates.  In combustibles, further sequential share gains supported total PMI giving growth of 2.1% in Q3. And we continue to expect total cigarette and it's [Indiscernible] goals for the year. We are firmly on track for a strong 2021 organic growth performance with an expected currency tailwind providing additional growth in the [Indiscernible]. We are also delighted to share outstanding initial result for IQOS ILUMA in Japan, and growing traction for IQOS VEEV in early launch markets. In the quarter, we made three milestone acquisition as we build our business for the long term to include product that go beyond tobacco and nicotine. Our smoke-free transformation is now also reflected in our financing with the launch of an industry for business transformation link financing framework. And we continue to prioritize return to shareholder through 4.2% increase in the dividend and ongoing share repurchases. Turning to the headline numbers, our Q3 net revenue grew by +7.6% on an organic basis or +9.1% in dollar terms.  This reflects the continued strength of IQOS and the recovery of the [Indiscernible] business in many markets. We witnessed good organic growth of plus 5.4% in our net revenue per unit, driven by the increasing weight of IQOS in our sales mix and pricing on both HTUs and combustibles. Our adjusted operating income margin decreased by 10 basis points on an organic basis.  This reflects the expected initial higher unit cost of IQOS ILUMA and increased commercial spend partly related to its launch, offsetting the continued positive effect from the increasing weight and profitability of IQOS, pricing, and productivity savings. Our resulting adjusted diluted EPS of $1.58 represent +8.5 organic growth, and +11.3 in the last terms, a very good performance. Looking now at year-to-date performance, our adjusted net revenues grew by almost +11% in dollar terms and by +7.3% organically. This reflect the consistent growth of IQOS where progress throughout the pandemic has been impressive. We delivered strong organic growth of nearly +6% in our net revenue per unit, again reflecting our shifting business mix and pricing with pricing on combustible at just over 3% or around 5%, excluding Indonesia.  Our year-to-date adjusted operating income margin increased by 280 basis points on an organic basis, an excellent performance driven by our top-line growth and [Indiscernible] of IQOS, and pricing combined with operating leverage and productivity savings. Our adjusted diluted EPS grew plus 15.8% organically and plus 20.4% in dollar term; also -- obviously a very strong results. This brings me to guidance for 2021.  We are revising our organic growth outlook for net revenues to plus 6.5% to plus 7%, representing the upper half of the previous range and reaffirming the strong outlook for organic OI margin expansion of around 200 basis points. We also confirm our currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth forecast at the upper end of our previous range, reflecting +13% to +14% growth, or +16% to +17% in dollar terms. This translating to an adjusted diluted EPS range of $6.01 to $6.06, including an estimated sub variable currency impact of $0.17 at prevailing rates. Following on from our most recent comment s, as the tightness in device supplies persist, we now expect our HTU shipment volume to be around 95 billion units as we prioritize devices for user retention. Given the continued growth of HTUs and the need to maintain inventory duration, we continue to expect our full-year shipments to be slightly ahead of IMS volume s. This guidance does not include any material impact of share repurchases or acquisition. Share repurchases through October the 15th amount to around $117 million after some limitation during Q3 from blackout restriction.  In term of other assumptions, we are assuming only a limited Q4 recovery in duty-free following a modest improvement in Q3 with intercontinental and Asian travels still very subdued. We continue to assume fully accomplishable pricing of +2 to +3%, with a softer expected Q4 reflecting continued pandemic-related challenges in certain markets, notably in South and Southeast Asia, as well as tough comparison in Germany and Australia. Lastly, in 2021, we continue to expect around $11 billion of operating cash flow at prevailing exchange rate subject to year-end working capital requirements.  We also update our expectation for full-year capital expenditures to around $0.6 billion reflecting latest launch plans and pandemic related planning factors. Before discussing depth, I am pleased to report some recent positive regulatory development further to the shares in previous quarters. For example, Switzerland adopted a new federal law on tobacco products and in cigarettes defining dedicated product category and differentiated as warnings. In New Zealand, the government has now published new regulation for smoke-free product, which allow branded packaging to be reintroduced with a specific text as warning.  In Egypt, earlier this year, smoke-free product were clearly differentiated from combustible cigarette in both Fiscal and regulatory treatment. There is a growing body of scientific and real-world evidence of the substantial risk reduction potential of non-combustible alternative compared with smoking. While fluctuations across different market are to be expected, we continue to support regulatory and Fiscal frameworks that recognize this critical [Indiscernible] reduction opportunity. Turning back now to our results, Q3 total shipment volume increased by plus 2.1% and by plus 1.5% year-to-date.  This reflect continued strong growth from HTU of +24% driven by the EU region, Japan, Russia, Ukraine, and encouraging progress from recently launched markets in the Middle East. HTU shipments were around 1 billion units below IMS volume for the third quarter, primarily reflecting timing around the August ILUMA launch and the October tax driven price increase in Japan. We expect this dynamic to reverse in Q4. The minus 0.4% decline in our Q3 cigarette volumes reflect the continued sequential recovery of total industry volume and of our market share.  Due to the impressive performance of IQOS, heated tobacco unit comprised 13% of our total shipment volume year-to-date as compared to 11% in full-year 2020, 8% in 2019, and 5% in 2018. Our sales mix is changing rapidly, putting us on track to achieve our aim of becoming a majority smoke-free Company by 2025. Smoke-free product made up almost 30% of our adjusted net revenue year-to-date compared to 23% for the same period in 2020, IQOS devices, accounted for over 6% of the $6.7 billion of RP net revenue. With a step-up in Q3, reflecting the IQOS into my launch, which outweighed the effects of supply constrain on other acquisitions. The plus 7.3% organic growth in year-to-date net revenues on shipment volume growth of plus 1.5% reflect the twin engines driving our top-line.  The first is pricing on combustible and, in certain markets, on HTUs. Second is the increasing mix of HTU s in our business at higher net revenue per unit, which continues to deliver substantial growth and increasingly powerful driver as our transformation accelerates. Let me now go into the driver of our year-to-date margin expansion starting with growth margin which expanded by 240 basis points on an organic basis.  While expansion was lower in Q3 as ILUMA devices were shipped to Japan for the launch, the multiple positive [Indiscernible] discussed in prior quarters continue. Our significant effort on manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies are also bearing fruits with around $450 million of gross productivity savings benefit. This was accompanied by robust SG&A efficiencies with our adjusted year-to-date marketing, administration, and research costs, 40 basis points lower as a percentage of adjusted net revenue on an organic basis. This reflects the ongoing digitalization and simplification of our business processes including our IQOS commercial engine and more efficient ways of working partly offset by increased commercial investment in Q3. With SG&A saving of more than $200 million before inflation and reinvestment, this mean we have generated over $650 million in overall growth efficiencies year-to-date.  This is strong progress toward the combined target of $2 billion for 2021, 2023. Moving to market share, sequential gains for both our IQOS and combustible portfolios give us strong momentum going into Q4 and next year, despite an approximate [Indiscernible] 3 points year-over-year drag in Q3 from market mix. Importantly, we expect further improvement in the fourth quarter for HTU s with record shares across key IQOS geographies.  For combustible, the improving total market volume backdrop includes notable recovery in Indonesia, Turkey, and Mexico, and close to stable Q3 industry volumes in the EU region. Our share of the combustible category has strongly recovered on a sequential basis, moving us one step closer to our target of stable share as our portfolio initiatives bear fruit and pandemic-linked restrictions recede in many markets. In South and Southeast Asia, renewed COVID -linked measures have somewhat dampened the recovery. Though industry volume have nonetheless improved sequentially in Indonesia and in the Philippines where the year-over-year trend is impacted by a challenging prior-year comparison. Our share in the region grew sequentially albeit less than expected, primarily given pandemic-related development in the Philippines. Let's now turn to the tightness in device supply due to the global semiconductor shortage. As we communicated in September, with demand continuing to grow, this has already affected the availability and assortment of IQOS devices in certain markets in Q3, which impact our ability to run at full commercial and competitive capacity and fulfill consumer demand.  Device shipment outside Japan were limited to a 7% year-over-year increase, significantly below the growth in net sales. This resulted in slower user growth of several 100,000 in the quarter notably in Russia, given limitation on the IQOS to the 4 plus device as flagged in recent communication. At this stage, semiconductor supply forecasting remains volatile so we assume the tight supply situation will persist into the first half of 2022. We will continue to carefully prioritize necessary device replacement for existing users, followed by device sales targeted at acquisition.  The successful start of IQOS ILUMA in Japan confirmed it would be a significant driver of acquisition and retention. Nonetheless, at the beginning it triggers significant upgrades from existing large IQOS user base, many of whom don't really needed to replace their devices. This is a highly desired consumer behavior in normal supply [Indiscernible], but increases constraint in the shortage. Therefore, we now assume that additional major launches would only take place in the second half of next year. Given this evolving situation, we have continued important commercial investment in key area.  This include portfolio expansion and product launches such as IQOS ILUMA in Japan and IQOS VEEV, smoke-free category, understanding and awareness campaign, and a number of commercial development project. Including the investment already made in Q3, we anticipate around $300 million of incremental H2 spending compared to the first half. Overall, this is a temporary phenomenon and with demand remaining strong, we expect user growth to reaccelerate once shortages ease. We have a pipeline of exciting innovation on devices and consumable, including but not exclusive to ILUMA, and a number of new market entries plan. However, there are short-term shortage scenario under which the transitory supply impact on user growth could result in 2022 organic growth below our 2021, 2023 targeted average rate for net revenues, OI margin expansion, and adjusted diluted EPS. Nonetheless, with a strong 2021 as a base and a robust reacceleration port shortage, we confirm our confidence in our 2021-2023 growth targets. Moving now to IQOS performance, we estimate there were 20.4 million IQOS users as of September the 30th. Excluding the impact of international sanction in Belarus, this reflect growth of around 0.4 million user s in the quarter with the rate of growth subdued by the tightness of device supply and the time needed to adjust our commercial programs. As demonstrated again by the ILUMA launch in Japan, the underlying momentum of the IQOS brand remains strong.  Following adjustment of our program and assortment, we expect Q4 user growth to improve by a few 100,000 compared to the growth seen in Q3. The reduce user growth for the second half should therefore be broadly consistent with the potential 2 to 3 billion HTU impact flagged in recent communications. We estimate that 73% of total user or 14.9 million adult smokers have switched to IQOS and stopped smoking with the balance in various stages of conversion. The user growth again reflect acquisition across key IQOS geography, despite device constraint. In the EU region, third quarter share for each reached 5.3% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume plus 1.4 points higher than Q3 last year. As mentioned last quarter, we expect a sequential share for HTU s to be broadly stable due to the effect of seasonality and pandemic-related fluctuation on the combustible market. Underlying IMS growth trends remain excellent. And as in the prior year, we expect a strong Q4 in both volume and market share terms. This very good performance includes strong growth across the region with Italy, Germany, and Poland as notable contributors. Robust performance continued in Russia with our Q3 HTU share by plus 1.1 point, to which 6.9%, while lower than Q2, notably due to the seasonality of the combustible market, we expect further sequential growth in IMS to deliver strong quarterly share increase in Q4 as in the prior year. We had the largest limitation on lower-priced devices and related commercial programs in Russia.  And we have seen some increased consumer trial of discounted competitor offering a disposable e-vapor product. However, we continue to see high interest in the category and with both our existing price tier portfolio and future innovation supporting our clear category leadership, we see ample room for further strong growth over time.  There is also [Indiscernible] H2 growth across the eastern Europe region with Ukraine, Kazakstan, and southeast Europe contributing. This slide shows the positive overall regional growth trend in adjusted IMS albeit somewhat dampened on a sequential basis by the halting of shipments to Belarus due to International sanction and timing factor in Kazakhstan. In Japan, the adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by plus 2 points versus the prior-year quarter due to 20.8%, and adjusted IMS grew sequentially to reach a record high of 8.2 billion units, reflecting the strength of our portfolio and the launch of IQOS ILUMA. Adjusted sequential share fell by 0.2 point sequentially, reflecting volatility in the total market ahead of the October the 1st excise increase in addition to normal seasonality. While consumer pantry loading effect may wait on Q4 IMS, we expect further robust underlying growth in volume and a nice sequential improvement in market share. The overall heated tobacco category continues to grow, making up almost 30% of the adjusted total Japanese tobacco market in Q3 with IQOS maintaining a high share of segment and capturing the majority of the category's growth.  In addition to strong growth in existing markets, we continue to drive the geographic expansion of our smoke-free product as we aim to be in one other market by 2025. During the quarter, we launched IQOS in Egypt, the first in Africa, and reached an off-take exit share of 2% in Europe and Cairo. We also now add Norway and Iceland, where our recent acquisition of [Indiscernible] gives us a presence in the [Indiscernible] and nicotine pouch category. This take the [Indiscernible] snooze total number of markets where PMI smoke-free product are available for sale to 70 of which 28 are in low and middle-income market, which we are introducing as more robust measure of making smoke-free product available to adult smoker in emerging countries.  Again, we may have some delays in this market expansion program in the first half of 2022. Given our smoke-free leadership and global reach, let me pause and share a few words regarding the strength of our intellectual property. Across all our smoke-free product, we have strong patent and as being the clear leading innovator in the tobacco category over recent years, investing billions of dollars in the process.  Despite attempts to disrupt our business through litigation by your competitor who lags behind on R&D and innovation. We have been -- you need us to be successful in defending our product against IP challenges in all 11 ruling outside of the U.S. Including the UK high court and at the European Patent Office. The U.S.A. -- the U.S. ITC is a federal agency which, among other things, deals with import, trained to ensure domestic industry of U.S. intellectual property rights. We also note the two paths I mentioned in the ITC final determination were both drafted after IQOS had been launched. The FDA, fulfilling the exclusive [Indiscernible] interest mandate given to it by Congress for tobacco product, has already found that IQOS is appropriate for the promotion of public health and expected to benefit the health of the population as a whole. We are hopeful in the current presidential review period that the U.S. Trade Representative will consider the impact on current American IQOS users and the many more that would be denied access. In the scenario where the ITC determination is upheld, where the financial impact of this time is in material, given the early stage of the U.S. IQOS fallout, this would unfortunately meaning that U.S. consumers would be unable to buy IQOS for a bit of time. Meanwhile, our contingency plans are underway and include domestic manufacturing.  The U.S. patent office is also reviewing certain claim of the patents in question with initial ruling expected in 2022, and by subject to an appeal process. While the ITC ruling may cause near-term disruption to the U.S. availability of IQOS, we continue to see a large opportunity for IQOS in the United States over the coming years. The global IQOS innovation story took a historic step forward in August with the launch of two ILUMA devices and a range of [Indiscernible] HTUs in Japan. Building on the success of IQOS 3 Dual, we believe the simple and intuitive device will support easier switching and higher conversion for [Indiscernible] edge smoker using SmartCore internal induction heating technology.  While -- with the national roll -out taking place at the start of September, initial results were outstanding with device sales well ahead of all comparable past launches at the same stage despite some limitation on device availability and the proportion of new users growing to 18%. [Indiscernible] purchases are growing rapidly, exiting the quarter at over 10% of total PMI HTU of tech volume. Consumer feedback has also been very positive, with meetings increases in the net [Indiscernible].  Following the success, we plan to launch in our second market of Switzerland next month and look forward to additional major launches in 2022 when circumstances allow. We continue to commercialize IQOS VEEV with good progress in the first group of markets, where we started in our own channels with a limited range of taste variants and nicotine levels. IQOS VEEV is a premium product, providing a superior experience. And the commercial infrastructure of IQOS allows it to deploy efficiently and at scale through a bespoke route-to-market approach. As we start to expand distribution and the consumable offering, we see sign of increased uptake and clear positive consumer feedback related to competitive products. We see encouraging early success in Italy where VEEV reached an estimated 7% national exit volume of tech share of crude system product -- system put, sorry, despite not yet being available nationally.  And in the Czech Republic with an estimated 8% national volume of tech exit share. We also launched in Croatia in Q3, Canada in October, and plan to launch in Ukraine before year-end. We also continue preparations to apply for a PMTA from the U.S. FDA in the second half of 2022. Turning now to our strategy to moving to new business areas beyond tobacco and nicotine, which focuses on leveraging and complementing our existing capabilities in the health care and wellness space. We see significant opportunity in adjacent area with our two focused corridors of self-care wellness, including botanicals and inhaled therapeutics, expected to have an addressable market of around $65 billion by 2025.  The acquisitions of Fertin Pharma, Otitopic, and Vectura enabled us to more rapidly expand our development capabilities with over 250 scientists, infrastructure, technology, and expertise in innovative enameled and oral product formulation while continuing to grow CDMO activities. As shown on this slide, this opens up a number of highly complementary opportunities and new focus areas. This acquisition will fully leverage PMI 's existing capability like science, product innovation, and clinical expertise related to innovation. We look forward to updating you more in the future on our plans and progress in these exciting new areas. Moving to sustainability and our ESG priorities, we continue to make good progress throughout our [Indiscernible] through advancing our transformation and addressing our most material impact on society.  We broaden access to our smoke-free product by increasing the availability to adult smoker around the world with new product launches across the growing range of market and smoke-free categories. In addition, our recent acquisition build our human intellectual and social capital, adding smoke-free capabilities and laying the foundation for a strong business in areas beyond tobacco and nicotine, as we strive to develop commercially successful product that seek to have a net positive impact on society. I am proud to highlight the recent publication of our business transformation linked financing framework. And subsequent refinancing of our revolving credit facility. The framework which follows ICMA principal and receive a second party opinion from S&P, links our financing to [Indiscernible] targets in our transformation. Last, we remain on track to achieve carbon neutrality of our direct operation by 2025, five-years ahead of our 2030 target. In addition, with the United Nations Climate Change Conference approaching, we plan to publish a robust, low carbon transition plan and white paper on climate justice, which highlight the connectivity between environmental and social issues. Overall, we are on track for excellent top and bottom-line growth performance in 2021 with strong underlying momentum for IQOS and robust cash generation. We are investing in the broadening of our smoke-free product portfolio and geographic reach. This is critical as we seek to accelerate the number of adult smokers who switched to better alternative with the growing positive impact on society. In addition, we are investing in the capabilities of tomorrow as illustrated by our three recently announced acquisitions, which provide a comprehensive development platform in safe care wellness and in health therapeutic, and strengthen our position in modern oral nicotine.  We have increased cash return to shareholders in Q3 through higher dividend and our share repurchase program in line with our objective to deliver sustainable value and return to investors as we continue our journey towards becoming a majority smoke-free Company. For 2022, we have a pipeline of exciting innovation for both devices and consumable. And we expect IQOS user growth to reaccelerate when device shortages ease. We continue to see a strong future for our business and remain confident in our 2021-2023 organic growth targets. Thank you very much, and I'm now happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference. [Operator Instructions] In the interest of fairness and time, we ask that participants please keep a maximum of two questions each. If time allows, follow-up questions may be taken. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Gaurav Jain with Barclays.\nGaurav Jain : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions.\nEmmanuel Babeau :  [Indiscernible]\nGaurav Jain : [Indiscernible]. My first question is on the -- unit 2022 comments around growth rate being lower than the range you have given for 2021-2023 because of the issues around device supply. Now, if device supply is lower and your IQOS acquisition is lower, then doesn't it imply that your commercial investments are also lower and so it should be beneficial to your EPS, or is that a correct way -- incorrect way of thinking about things?\nEmmanuel Babeau : So thank you, Guarav, for the question. First of all, let me repeat that this is one scenario, the fact that the constraints are going to stay with us in H1 next year. This is not the only one, so you have more favorable scenario. And at that stage, frankly, it's a fast-moving, super-fluid situation. So we don't know, but I think it was really important to share the possibility that the pressure on availability that we are seeing in H2 2021, we're still going to see it in in H1 2022.  So that's the scenario you are referring to and in this situation we would see after this six months second half of 2021, we'd see another six months period with reduced acquisition that is the underlying potential that we have seen in H1. In this situation, no doubt that, of course, the spending would be impacted by the fact that the number of launches or a number of commercial activities, that's happening, that's very clear. But at the same time, I think we've been very clearly saying it today, we are absolutely sure of the very strong potential of IQOS. And we think that this potential remained absolutely unchanged by what's going on. So there will be when the shortage ease, a very nice acceleration.  On top of that, we will be coming at the same time with very exciting innovation. You know ILUMA, there is more in the pipe. So we're going to make sure even when there is some limitation on availability that we keep building awareness, we keep building the category, but also the IQOS franchise. So not all cost will go away because we're going to -- I mean, we are here to make a success. As you know, on the long time and not managing only 6 months. So yes, there would be in this scenario -- once again it's one scenario, among others. They would be reduction in investment. But as you can see in Q3, we continue to invest even when there is some limitation because we are building this long-term success that is extremely clear in the outlook that we have.\nGaurav Jain : Thank you. And a follow-up question on your U.S. strategy. And there are number of almost like cross-currents going on that you're partnering with Altria for IQOS and they're now you have lost the lawsuit versus VAT. And there is a potential that you have to do domestic production of your devices. Then you are also planning to file a PMTA for IQOS VEEV later next year, so that could also be a potential new product than the U.S. market. And then you've also acquired Fertin, which also gives you to capability to potentially launch a modern oral product in the U.S. if you file for that PMTA as well. So how should we think about, in some parts you will be partnering with Altria, in some other parts you could potentially be competing with Altria. So how does it all fit together?\nEmmanuel Babeau : Thank you, Guarav, for the question. Let me clarify it again. We have commercial partnership with Altria and each of them tobacco products, so that's very clear. And we're going to see what is the final outcome of this ITC question. I will not rest with the final conclusion. We are at the time of the presidential review. We frankly think it's going to be a defining moment for the objective of the FDA of tobacco on reduction. I think the administration has a great opportunity here to flag how important this tobacco harm reduction policy is. And that would mean to protect IQOS, which is the only [Indiscernible] inhaled nicotine product that is today benefiting from [Indiscernible] in the U.S. So we are still hopeful that we're going to get a positive conclusion after the presidential ruling for us. In the case that it was not the final outcome, of course, we'll continue to work with Altria. The development would be a bit delayed. We'll find a solution to overcome the ITC decision. And we've been flagging the fact that it could go for local production. And, as I think I've been saying during my notes, we remain absolutely convinced of the very strong potential of IQOS in the U.S. So that's one thing. And then you have the other Altria category where indeed we have ambition and you've said it, we are going to file for a PMTA for VEEV.  We could be considering launching modern oral product at a certain point in time as well. And on this one, all the options are open, so we don't have any commercial agreement today. And we will decide in due course how we want to launch and with which kind of set up or partnership. But no decision has been made at that stage.\nGaurav Jain : Thanks a lot, Emmanuel.\nEmmanuel Babeau : Thank you, Guarav.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Bonnie Herzog with, I apologize, Goldman Sachs. Your line is now active.\nBonnie Herzog : Thank you. Hi, Emmanuel.\nEmmanuel Babeau : Hello, Bonnie.\nBonnie Herzog : I had a couple of questions on IQOS ' performance during the quarter. First, is there any sense of how much stronger device sales could have been in the quarter without the supply constraints? In other words, curious to hear from you how strong orders might be for new invites -- devices, especially on ILUMA. And then maybe if you could share how big of a backlog there is. And then surrounding this issue, I just was curious to better understand what gives you the conviction that these issues are going to subside by the second half and just thinking about the risks. These shortages last longer. And then finally on his topic, are there any consent -- contingencies you guys might be working on, or any way for you to be less dependent on the semiconductor suppliers going forward?\nEmmanuel Babeau : Thank you Bonnie. So first question on the IQOS potential in term of sale of device during Q3 without the constraint. We are seeing that we've been missing several 100,000 of sale of devices. So it's obviously very, very material and we've been reporting the fact that outside Japan and really we have to look outside Japan because Japan with the launch of ILUMA was a specific situation. So outside Japan, devices have been growing by 7%, which is, of course, very, very significantly below the underlying growth of our markets.  And we are growing still close to 25% even in Q3. So that I think give an idea of the kind of GAAP that we may have been facing during this quarter. We believe, as I said, that during Q4, as we now have a better, I would say, grip on things, we've been managing on the reassortment, reallotment. We have a better understanding of the kind of commercial actions that are giving the best possible return. We have a very clear view on how we're going to prioritize. So we believe that we are growing even still with the severe restriction on devices, I'm not able to say whether that would be exactly the same level, but let's take that as an assumption, the same level as Q3, we believe that in terms of user growth, we could do better than in Q3. And we mentioned a few 100 thousand better user growth acquisition. So altogether, that mean that if you believe that the [Indiscernible] underlying growth rate was between 4.5 to 5 million user a year that we're seeing in each one, we're going to miss anywhere between 1 to 1.5 million user growth in H2 altogether.  And that is absolutely consistent. So that was something that was already here in September -- at the beginning of September, that is consistent with the 2 to 3 billion impact that we mentioned at the beginning of September. But I hope it helps you have some understanding -- better understanding of the impact of the device shortage. And how you should -- you should see it. On -- we are working, I can tell you, around the clock to manage the shortage. We are using all possible lever. So of course we are in very intense discussion with our suppliers exploring old possibility.  We are dominantly optimizing the planning and of course it's quite complex because we talk about shortages on various type of IC, and they are not all entering into the same kind of reference of our range. So we're managing that as well. We are looking at the split by market as well, and we've been buying a little bit and maybe we could be able to have even more success there. So we are really putting all the lever we can to minimize the impact. And today what we are hearing is that the number of capacity should kick in in the first half of next year. And I would tend to think there is a kind of consensus on the fact that H2 next year should be much better in terms of constraint, if not fully back to normal. So this is an assumption that we have today. But I have to admit that we've seen the situation moving fast, rapidly. And as I said, maybe things are going to improve faster because something is going to happen in the overall demand of the economy in the next six months. So maybe that could be even an improvement in H1. That's a scenario. Does it mean that another scenario that H2 could be with more question mark? Well, maybe. What we are hearing when we talk with our partner and supplier so far. But I have to admit that nothing is totally clear on that stage.\nBonnie Herzog : Okay. Super helpful. If I may, I'd like to maybe squeeze in another quick question. Just during this period of slower IQOS device sales and new user acquisition, how should we think about your total volume growth? So is it safe to assume your combustible cig volume will be elevated during this period of slower IQOS device sales and essentially be strong enough to more than offset this? And then given this dynamic, how should we think about this mix impact on your margins in the next few quarters? Thanks.\nEmmanuel Babeau : Sorry, your line was not very good, but you were asking how we should expect the impact on user acquisition versus volumes, correct?\nBonnie Herzog : Sorry, if it didn't come through -- more so on the mix, Emmanuel, because I'm thinking during this period of slower IQOS device sales, combustible cig volume could be elevated.\nEmmanuel Babeau : Yeah.\nBonnie Herzog : [Indiscernible] thinking that mix dynamic can impact on margins.\nEmmanuel Babeau : Look, we continue to target very nice growth of IQOS and [Indiscernible] is a brilliant category altogether. And of course, as the EPS leader of this category, we see that continuing in the coming quarters. And as you know as well, that is coming with a very nice mix in terms of revenue per stick, and it's still very much visible in our Q3 numbers. And we also flagged the fact that that was positive in terms of gross margin rate for the consumable business, the IQOS business. So maybe if the growth is a bit weaker because of the situation, the positive mix will continue to evolve; has already, but at a lower pace. But that's going to continue to be nicely positive. And on top of that, of course, then there is a question of, okay, what are we going to spend in terms of SG&A in this kind of situation. So it's difficult to say that it's going to be necessarily as in a negative impact on the margin. We are talking about very powerful driver on our financial performance. And even once again, is the growth rate is going to decrease a bit, still going to be significantly higher than any evolution on [Indiscernible]. And it's going to still continue to deliver a positive impact on the mix.\nBonnie Herzog : All right. Thank you so much again.\nEmmanuel Babeau : Thank you, Bonnie.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nPamela Kaufman : Hi, good morning. I have a follow-up question --\nEmmanuel Babeau : Good morning.\nPamela Kaufman : Good morning. I have a follow-up question about the outlook for next year and the scenarios that will drive the risks to be below your midterm target. It sounds like you're anticipating weaker 1H supply and an improvement in the second half. Would this scenario drive your results to fall below the side and 9% revenue and earnings growth target, or would supply conditions need to worsen relative to these assumptions?\nEmmanuel Babeau : Of course, we can play without limits with that very scenario. We have to admit that we've been seeing already in Q3 a weakening of user growth. And as we said, versus -- even if we expect in Q4 an improvement versus Q3, it will still be below the underlying trend. And then, you know, in the scenario that we are describing, we say if the shortages continue in H1 next year, that's when we're going to face this pressure on growth. So it's difficult for me to just comment one scenario. But [Indiscernible], that's the accumulation of what has been happening in H2 this year, 2021, and what could happen the beginning of next year, so H1 2022, that could drive a reduction in the potential growth rate next year. Which would be temporary once again, and when there is a rebound, the [Indiscernible] will come, but that would be the combination that would trigger something that could be below our average growth targets.\nPamela Kaufman : Thank you. That was helpful. My next question is on the ITC decision. Can you elaborate on your contingency plans for making IQOS available in the U.S. What would be the timing of manufacturing IQOS in the U.S. And just to clarify, does the ruling also pertain to ILUMA technology? In terms of bringing ILUMA to the U.S. market, is there an opportunity to bridge IQOS 's PMTA application for ILUMA to accelerate its entry into the U.S.?\nEmmanuel Babeau : So regarding the ITC contingency plan, if eventually the presidential review was not favorable, but I want to repeat before answering you that we are hopeful that this presidential review will have a positive outcome for us for the reason I mentioned previously. I cannot elaborate further, unfortunately, but that clearly -- it's part of what we described, the fact that we could have some local production as an element, but I won't elaborate further on how this could happen and how we would get there. On the ILUMA PMTA, a PMTA, frankly, we will need to have a discussion with the FDA on the process and all the process would be carried by the FDA. And at this stage, I'm not able to answer you. So we will certainly require -- ask for a PMTA on ILUMA at a certain point in time, but not in a position today to comment on timing.\nPamela Kaufman : Okay. Understood. Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau : Thank you Pam.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Vivien Azer with Cowen. Your line is now open.\nVivien Azer : Hi, thank you. Good morning.\nEmmanuel Babeau : Good morning, Vivien.\nVivien Azer : I apologize for belaboring the ITC issue, but I've got a question on that too. You've noted your track record of success in terms of defending against litigation internationally. Two questions, please. Number 1, are there current cases that are still pending internationally around IP litigation? If so, can you outline where those exist. And number 2, can you just clarify that the litigation that you've successfully defended addresses the exact same claims that were reviewed by the ITC? Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau : Well, there are a number of cases pending, I won't elaborate on that. Not all of them are public. And notably in Europe, I just want to repeat that so far in Europe, we've been on 11 cases, trial or at appeal, we've been successful. So I think it tells a lot about the strength of what we've been doing. And yes, some of the patents on which the ITC based their decision before proceeding for review but then that have been reviewed by a number of courts in Europe. And it to be the UK court. And they already have the [Indiscernible] and the UK court precisely has invalidated two family of patent that are at the original ITC decision. And the European Patent Office already evaluated one of this family of patent, so even fundamentally on the merit of the patent and the validity of the patent, we have been going through success in Europe.\nVivien Azer : That's helpful. Thank you. And then my follow-up question is on combustible cigarettes. The outlook is getting modestly, it's better; pricing, you've reiterated. If I recall correctly, as we kind of started the year, I think there was a point of caution around pricing with COVID uncertainty, etc, etc. What is your view of the consumer? I know it's a broad question; you operate in a lot of markets. But if you were a little bit conservative or cautious on pricing, when we started the year, what is your feeling about your ability to take pricing today? Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau : Well, you have to still give me the remaining weeks for the year before I can elaborate on next year. I think it's still quite unclear what's going to be the environment. One might think that inflation clearly accelerating in many countries, we'll maybe build a global environment that could be better than what we thought initially, but that's still early time. So I'm not able to comment at that stage, so I will keep a cautious stance, which was built, you probably remember on the aftermath of the COVID and the impact of many economy are being under shock.  So we were seeing that that was probably not making a great landscape for price increase. But I have to admit that I don't know what's going to be the impact coming from what seems to be a general increase in inflation. And maybe that is going to create a more favorable situation, but bear with us, it's still a couple of months before we can have a clearer view on that one.\nVivien Azer : Understood. Thank you very much.\nEmmanuel Babeau : Thanks, Vivien.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Chris Growe with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nChris Growe : Thank you. Good morning.\nEmmanuel Babeau : Hi Chris.\nChris Growe : I had a question. Hi, Emmanuel. Thank you. I just had a quick follow-up on the supply shortage. Sorry to keep going there, but I did hear some effect on the 2.4 device. I know it's limiting ILUMA's launch in some markets. Is this chip shortage true for all your products, those 3.0 and duo. Just to be sure, are those also affected by the chip shortage?\nEmmanuel Babeau : Well, Chris, that would mean that we will need to enter into great detail of how we are prioritizing our portfolio, and I don't think I want to do that because, of course, that's quite strategic for us. What is very clear is that we have one, North Star, if you want, which is to first protect our existing IQOS user and to make sure that we make device available when they want to renew the device. And second, of course, we want to optimize any commercial action to make sure that we have the highest return on a new device that we are selling and that we avoid as much as possible selling device with a very low percentage of utilization afterwards by the consumer.  And certainly for us, moving and taking the benefit of that to step up the blade technology and move IQOS 3 as a priority instead of IQOS 2.4+ was one of the moves that we have decided to make. And that explain why we have some more limitation on top of the fact that due to component issue there was also more pressure on 2.4, but obviously in these kind of moment s where a lot of things are on the table, you are managing constraint and long-term strategic vision as well. That's what we're doing.\nChris Growe : Thank you for that color there. And just a separate question in relation to some of your beyond nicotine and tobacco acquisitions, Otitopic and Vectura, in particular respiratory drug companies. I just had a simple kind of high-level question. Do you need more pieces to fit that vision you have for respiratory drugs? And just to understand kind of what stage we're at in terms of your acquisitions, to understand if you need to do more here in the short-term, if this is a good base to which you can build this element of your beyond nicotine sales.\nEmmanuel Babeau : So globally, we think that we have put on beyond nicotine great platforms if you want, and notably in term of R&D. And I think there is a lot we're going to be able to do already with this acquisition. Now, does it mean that in the future, we could think of other [Indiscernible] acquisition that would bring additional capacity that we don't have here maybe, but I think for the time being, we're going to focus on making sure that we integrate this acquisition and we maximize the synergy. In the interview as I said, in terms of R&D, which were really two big objectives to combine strengths on R&D. And we optimize by putting -- know our all skills, talent together, we optimize what we can do already in therapeutic, but I could make the comment as well for 13 and self - care wellness.\nChris Growe : And just to be clear, these acquisitions should not take you away from your separate goal of repurchasing you shares? That's kind of the main thing I was looking at just to understand future capital commitments through your [Indiscernible].\nEmmanuel Babeau : Nothing. No, absolutely. Nothing has changed on our buyback program. Absolutely.\nChris Growe : That's great. Thank you so much. Have a good day.\nEmmanuel Babeau : Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our final question from Callum Elliott with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nCallum Elliott: Thanks for the question. I was just [Indiscernible] Emmanuel, could you talk please about the tax situation for IQOS in Germany, recognizing that the political landscape is still shrouded in some uncertainty. It does seem like the proposed tax changes would be a material headwind to price mix and profitability next year, so just hoping that you could frame the magnitude of this impact. And then maybe sort of slightly bigger picture, do you see an increased risk of contagion for this kind of big IQOS tax increase in other markets?\nEmmanuel Babeau : Well, on Germany what I can certainly you repeat is the fact that it's a mixed feelings about the German decision because on one side, we are very happy with such a prominent country as Germany, putting in allows the fact that this project are better and should be treated differently than cigarette, and I think it's really great that this tobacco harm reduction principle is recognized. At the same time, 20% differentials seem too low. Yes of course it will have impact as we are progressively impacted by it.  And it's too early for me to give an idea of what's going to be the impact next year. But there will be some impact of course, [Indiscernible] it's not going to derail our fundamentally the trajectory on IQOS and profit growth. But we believe that 20% is not enough. So we are hopeful that at a certain point in time and it's too early to say, of course, the new coalition is yet form, even if things are getting clarified.  But we know whether there is the possibility that starting from these 20% differential. There is a plan to grow it over time, and that could be a possibility. Now, in term of contagion, we don't see that today. We see, on the contrary, when we look at the latest country, they are now coming to a differentiated treatment when it comes to each of them versus CC, we see normally most of the cases significantly higher even, differential versus Germany. So more than 20%. If I take just one example, that's the case in Egypt for instance. So in the recent decision taken by authorities, they are clearly making a bigger difference, which I think to a large extent is much more in line with the reduction in exposure to toxicans. You have a 90 to 95% if you wanted to have a rule to determine what could be the difference. Well, maybe that should be the guideline. And I think we are happy to see a number of country, regulatory government moving to the differentiated treatment between CC and [Indiscernible] and taking a big difference on tax treatment.\nChris Growe : Okay. Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau : Thank you.\nOperator: We have no further questions at this time. I will turn the program back over to Nick Rolli for any additional or closing remarks.\nNicholas Rolli : Actually, I think Emmanuel has a few brief remarks.\nEmmanuel Babeau : Yes. Thank you, Nick. Just give me a moment to wrap up with some brief closing comments. First of all, 2021 is on track to be a great year for the growth of IQOS and the financial performance of our business. We see continuation of strong underlying fundamentals, demand, and momentum for the IQOS brand. And last, but certainly not least, despite near-term challenges with device supply, we remain on track for our 3-year growth targets supported by a rich innovation pipeline. So thank you very much for your time today and we look forward to talking to you soon.\nNicholas Rolli : Thank you very much, Emmanuel. That concludes the call. If you have any follow-up questions, you may contact the Investor Relations team. Thank you again. Have a nice day.\nEmmanuel Babeau : Thank you. Talk to you soon. Bye-bye.\nOperator: This does conclude the Philip Morris International Q3, 2021 earnings call. You may disconnect at any time.",

            "name": "Emmanuel Babeau",
            "content": "Thank you, Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. I hope everyone listening to the call is safe and well. Our business delivered another strong performance in the third quarter of 2021, coming ahead of our expectation to achieve a record [Indiscernible] quarterly adjusted diluted EPS of $1.58. Most notable was the continued excellent growth of IQOS driving +33% Q3 organic growth in RRP net revenue, and +7.6% for total PMI. HTU shipment volumes grew +24% compared to the same quarter last year to reach 23.5 billion units with broad-based growth for both our volume and the category across key geographies. This was delivered despite ongoing tightness in device supplies, due to the global semiconductor shortage, which impact IQOS user growth rates.  In combustibles, further sequential share gains supported total PMI giving growth of 2.1% in Q3. And we continue to expect total cigarette and it's [Indiscernible] goals for the year. We are firmly on track for a strong 2021 organic growth performance with an expected currency tailwind providing additional growth in the [Indiscernible]. We are also delighted to share outstanding initial result for IQOS ILUMA in Japan, and growing traction for IQOS VEEV in early launch markets. In the quarter, we made three milestone acquisition as we build our business for the long term to include product that go beyond tobacco and nicotine. Our smoke-free transformation is now also reflected in our financing with the launch of an industry for business transformation link financing framework. And we continue to prioritize return to shareholder through 4.2% increase in the dividend and ongoing share repurchases. Turning to the headline numbers, our Q3 net revenue grew by +7.6% on an organic basis or +9.1% in dollar terms.  This reflects the continued strength of IQOS and the recovery of the [Indiscernible] business in many markets. We witnessed good organic growth of plus 5.4% in our net revenue per unit, driven by the increasing weight of IQOS in our sales mix and pricing on both HTUs and combustibles. Our adjusted operating income margin decreased by 10 basis points on an organic basis.  This reflects the expected initial higher unit cost of IQOS ILUMA and increased commercial spend partly related to its launch, offsetting the continued positive effect from the increasing weight and profitability of IQOS, pricing, and productivity savings. Our resulting adjusted diluted EPS of $1.58 represent +8.5 organic growth, and +11.3 in the last terms, a very good performance. Looking now at year-to-date performance, our adjusted net revenues grew by almost +11% in dollar terms and by +7.3% organically. This reflect the consistent growth of IQOS where progress throughout the pandemic has been impressive. We delivered strong organic growth of nearly +6% in our net revenue per unit, again reflecting our shifting business mix and pricing with pricing on combustible at just over 3% or around 5%, excluding Indonesia.  Our year-to-date adjusted operating income margin increased by 280 basis points on an organic basis, an excellent performance driven by our top-line growth and [Indiscernible] of IQOS, and pricing combined with operating leverage and productivity savings. Our adjusted diluted EPS grew plus 15.8% organically and plus 20.4% in dollar term; also -- obviously a very strong results. This brings me to guidance for 2021.  We are revising our organic growth outlook for net revenues to plus 6.5% to plus 7%, representing the upper half of the previous range and reaffirming the strong outlook for organic OI margin expansion of around 200 basis points. We also confirm our currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth forecast at the upper end of our previous range, reflecting +13% to +14% growth, or +16% to +17% in dollar terms. This translating to an adjusted diluted EPS range of $6.01 to $6.06, including an estimated sub variable currency impact of $0.17 at prevailing rates. Following on from our most recent comment s, as the tightness in device supplies persist, we now expect our HTU shipment volume to be around 95 billion units as we prioritize devices for user retention. Given the continued growth of HTUs and the need to maintain inventory duration, we continue to expect our full-year shipments to be slightly ahead of IMS volume s. This guidance does not include any material impact of share repurchases or acquisition. Share repurchases through October the 15th amount to around $117 million after some limitation during Q3 from blackout restriction.  In term of other assumptions, we are assuming only a limited Q4 recovery in duty-free following a modest improvement in Q3 with intercontinental and Asian travels still very subdued. We continue to assume fully accomplishable pricing of +2 to +3%, with a softer expected Q4 reflecting continued pandemic-related challenges in certain markets, notably in South and Southeast Asia, as well as tough comparison in Germany and Australia. Lastly, in 2021, we continue to expect around $11 billion of operating cash flow at prevailing exchange rate subject to year-end working capital requirements.  We also update our expectation for full-year capital expenditures to around $0.6 billion reflecting latest launch plans and pandemic related planning factors. Before discussing depth, I am pleased to report some recent positive regulatory development further to the shares in previous quarters. For example, Switzerland adopted a new federal law on tobacco products and in cigarettes defining dedicated product category and differentiated as warnings. In New Zealand, the government has now published new regulation for smoke-free product, which allow branded packaging to be reintroduced with a specific text as warning.  In Egypt, earlier this year, smoke-free product were clearly differentiated from combustible cigarette in both Fiscal and regulatory treatment. There is a growing body of scientific and real-world evidence of the substantial risk reduction potential of non-combustible alternative compared with smoking. While fluctuations across different market are to be expected, we continue to support regulatory and Fiscal frameworks that recognize this critical [Indiscernible] reduction opportunity. Turning back now to our results, Q3 total shipment volume increased by plus 2.1% and by plus 1.5% year-to-date.  This reflect continued strong growth from HTU of +24% driven by the EU region, Japan, Russia, Ukraine, and encouraging progress from recently launched markets in the Middle East. HTU shipments were around 1 billion units below IMS volume for the third quarter, primarily reflecting timing around the August ILUMA launch and the October tax driven price increase in Japan. We expect this dynamic to reverse in Q4. The minus 0.4% decline in our Q3 cigarette volumes reflect the continued sequential recovery of total industry volume and of our market share.  Due to the impressive performance of IQOS, heated tobacco unit comprised 13% of our total shipment volume year-to-date as compared to 11% in full-year 2020, 8% in 2019, and 5% in 2018. Our sales mix is changing rapidly, putting us on track to achieve our aim of becoming a majority smoke-free Company by 2025. Smoke-free product made up almost 30% of our adjusted net revenue year-to-date compared to 23% for the same period in 2020, IQOS devices, accounted for over 6% of the $6.7 billion of RP net revenue. With a step-up in Q3, reflecting the IQOS into my launch, which outweighed the effects of supply constrain on other acquisitions. The plus 7.3% organic growth in year-to-date net revenues on shipment volume growth of plus 1.5% reflect the twin engines driving our top-line.  The first is pricing on combustible and, in certain markets, on HTUs. Second is the increasing mix of HTU s in our business at higher net revenue per unit, which continues to deliver substantial growth and increasingly powerful driver as our transformation accelerates. Let me now go into the driver of our year-to-date margin expansion starting with growth margin which expanded by 240 basis points on an organic basis.  While expansion was lower in Q3 as ILUMA devices were shipped to Japan for the launch, the multiple positive [Indiscernible] discussed in prior quarters continue. Our significant effort on manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies are also bearing fruits with around $450 million of gross productivity savings benefit. This was accompanied by robust SG&A efficiencies with our adjusted year-to-date marketing, administration, and research costs, 40 basis points lower as a percentage of adjusted net revenue on an organic basis. This reflects the ongoing digitalization and simplification of our business processes including our IQOS commercial engine and more efficient ways of working partly offset by increased commercial investment in Q3. With SG&A saving of more than $200 million before inflation and reinvestment, this mean we have generated over $650 million in overall growth efficiencies year-to-date.  This is strong progress toward the combined target of $2 billion for 2021, 2023. Moving to market share, sequential gains for both our IQOS and combustible portfolios give us strong momentum going into Q4 and next year, despite an approximate [Indiscernible] 3 points year-over-year drag in Q3 from market mix. Importantly, we expect further improvement in the fourth quarter for HTU s with record shares across key IQOS geographies.  For combustible, the improving total market volume backdrop includes notable recovery in Indonesia, Turkey, and Mexico, and close to stable Q3 industry volumes in the EU region. Our share of the combustible category has strongly recovered on a sequential basis, moving us one step closer to our target of stable share as our portfolio initiatives bear fruit and pandemic-linked restrictions recede in many markets. In South and Southeast Asia, renewed COVID -linked measures have somewhat dampened the recovery. Though industry volume have nonetheless improved sequentially in Indonesia and in the Philippines where the year-over-year trend is impacted by a challenging prior-year comparison. Our share in the region grew sequentially albeit less than expected, primarily given pandemic-related development in the Philippines. Let's now turn to the tightness in device supply due to the global semiconductor shortage. As we communicated in September, with demand continuing to grow, this has already affected the availability and assortment of IQOS devices in certain markets in Q3, which impact our ability to run at full commercial and competitive capacity and fulfill consumer demand.  Device shipment outside Japan were limited to a 7% year-over-year increase, significantly below the growth in net sales. This resulted in slower user growth of several 100,000 in the quarter notably in Russia, given limitation on the IQOS to the 4 plus device as flagged in recent communication. At this stage, semiconductor supply forecasting remains volatile so we assume the tight supply situation will persist into the first half of 2022. We will continue to carefully prioritize necessary device replacement for existing users, followed by device sales targeted at acquisition.  The successful start of IQOS ILUMA in Japan confirmed it would be a significant driver of acquisition and retention. Nonetheless, at the beginning it triggers significant upgrades from existing large IQOS user base, many of whom don't really needed to replace their devices. This is a highly desired consumer behavior in normal supply [Indiscernible], but increases constraint in the shortage. Therefore, we now assume that additional major launches would only take place in the second half of next year. Given this evolving situation, we have continued important commercial investment in key area.  This include portfolio expansion and product launches such as IQOS ILUMA in Japan and IQOS VEEV, smoke-free category, understanding and awareness campaign, and a number of commercial development project. Including the investment already made in Q3, we anticipate around $300 million of incremental H2 spending compared to the first half. Overall, this is a temporary phenomenon and with demand remaining strong, we expect user growth to reaccelerate once shortages ease. We have a pipeline of exciting innovation on devices and consumable, including but not exclusive to ILUMA, and a number of new market entries plan. However, there are short-term shortage scenario under which the transitory supply impact on user growth could result in 2022 organic growth below our 2021, 2023 targeted average rate for net revenues, OI margin expansion, and adjusted diluted EPS. Nonetheless, with a strong 2021 as a base and a robust reacceleration port shortage, we confirm our confidence in our 2021-2023 growth targets. Moving now to IQOS performance, we estimate there were 20.4 million IQOS users as of September the 30th. Excluding the impact of international sanction in Belarus, this reflect growth of around 0.4 million user s in the quarter with the rate of growth subdued by the tightness of device supply and the time needed to adjust our commercial programs. As demonstrated again by the ILUMA launch in Japan, the underlying momentum of the IQOS brand remains strong.  Following adjustment of our program and assortment, we expect Q4 user growth to improve by a few 100,000 compared to the growth seen in Q3. The reduce user growth for the second half should therefore be broadly consistent with the potential 2 to 3 billion HTU impact flagged in recent communications. We estimate that 73% of total user or 14.9 million adult smokers have switched to IQOS and stopped smoking with the balance in various stages of conversion. The user growth again reflect acquisition across key IQOS geography, despite device constraint. In the EU region, third quarter share for each reached 5.3% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume plus 1.4 points higher than Q3 last year. As mentioned last quarter, we expect a sequential share for HTU s to be broadly stable due to the effect of seasonality and pandemic-related fluctuation on the combustible market. Underlying IMS growth trends remain excellent. And as in the prior year, we expect a strong Q4 in both volume and market share terms. This very good performance includes strong growth across the region with Italy, Germany, and Poland as notable contributors. Robust performance continued in Russia with our Q3 HTU share by plus 1.1 point, to which 6.9%, while lower than Q2, notably due to the seasonality of the combustible market, we expect further sequential growth in IMS to deliver strong quarterly share increase in Q4 as in the prior year. We had the largest limitation on lower-priced devices and related commercial programs in Russia.  And we have seen some increased consumer trial of discounted competitor offering a disposable e-vapor product. However, we continue to see high interest in the category and with both our existing price tier portfolio and future innovation supporting our clear category leadership, we see ample room for further strong growth over time.  There is also [Indiscernible] H2 growth across the eastern Europe region with Ukraine, Kazakstan, and southeast Europe contributing. This slide shows the positive overall regional growth trend in adjusted IMS albeit somewhat dampened on a sequential basis by the halting of shipments to Belarus due to International sanction and timing factor in Kazakhstan. In Japan, the adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by plus 2 points versus the prior-year quarter due to 20.8%, and adjusted IMS grew sequentially to reach a record high of 8.2 billion units, reflecting the strength of our portfolio and the launch of IQOS ILUMA. Adjusted sequential share fell by 0.2 point sequentially, reflecting volatility in the total market ahead of the October the 1st excise increase in addition to normal seasonality. While consumer pantry loading effect may wait on Q4 IMS, we expect further robust underlying growth in volume and a nice sequential improvement in market share. The overall heated tobacco category continues to grow, making up almost 30% of the adjusted total Japanese tobacco market in Q3 with IQOS maintaining a high share of segment and capturing the majority of the category's growth.  In addition to strong growth in existing markets, we continue to drive the geographic expansion of our smoke-free product as we aim to be in one other market by 2025. During the quarter, we launched IQOS in Egypt, the first in Africa, and reached an off-take exit share of 2% in Europe and Cairo. We also now add Norway and Iceland, where our recent acquisition of [Indiscernible] gives us a presence in the [Indiscernible] and nicotine pouch category. This take the [Indiscernible] snooze total number of markets where PMI smoke-free product are available for sale to 70 of which 28 are in low and middle-income market, which we are introducing as more robust measure of making smoke-free product available to adult smoker in emerging countries.  Again, we may have some delays in this market expansion program in the first half of 2022. Given our smoke-free leadership and global reach, let me pause and share a few words regarding the strength of our intellectual property. Across all our smoke-free product, we have strong patent and as being the clear leading innovator in the tobacco category over recent years, investing billions of dollars in the process.  Despite attempts to disrupt our business through litigation by your competitor who lags behind on R&D and innovation. We have been -- you need us to be successful in defending our product against IP challenges in all 11 ruling outside of the U.S. Including the UK high court and at the European Patent Office. The U.S.A. -- the U.S. ITC is a federal agency which, among other things, deals with import, trained to ensure domestic industry of U.S. intellectual property rights. We also note the two paths I mentioned in the ITC final determination were both drafted after IQOS had been launched. The FDA, fulfilling the exclusive [Indiscernible] interest mandate given to it by Congress for tobacco product, has already found that IQOS is appropriate for the promotion of public health and expected to benefit the health of the population as a whole. We are hopeful in the current presidential review period that the U.S. Trade Representative will consider the impact on current American IQOS users and the many more that would be denied access. In the scenario where the ITC determination is upheld, where the financial impact of this time is in material, given the early stage of the U.S. IQOS fallout, this would unfortunately meaning that U.S. consumers would be unable to buy IQOS for a bit of time. Meanwhile, our contingency plans are underway and include domestic manufacturing.  The U.S. patent office is also reviewing certain claim of the patents in question with initial ruling expected in 2022, and by subject to an appeal process. While the ITC ruling may cause near-term disruption to the U.S. availability of IQOS, we continue to see a large opportunity for IQOS in the United States over the coming years. The global IQOS innovation story took a historic step forward in August with the launch of two ILUMA devices and a range of [Indiscernible] HTUs in Japan. Building on the success of IQOS 3 Dual, we believe the simple and intuitive device will support easier switching and higher conversion for [Indiscernible] edge smoker using SmartCore internal induction heating technology.  While -- with the national roll -out taking place at the start of September, initial results were outstanding with device sales well ahead of all comparable past launches at the same stage despite some limitation on device availability and the proportion of new users growing to 18%. [Indiscernible] purchases are growing rapidly, exiting the quarter at over 10% of total PMI HTU of tech volume. Consumer feedback has also been very positive, with meetings increases in the net [Indiscernible].  Following the success, we plan to launch in our second market of Switzerland next month and look forward to additional major launches in 2022 when circumstances allow. We continue to commercialize IQOS VEEV with good progress in the first group of markets, where we started in our own channels with a limited range of taste variants and nicotine levels. IQOS VEEV is a premium product, providing a superior experience. And the commercial infrastructure of IQOS allows it to deploy efficiently and at scale through a bespoke route-to-market approach. As we start to expand distribution and the consumable offering, we see sign of increased uptake and clear positive consumer feedback related to competitive products. We see encouraging early success in Italy where VEEV reached an estimated 7% national exit volume of tech share of crude system product -- system put, sorry, despite not yet being available nationally.  And in the Czech Republic with an estimated 8% national volume of tech exit share. We also launched in Croatia in Q3, Canada in October, and plan to launch in Ukraine before year-end. We also continue preparations to apply for a PMTA from the U.S. FDA in the second half of 2022. Turning now to our strategy to moving to new business areas beyond tobacco and nicotine, which focuses on leveraging and complementing our existing capabilities in the health care and wellness space. We see significant opportunity in adjacent area with our two focused corridors of self-care wellness, including botanicals and inhaled therapeutics, expected to have an addressable market of around $65 billion by 2025.  The acquisitions of Fertin Pharma, Otitopic, and Vectura enabled us to more rapidly expand our development capabilities with over 250 scientists, infrastructure, technology, and expertise in innovative enameled and oral product formulation while continuing to grow CDMO activities. As shown on this slide, this opens up a number of highly complementary opportunities and new focus areas. This acquisition will fully leverage PMI 's existing capability like science, product innovation, and clinical expertise related to innovation. We look forward to updating you more in the future on our plans and progress in these exciting new areas. Moving to sustainability and our ESG priorities, we continue to make good progress throughout our [Indiscernible] through advancing our transformation and addressing our most material impact on society.  We broaden access to our smoke-free product by increasing the availability to adult smoker around the world with new product launches across the growing range of market and smoke-free categories. In addition, our recent acquisition build our human intellectual and social capital, adding smoke-free capabilities and laying the foundation for a strong business in areas beyond tobacco and nicotine, as we strive to develop commercially successful product that seek to have a net positive impact on society. I am proud to highlight the recent publication of our business transformation linked financing framework. And subsequent refinancing of our revolving credit facility. The framework which follows ICMA principal and receive a second party opinion from S&P, links our financing to [Indiscernible] targets in our transformation. Last, we remain on track to achieve carbon neutrality of our direct operation by 2025, five-years ahead of our 2030 target. In addition, with the United Nations Climate Change Conference approaching, we plan to publish a robust, low carbon transition plan and white paper on climate justice, which highlight the connectivity between environmental and social issues. Overall, we are on track for excellent top and bottom-line growth performance in 2021 with strong underlying momentum for IQOS and robust cash generation. We are investing in the broadening of our smoke-free product portfolio and geographic reach. This is critical as we seek to accelerate the number of adult smokers who switched to better alternative with the growing positive impact on society. In addition, we are investing in the capabilities of tomorrow as illustrated by our three recently announced acquisitions, which provide a comprehensive development platform in safe care wellness and in health therapeutic, and strengthen our position in modern oral nicotine.  We have increased cash return to shareholders in Q3 through higher dividend and our share repurchase program in line with our objective to deliver sustainable value and return to investors as we continue our journey towards becoming a majority smoke-free Company. For 2022, we have a pipeline of exciting innovation for both devices and consumable. And we expect IQOS user growth to reaccelerate when device shortages ease. We continue to see a strong future for our business and remain confident in our 2021-2023 organic growth targets. Thank you very much, and I'm now happy to answer your questions. [Indiscernible] So thank you, Guarav, for the question. First of all, let me repeat that this is one scenario, the fact that the constraints are going to stay with us in H1 next year. This is not the only one, so you have more favorable scenario. And at that stage, frankly, it's a fast-moving, super-fluid situation. So we don't know, but I think it was really important to share the possibility that the pressure on availability that we are seeing in H2 2021, we're still going to see it in in H1 2022.  So that's the scenario you are referring to and in this situation we would see after this six months second half of 2021, we'd see another six months period with reduced acquisition that is the underlying potential that we have seen in H1. In this situation, no doubt that, of course, the spending would be impacted by the fact that the number of launches or a number of commercial activities, that's happening, that's very clear. But at the same time, I think we've been very clearly saying it today, we are absolutely sure of the very strong potential of IQOS. And we think that this potential remained absolutely unchanged by what's going on. So there will be when the shortage ease, a very nice acceleration.  On top of that, we will be coming at the same time with very exciting innovation. You know ILUMA, there is more in the pipe. So we're going to make sure even when there is some limitation on availability that we keep building awareness, we keep building the category, but also the IQOS franchise. So not all cost will go away because we're going to -- I mean, we are here to make a success. As you know, on the long time and not managing only 6 months. So yes, there would be in this scenario -- once again it's one scenario, among others. They would be reduction in investment. But as you can see in Q3, we continue to invest even when there is some limitation because we are building this long-term success that is extremely clear in the outlook that we have. Thank you, Guarav, for the question. Let me clarify it again. We have commercial partnership with Altria and each of them tobacco products, so that's very clear. And we're going to see what is the final outcome of this ITC question. I will not rest with the final conclusion. We are at the time of the presidential review. We frankly think it's going to be a defining moment for the objective of the FDA of tobacco on reduction. I think the administration has a great opportunity here to flag how important this tobacco harm reduction policy is. And that would mean to protect IQOS, which is the only [Indiscernible] inhaled nicotine product that is today benefiting from [Indiscernible] in the U.S. So we are still hopeful that we're going to get a positive conclusion after the presidential ruling for us. In the case that it was not the final outcome, of course, we'll continue to work with Altria. The development would be a bit delayed. We'll find a solution to overcome the ITC decision. And we've been flagging the fact that it could go for local production. And, as I think I've been saying during my notes, we remain absolutely convinced of the very strong potential of IQOS in the U.S. So that's one thing. And then you have the other Altria category where indeed we have ambition and you've said it, we are going to file for a PMTA for VEEV.  We could be considering launching modern oral product at a certain point in time as well. And on this one, all the options are open, so we don't have any commercial agreement today. And we will decide in due course how we want to launch and with which kind of set up or partnership. But no decision has been made at that stage. Thank you, Guarav. Hello, Bonnie. Thank you Bonnie. So first question on the IQOS potential in term of sale of device during Q3 without the constraint. We are seeing that we've been missing several 100,000 of sale of devices. So it's obviously very, very material and we've been reporting the fact that outside Japan and really we have to look outside Japan because Japan with the launch of ILUMA was a specific situation. So outside Japan, devices have been growing by 7%, which is, of course, very, very significantly below the underlying growth of our markets.  And we are growing still close to 25% even in Q3. So that I think give an idea of the kind of GAAP that we may have been facing during this quarter. We believe, as I said, that during Q4, as we now have a better, I would say, grip on things, we've been managing on the reassortment, reallotment. We have a better understanding of the kind of commercial actions that are giving the best possible return. We have a very clear view on how we're going to prioritize. So we believe that we are growing even still with the severe restriction on devices, I'm not able to say whether that would be exactly the same level, but let's take that as an assumption, the same level as Q3, we believe that in terms of user growth, we could do better than in Q3. And we mentioned a few 100 thousand better user growth acquisition. So altogether, that mean that if you believe that the [Indiscernible] underlying growth rate was between 4.5 to 5 million user a year that we're seeing in each one, we're going to miss anywhere between 1 to 1.5 million user growth in H2 altogether.  And that is absolutely consistent. So that was something that was already here in September -- at the beginning of September, that is consistent with the 2 to 3 billion impact that we mentioned at the beginning of September. But I hope it helps you have some understanding -- better understanding of the impact of the device shortage. And how you should -- you should see it. On -- we are working, I can tell you, around the clock to manage the shortage. We are using all possible lever. So of course we are in very intense discussion with our suppliers exploring old possibility.  We are dominantly optimizing the planning and of course it's quite complex because we talk about shortages on various type of IC, and they are not all entering into the same kind of reference of our range. So we're managing that as well. We are looking at the split by market as well, and we've been buying a little bit and maybe we could be able to have even more success there. So we are really putting all the lever we can to minimize the impact. And today what we are hearing is that the number of capacity should kick in in the first half of next year. And I would tend to think there is a kind of consensus on the fact that H2 next year should be much better in terms of constraint, if not fully back to normal. So this is an assumption that we have today. But I have to admit that we've seen the situation moving fast, rapidly. And as I said, maybe things are going to improve faster because something is going to happen in the overall demand of the economy in the next six months. So maybe that could be even an improvement in H1. That's a scenario. Does it mean that another scenario that H2 could be with more question mark? Well, maybe. What we are hearing when we talk with our partner and supplier so far. But I have to admit that nothing is totally clear on that stage. Sorry, your line was not very good, but you were asking how we should expect the impact on user acquisition versus volumes, correct? Yeah. Look, we continue to target very nice growth of IQOS and [Indiscernible] is a brilliant category altogether. And of course, as the EPS leader of this category, we see that continuing in the coming quarters. And as you know as well, that is coming with a very nice mix in terms of revenue per stick, and it's still very much visible in our Q3 numbers. And we also flagged the fact that that was positive in terms of gross margin rate for the consumable business, the IQOS business. So maybe if the growth is a bit weaker because of the situation, the positive mix will continue to evolve; has already, but at a lower pace. But that's going to continue to be nicely positive. And on top of that, of course, then there is a question of, okay, what are we going to spend in terms of SG&A in this kind of situation. So it's difficult to say that it's going to be necessarily as in a negative impact on the margin. We are talking about very powerful driver on our financial performance. And even once again, is the growth rate is going to decrease a bit, still going to be significantly higher than any evolution on [Indiscernible]. And it's going to still continue to deliver a positive impact on the mix. Thank you, Bonnie. Good morning. Of course, we can play without limits with that very scenario. We have to admit that we've been seeing already in Q3 a weakening of user growth. And as we said, versus -- even if we expect in Q4 an improvement versus Q3, it will still be below the underlying trend. And then, you know, in the scenario that we are describing, we say if the shortages continue in H1 next year, that's when we're going to face this pressure on growth. So it's difficult for me to just comment one scenario. But [Indiscernible], that's the accumulation of what has been happening in H2 this year, 2021, and what could happen the beginning of next year, so H1 2022, that could drive a reduction in the potential growth rate next year. Which would be temporary once again, and when there is a rebound, the [Indiscernible] will come, but that would be the combination that would trigger something that could be below our average growth targets. So regarding the ITC contingency plan, if eventually the presidential review was not favorable, but I want to repeat before answering you that we are hopeful that this presidential review will have a positive outcome for us for the reason I mentioned previously. I cannot elaborate further, unfortunately, but that clearly -- it's part of what we described, the fact that we could have some local production as an element, but I won't elaborate further on how this could happen and how we would get there. On the ILUMA PMTA, a PMTA, frankly, we will need to have a discussion with the FDA on the process and all the process would be carried by the FDA. And at this stage, I'm not able to answer you. So we will certainly require -- ask for a PMTA on ILUMA at a certain point in time, but not in a position today to comment on timing. Thank you Pam. Good morning, Vivien. Well, there are a number of cases pending, I won't elaborate on that. Not all of them are public. And notably in Europe, I just want to repeat that so far in Europe, we've been on 11 cases, trial or at appeal, we've been successful. So I think it tells a lot about the strength of what we've been doing. And yes, some of the patents on which the ITC based their decision before proceeding for review but then that have been reviewed by a number of courts in Europe. And it to be the UK court. And they already have the [Indiscernible] and the UK court precisely has invalidated two family of patent that are at the original ITC decision. And the European Patent Office already evaluated one of this family of patent, so even fundamentally on the merit of the patent and the validity of the patent, we have been going through success in Europe. Well, you have to still give me the remaining weeks for the year before I can elaborate on next year. I think it's still quite unclear what's going to be the environment. One might think that inflation clearly accelerating in many countries, we'll maybe build a global environment that could be better than what we thought initially, but that's still early time. So I'm not able to comment at that stage, so I will keep a cautious stance, which was built, you probably remember on the aftermath of the COVID and the impact of many economy are being under shock.  So we were seeing that that was probably not making a great landscape for price increase. But I have to admit that I don't know what's going to be the impact coming from what seems to be a general increase in inflation. And maybe that is going to create a more favorable situation, but bear with us, it's still a couple of months before we can have a clearer view on that one. Thanks, Vivien. Hi Chris. Well, Chris, that would mean that we will need to enter into great detail of how we are prioritizing our portfolio, and I don't think I want to do that because, of course, that's quite strategic for us. What is very clear is that we have one, North Star, if you want, which is to first protect our existing IQOS user and to make sure that we make device available when they want to renew the device. And second, of course, we want to optimize any commercial action to make sure that we have the highest return on a new device that we are selling and that we avoid as much as possible selling device with a very low percentage of utilization afterwards by the consumer.  And certainly for us, moving and taking the benefit of that to step up the blade technology and move IQOS 3 as a priority instead of IQOS 2.4+ was one of the moves that we have decided to make. And that explain why we have some more limitation on top of the fact that due to component issue there was also more pressure on 2.4, but obviously in these kind of moment s where a lot of things are on the table, you are managing constraint and long-term strategic vision as well. That's what we're doing. So globally, we think that we have put on beyond nicotine great platforms if you want, and notably in term of R&D. And I think there is a lot we're going to be able to do already with this acquisition. Now, does it mean that in the future, we could think of other [Indiscernible] acquisition that would bring additional capacity that we don't have here maybe, but I think for the time being, we're going to focus on making sure that we integrate this acquisition and we maximize the synergy. In the interview as I said, in terms of R&D, which were really two big objectives to combine strengths on R&D. And we optimize by putting -- know our all skills, talent together, we optimize what we can do already in therapeutic, but I could make the comment as well for 13 and self - care wellness. Nothing. No, absolutely. Nothing has changed on our buyback program. Absolutely. Thank you. Well, on Germany what I can certainly you repeat is the fact that it's a mixed feelings about the German decision because on one side, we are very happy with such a prominent country as Germany, putting in allows the fact that this project are better and should be treated differently than cigarette, and I think it's really great that this tobacco harm reduction principle is recognized. At the same time, 20% differentials seem too low. Yes of course it will have impact as we are progressively impacted by it.  And it's too early for me to give an idea of what's going to be the impact next year. But there will be some impact of course, [Indiscernible] it's not going to derail our fundamentally the trajectory on IQOS and profit growth. But we believe that 20% is not enough. So we are hopeful that at a certain point in time and it's too early to say, of course, the new coalition is yet form, even if things are getting clarified.  But we know whether there is the possibility that starting from these 20% differential. There is a plan to grow it over time, and that could be a possibility. Now, in term of contagion, we don't see that today. We see, on the contrary, when we look at the latest country, they are now coming to a differentiated treatment when it comes to each of them versus CC, we see normally most of the cases significantly higher even, differential versus Germany. So more than 20%. If I take just one example, that's the case in Egypt for instance. So in the recent decision taken by authorities, they are clearly making a bigger difference, which I think to a large extent is much more in line with the reduction in exposure to toxicans. You have a 90 to 95% if you wanted to have a rule to determine what could be the difference. Well, maybe that should be the guideline. And I think we are happy to see a number of country, regulatory government moving to the differentiated treatment between CC and [Indiscernible] and taking a big difference on tax treatment. Thank you. Yes. Thank you, Nick. Just give me a moment to wrap up with some brief closing comments. First of all, 2021 is on track to be a great year for the growth of IQOS and the financial performance of our business. We see continuation of strong underlying fundamentals, demand, and momentum for the IQOS brand. And last, but certainly not least, despite near-term challenges with device supply, we remain on track for our 3-year growth targets supported by a rich innovation pipeline. So thank you very much for your time today and we look forward to talking to you soon. Thank you. Talk to you soon. Bye-bye."

Emmanuel?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. I hope everyone listening to the call is safe and well. Our business delivered a very strong performance in the second quarter of 2021, coming slightly ahead of our expectations to match Q1's record high quarterly adjusted diluted EPS of $1.57 despite the continued challenges of the global pandemic.  Most impressive was the continued strong growth of IQOS, which made up 13% of our volumes and nearly 30% of our adjusted net revenues compared to 24% in the prior-year quarter. HTU shipment volumes grew plus 30% and plus 12% compared to the same quarter last year and the previous quarter sequentially to reach 24.4 billion units with strong growth across key geographies.  We also continued converting adult smokers at a good pace surpassing an estimated 20 million users, of which almost 15 million have switched to IQOS and stopped smoking. Combustible net revenues grew by plus 4% in Q2 on an organic basis, reflecting a partial volume rebound against a weak prior year quarter and solid pricing partly offset by market mix.  Our adjusted operating income margin expanded significantly in both the second quarter and first half overall, and while we expect commercial investments to step up in the second-half, this puts us firmly on track for a strong 2021 performance organically with an expected currency tailwind providing additional growth in dollar terms.  Importantly, this outlook also allowed us last month to confirm our share buyback program, where we target $5 billion to $7 billion over 3 years. We are also delighted to announce that IQOS ILUMA, the next-generation of IQOS, will be launched in Japan next month.  As we covered at Investor Day in February, this represents a major step in category innovation as we seek to accelerate our journey toward a smoke-free future. With regard to long-term growth, we also took important steps to build our modern oral and beyond nicotine business in recent weeks through the proposed acquisition of Fertin Pharma and Vectura, which I'll come back to later.  Turning to the headline numbers, our Q2 adjusted net revenue grew by plus 11.6% on an organic basis, or around plus 18% in dollar terms. This reflects both the recovery of the combustible business in many markets compared to the heavily disrupted second quarter of 2020, including the need for higher inventory levels and the continued strength of IQOS with plus 35% organic growth in RRP net revenue.  For combustible, while certain geographies and channels remain significantly affected by the pandemic, notably in South and Southeast Asia, South America, and global duty-free, re-openings in much of the world have led to partial recovery in social occasion and a sequential recovery in our market share.  We witnessed good organic growth of plus 5.1% in our net revenue per unit, driven by the increasing weight of IQOS in our sales mix and pricing on both combustible and RRPs. Our adjusted operating income margin increased by 270 basis points on an organic basis.  This reflects the increasing weight and profitability of IQOS, higher combustible volume, the positive impact of pricing, productivity savings including lower device costs and lower commercial spend due to the pandemic.  Our resulting adjusted diluted EPS of $1.57 represent plus 17.8% organic growth and plus 21.7% in dollar terms, a very strong performance. Looking at the first half overall, our adjusted net revenues grew by almost plus 12% in dollar terms, and by plus 7.1% organically.  This was achieved despite the tougher Q1 comparison and reflects the Q2 factors I just mentioned, and the consistent growth of IQOS where progress throughout the pandemic has been impressive, notably including the doubling of users in the EU region since the end of 2019.  We delivered strong organic growth of nearly plus 6% in our net revenue per unit, again reflecting our shifting business mix and pricing. Our H1 adjusted operating income margin increased by 440 basis points on an organic basis. While we plan to increase commercial investments in the second half, as we noted at Q1, this remains an excellent performance.  Our H1 adjusted diluted EPS grew plus 19.6% organically and plus 25.6% in dollar terms, also a very strong result. This brings me to guidance for 2021. We now expect an even stronger organic performance for the year than previously supported by improved total industry volume for combustible following the easing of pandemic restrictions.  For net revenue, we are revising our organic growth forecast to between plus 6% and plus 7%, representing the upper end of the previous range. We continue to expect organic adjusted OI margin expansion of around plus 200 basis points, and we are raising our organic adjusted diluted EPS growth range to plus 12% to plus 14%, or plus 15% to plus 17% in dollar terms.  We also continue to expect HTU shipment volumes of between 95 billion and 100 billion units. Given the strong momentum across our market, the need to maintain inventory duration and preparation for the roll out of IQOS ILUMA, which uses different consumables, we expect our full-year HTU shipment to be slightly ahead of IMS volumes.  This projected organic EPS growth, including an estimated favorable currency impact of approximately $0.18 at prevailing rates, translates into an increased adjusted diluted EPS range of $5.97 to $6.07. This guidance does not include any material impact of share repurchase or acquisitions.  We recently received Board authorization for the launch of our three-year share repurchase program where we target $5 billion to $7 billion starting in the period following our Q2 earnings release. Please note this program is not affected by the proposed acquisitions of Fertin Pharma or Vectura.  Turning now to some of the key H2 assumptions underpinning the guidance. We assume that many of our key markets will have largely emerged from COVID restrictions, supporting better industry volume.  Where significant pandemic-related challenges remain, notably Indonesia, the Philippines, and certain markets in South America, we assume no significant further deterioration from the present situation. We continue to assume no meaningful recovery in duty-free this year with Intercontinental and Asian travel still subdued.  A rebound in travel within custom areas such as the European Union has limited effect. In addition, following combustible pricing of around plus 3% in the first half, we anticipate a somewhat softer second half progression. We continue to expect the full-year volumes to be plus 2% to plus 3%.  This reflects continued pandemic-related challenges in certain market, notably in South and Southeast Asia. H2 also faces tough pricing comparison from the 2020 VAT reduction in Germany and new excise tax terms in Australia. The global semiconductor shortage continues to put constraints on device supply.  And while the overall impact remains manageable, we have adjusted our device assortment to limit the effect on consumer availability. This dynamic is included in our guidance, and we continue to monitor the situation closely.  Despite these factors, we have multiple growth drivers in our business, and we are confident in our ability to deliver continued robust, top-line progress. This revenue assumption includes higher expected device shipments and the launch of IQOS ILUMA, which will contribute to less gross margin expansion compared to the first half.  As mentioned previously, we will also step up our commercial investment in key areas, including portfolio expansion and product launches such as IQOS ILUMA and IQOS VEEV, smoke-free category understanding and awareness campaign, and a number of commercial development projects. We anticipate around $300 million to $400 million of incremental spending, compared to the first half, which will impact our H2 OI margin, but overall, still expect to deliver a very robust expansion of around plus 200 basis points for the year. For Q3, specifically, we expect EPS of $1.50 to $1.55. Lastly, we continue to expect around $11 billion in 2021 operating cash flow at prevailing exchange rates and subject to year-end working capital requirement.  Before discussing our results in more depth, I want to highlight some of the positive regulatory development in the quarter. Recognition of the harm reduction potential of smoke-free product continues to gain traction.  Example in recent weeks includes the passing of a broad, differentiated regulatory framework for RRP by the Philippines House of Representative, and the institution of differentiated excise treatment for heated tobacco product in Pakistan. In Mexico, the ban on the import and export of Electronic Nicotine Delivery System no longer applies to heated tobacco devices, which will allow us to resume imports of IQOS devices.  While we are encouraged that the German government has recognized the important principle of differentiation between combustible cigarette and smoke-free product on the basis of potential health impact, we view the announced excise tax changes on heated tobacco as misguided, providing less incentive for consumer to switch away from cigarette to less harmful alternatives.  We also note the differing views among the key political groups in the country ahead of the fall election, and we are hopeful a new government could revisit the decision. In the EU marginarily, we remain optimistic, that the revision of the tobacco excise directive will lead to greater hamornization in the scriptural approach to non-combustible product, taking into account the relevant good practices and experience gained by member states.  Turning back now to our quarterly results. Q2 total shipment volume increased by plus 6.1% and by plus 1.1% for H1. This reflects continued strong growth from HTU s of plus 30% to reach 24.4 billion unit in Q2, driven by the EU region, Japan, Russia, Ukraine, and encouraging progress from recently launched market in the Middle East. HTU shipments were around 1.4 billion units ahead of IMS volume for the second quarter, reflecting the need to maintain inventory duration in the growing business, sea freight lead times, and the first shipment of ILUMA consumable.  The plus 3.2% growth in our Q2 cigarette volume reflects the recovery of a number of key markets compared to a notably week prior-year quarter when pandemic-related disruption was at its peak. While our cigarette share improved sequentially, we continue to face some specific market share headwind in addition to market mix effect, which I'll come back to.  Due to the impressive performance of IQOS Heated Tobacco Units comprised 13.3% of of our total shipment volume in it's run as compared to 11% in the year of 2020, 8% in 2019, and 5% in 2018. We expect this proportion to grow over time as a positive momentum on IQOS continues, providing a powerful driver of revenue and margin growth.  Our sales mix is changing rapidly, putting us on track to achieve our aim of becoming a majority smoke-free Company by 2025. Smoke-free product made up nearly 30% of our adjusted net revenue in the quarter and in H1, compared to 23% in H1, 2020. IQOS devices accounted for approximately 5% of the $4.4 billion of RRP net revenues, reflecting longer replacement time and fewer second device purchase for existing user due to improving battery life, functionality and reliability, and lower device prices in certain markets as we prepare for IQOS ILUMA.  The plus 7.1% organic growth in Net1 net revenue on shipment volume growth of plus 1.1% reflect the twin engines driving our topline. First is pricing on combustible and in certain market on HTU net of the lower device pricing I just mentioned.  Second, the increasing mix of HTU s in our business at IO Net revenue per unit continues to deliver substantial growth, and as explained at Investor Day, this is an increasingly powerful driver as our transformation accelerates.  Let me now go into the driver of our first half margin expansion, starting with gross margin, which expanded by plus 340 basis points on an organic basis. This is driven by multiple levers, as explained in prior quarters, including the mixed effect on HTU and pricing across our portfolio. Our significant effort on manufacturing and supply chain efficiency are bearing fruits, more than offsetting the effect of combustible volume declines, with around $300 million of gross productivity saving delivered in H1.  This represent a strong start on the journey towards our target of $1 billion over 2021, 2023. This was accompanied by strong SG&A efficiency with our adjusted H1 marketing administration and research cost, 90 basis points lower, as a %age of adjusted net revenue on an organic basis.  This reflects the ongoing digitalization and simplification of our business processes, including our IQOS commercial engine and more efficient ways of working. We delivered around $120 million towards our 2021, 2023 target of $1 billion in growth SG&A savings before inflation and reinvestment.  Focusing now on combustible, we hold the leading international portfolio by market share and by brand strengths. This give us a formidable platform to accelerate the growth of IQOS via our commercial infrastructure, industry expertise, and ability to communicate with adult smoker where permitted.  It is therefore important to maintain our leadership through selective investment, as we also drive return through pricing and efficiency. Despite good results in markets like Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, our Q2 cigarette share remained below the prior year, with over half of the share loss due to market mix, reflecting our high exposure to market, like the Philippine and low presence in certain emerging markets with strong rebound, such as Bangladesh.  Importantly, our share improved sequentially compared to the first quarter and we expect this positive trajectory to continue through the second half. This reflects a partial recovery from the COVID impact on social occasion, where Marlboro over-indexes, border closures, and travel.  However, the expected recovery is also supported by portfolio initiative, including in the value segment and the enduring strength of Marlboro. We continue to target stabilization in our cigarette category share over time, with HTU gains coming on top.  I will know turn briefly to the South and Southeast Asia region. As covered last quarter, after a difficult 2020, notably in Indonesia, volume headwinds have been moderating. However, the pandemic remains a major issue in the region, with renewed lockdowns in a number of areas. Daily consumption patterns are still below pre-pandemic levels, and the pricing environment remains challenging.  We continue to expect volume growth in Indonesia this year as the industry improves, with encouraging recent share gain within the Tier 1 segment where we participate. Our overall share in both Indonesia and the Philippines was sequentially broadly stable in Q2, with our portfolio initiative geared at further share recovery over the balance of the year. In RRPs, IQOS continued to grow strongly in Metro Manila with an exit share of over 1% for HEETS.  For the region overall, we remain on track to deliver positive organic net revenue growth over the April to December period as outlined on our Q1 call. Moving now to IQOS performance, we estimate there were 20.1 million IQOS users as of June 30th.  After the exceptional addition of around plus 1.5 million adult user in the first quarter, we added a further plus 1 million in Q2 and plus 2.5 million year-to-date, building on the step-ups in the second half of 2020. Our accelerated pivot to digital and remote engagement during the pandemic, combined with strong momentum for the IQOS brand is paying off.  We further estimate that 73% of this total of 14.7 million adult smokers have switched to IQOS and stopped smoking, with the balance in various stages of conversion. Strong conversion rates notably reflect the increased prevalence of IQOS 3 DUO, which offers a superior user experience to previous device session. We seek to achieve even higher conversion rate overtime with the introduction of innovation such as IQOS ILUMA.  This user growth, again, reflect widespread momentum across all key IQOS geographies, including the EU region, Japan and Russia. It also reflects the enrichment of our offer and the segmentation of the category with new products and more price points, both above and below our initial HTU offering.  In the EU region, second quarter share for EHTS reached 5.5% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume plus 1.6 points higher than Q2 last year. As mentioned, last quarter we expected sequential share for HTU to be broadly in line with the first quarter due to the effect of seasonality and pandemic-related fluctuation on the combustible market.  Underlying trends remained strong, with Q2 HTU IMS volume growing plus 50% year-over-year, and around plus 11% sequentially when adjusted for estimated trade inventory movements. We expect to see similar dynamic in the third quarter, with broadly stable headline share versus robust underlying growth.  This excellent performance includes strong growth across the region, with Italy and Poland as notable contributors. We continued to grow our EU region IQOS user base, doubling since the start of 2020 despite the pandemic, to reach over 6.3 million.  Strong performance continued in Russia with 8% sequential user growth in Q2, and our HTU share by 1.3 points to reach 7.3%. As in the EU, sequential share can be distorted by the combustible market. Adjusted for estimated trade inventory movement, this reflects close to plus 30% year-over-year IMS growth. After the excellent progress and geographic expansion of IQOS in recent year, the heated tobacco category in Russia is now large and growing. This very positive dynamic naturally attract competition, and as seen before in markets like Japan, heavily discounted competitive offering can generate initial consumer trial. We continue to grow our user base, and with both our existing price tier portfolio and the future launch of IQOS ILUMA, we see ample room for further strong growth.  While we have historically focused on Russia in our earning calls, there is Negative Noise broad HTU growth across the Eastern Europe region with Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Southeast Europe significantly contributing. We show here the excellent overall original growth trend in adjusted IMS.  Note that following recent international assumption, IQOS is no longer available for sale in Belarus where we achieved a Q2 uptake share in means of almost 7%. We continue to see sequential volume growth for both our HEET and Fiit lineup in Russia and Ukraine. Moreover, this solid and fit consumable continued to supplement user acquisition.  In both Russia and Ukraine, the majority of consumer purchasing a LIL device are smokers entering the smoke-free category for the first time, with high level of conversion in line with IQOS, benefiting from our IQOS conversion infrastructure.  With this success, we also introduced LIL SOLID in 5 further market in Eastern Europe this quarter, with additional markets plan later this year. Japan, the adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by plus 2.3 points, that was the prior year quarter, and by 0.2 point sequentially to 21%, highlighting the strength of our pricier portfolio and broad range of [Indiscernible] following the October 2020 price increase. IMS volume adjusted for estimate trade inventory movements grew by around plus 5% sequentially, after accounting for fewer selling days in the first quarter. We continue to expect robust underlying progress in user growth and consumer uptake supported by the launch of IQOS ILUMA in August.  As in prior years, with an additional excise increase in October 2021, there may be volatility on the timing of IMS and consumer uptake between the third and fourth quarters. In H1, the overall heated tobacco category made-up around 29% of the adjusted total Japanese tobacco market, with IQOS maintaining a high share of segment and capturing the large majority of the categories' growth.  In addition to strong growth in existing market, the geographic expansion of our smoke-free product continues. This allows us to provide access to better alternatives to an ever increasing amount of adult smoker, as we aim to be in android market by 2025.  Our second quarter launches in Kyrgyzstan and with Uzbekistan with both IQOS and LIL offerings, take the total number of market where PMI smoke-free product are available for sale to 67, of which over half are outside the OECD. Core driver of our continued success in smoke-free product is innovation.  We are very excited to launch IQOS ILUMA, the next generation of IQOS, next month in Japan. Building on the success of IQOS 3 DUO, we believe this simple and intuitive device will support easier switching and higher conversion for legal age smoker using Smartcore internal induction heating technology. As outlined at Investor Day, ILUMA will come in multiple device formats, and have its own range of HTU consumables.  The ongoing success of IQOS review, almost 2 years after launch, demonstrates that significant innovation can have a lasting positive impact on gross. We plan for further market launches of IQOS ILUMA through the remainder of this year and in 2022.  Naturally, for a major new innovation and as seen with earlier version of IQOS, the unit cost profile of IQOS ILUMA devices and consumable begin at a higher level. but we expect this to improve over time as scale increases. This dynamic is included in our guidance assumptions.  We are continuing to commercialize IQOS VEEV with a good progress in the first group of market, where we started in our own channel with an initially limited range of test variant and nicotine level. IQOS VEEV is a premium product providing a superior experience.  And as we explained previously, the commercial infrastructure of IQOS allows us to deploy efficiently and at scale through a bespoke route-to-market approach. As we start to expand distribution and the consumable offering, we see signs of increased uptake and clear positive consumer feedback relative to competitive product.  We plan to launch in further market later this year, and we'll continue to test edge verification technology in select markets. In addition to heated tobacco and eVapor, we announced in February our intention to enter the small but fast growing nicotine pouch category this year.  To complement our internal development, we have two important acquisition to establish a base of capability in science, technology, and manufacturing, and build our platform in Modern Oral. The first of these was AG Snus completed during the second quarter.  AG Snus has a relatively small branded portfolio of Modern Oral product, which provide us a foothold in the category. In addition, the proposed acquisition of Fertin Pharma will give us access to a range of promising oral delivery technology and capability, some of which could be applied to the modern oral Nicotine space.  We will return with further news on our commercial plans in this area later this year. I also want to come back to our Beyond Nicotine strategy, which we first outlined at Investor Day. We see significant opportunities in adjacent areas with our two-focus corridors of self-care wellness, including botanical, and inner Therapeutic, expected to have an addressable market of around $65 billion by 2025.  The proposed acquisition of Fertin Pharma and Vectura can enable us to more rapidly expand our development capabilities in innovative, in health, and oral product formulation while continuing to grow their respective CDMO activities. Fertin has a range of promising oral delivery technology, including pouches, gum, and lozenges, which can be applied in both the Modern Oral Nicotine and Beyond Nicotine areas, notably for self-care wellness product.  With Vectura, we would gain access to differentiated proprietary technology and pharmaceutical development expertise to deliver a broad range of complex inhaled therapies. Vectura has highly complementary human capital, technology, high quality infrastructure, and deep know-how of inhalable formulation and device design development and analysis, drug device combination, and pharmaceutical management processes and system.  These proposed acquisitions would fully leverage PMI 's existing capability in life science, product innovation, and clinical expertise related to inhalation. Such acquisitions can also enhance our progress on important sustainability priorities. Firstly, building our capabilities in Mordern Oral is a key enabler of broadening the reach and access of our smoke-free alternative to other smoker around the world.  And secondly, building a strong Beyond Nicotine business is a major objective as we strive to develop commercially successful product with a net positive impact on society. On ESG and sustainability, more broadly, we are firm believers in the power of investor engagement to drive positive change.  Given PMI 's unique sustainability and transformation story, we have increased our own outreach. We published our second integrated report in May, which provides the comprehensive detail and transparent disclosure of how we create sustainable value and how we are progressing toward our purpose and target, including our most important commitment of all; to phase out cigarettes.  We also had a dedicated sustainability webcast on June the 2nd, where we covered the fundamental alignment of our transformation and financial performance with addressing our impact on society.  We shared the latest studies using real-world data on a possible association between accelerated cigarette volume decline and certain disease reduction in Japan. We also reaffirm our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion as an essential enabler of future success.  We continue to make progress on our 2025 roadmap with notable development in Q2 being our second certified carbon-neutral factory in Switzerland, taking us one step closer to achieving carbon neutrality by 2025, and the publication of our eco design principal, as we seek to play our part in the secular economy. In closing, after delivering 1% total volume growth and 7% organic revenue growth in H1, we have raised our 2021 organic growth expectation to plus 6% to plus 7% in net revenue, and plus 12% to plus 14% in adjusted diluted EPS.  We are on track for an excellent performance. Moreover, we continue to invest in the future. Most immediately, this means the launch of IQOS ILUMA in Japan next month and in more markets later this year. We are also investing in the broadening of our smoke-free product, Portfolio, and geographic reach.  This is critical as we seek to accelerate the number of adult smokers who switched to better alternative, with the growing positive impact on society. In addition, we are investing in the capabilities of tomorrow as illustrated by our two recent propose acquisition, which provide a comprehensive development platform across our Beyond Nicotine focused areas.  Finally, we are also committed to returning cash to shareholder through dividend and share repurchase in line with our [Indiscernible] to deliver sustainable value and return to investor as we continue to, as we continue our journey towards becoming a majority smoke-free business. Thank you very much. I am no more than happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference. [Operator instructions]. In the interest of fairness and time, we ask that participants keep it to a maximum of two questions each. Our first question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nChris Growe: Hi. Good morning.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Hi, Chris.\nChris Growe: Hi, and nice quarter there. I do want to ask you two questions if I could, please. I want to start first with, you have IQOS ILUMA launching soon in Japan, and I assume you'll go into more markets. I think in this quarter you had shipments above consumption.  Would you expect that still to be the case? I know you've mentioned building inventories. Would that still likely happen in the second half of the year or we've already built inventories sufficiently to handle that launch?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Chris. No, I think there was an element of preparation for the launch in this Q2. For the rest of the year, at that stage, we expect IMS and shipment to be more aligned, so we don't expect to have further material differences at that stage emerging in H2.\nChris Growe: Okay. And just a question on the combustible business, and I know you gave some good detail on that. I guess my question would be that you did have a softer market share overall in combustibles. I think you mentioned you expect your share to stabilize there over time. I just want to get a sense if you thought that you could stabilize your combustible market share this year?  And I think related to that, just to maybe give a little more color around the pricing environment and how competitive it is right now in combustibles, I think there may be factor that's contributed to less pricing for your business in that area.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Sure, Chris. On this objective to stabilize our market share in the CC segment or CC category, that's a clear objective that we have. Of course, it's a year-on-year stabilization that we want to reach. We are stabilizing sequentially quarter-on-quarter, and it's good to see that the Q2 market share is showing this kind of improvement versus Q1.  We are not there yet in terms of stabilization year-on-year. That's an objective that we have gradually for the coming quarters. We'll see when we are able to reach it, but that's clearly something that we want to pursue. On the pricing environment, as you have seen we started nicely the year.  Q2 was still quite good. I would cite in Indonesia, we are reporting a price impact of about 5%, so clearly positive. H2 is more difficult as we've been flagging it in terms of basis of comparison. There was a VAT decrease in Germany. There is a different pattern in excise duty increase in Australia, so that is going to play.  And we are also going to monitor what is the situation as hopefully we are exiting the COVID crisis, which exactly what is the timing and how is the exit, but we know that many economies would still stay quite impacted by that. So, we\u2019ll be of course monitoring the capacity of our customers to follow price increases and that will be certainly driving our decision when it comes to price increases.  So, I would say we're going to monitor the situation. We're going to see what is happening. There would be certainly a question on evolution of inflation here and there as well that we're going to take into account. So, a lot of unknown at this stage, but we'll take that into account to monitor and decide on price increase. Nevertheless, we have been flagging the fact that after a 3% increase in H1, we do confirm the overall bracket of 2% to 3% for the full year, which means that we expect notably and partially because of tougher comps in H2, an H2 that could be less favorable in terms of price increase than H1.\nChris Growe: Thank you for all the perspectives.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler. Piper Sandler. Co.\nMichael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Hi, Michael.\nMichael Lavery: I just wanted to ask a couple of questions on Indonesia. One, it follows on some of the pricing discussions, I guess. You called it out, obviously, as an offset to some of the favorable pricing. Can you just help us understand a little bit better the dynamics there and what to expect looking ahead?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Sure. So remember Indonesia was a very tough market last year, really hit hard by the pandemic. It doesn't mean, unfortunately, that the country has exited the crisis. And until recently, there has been new announcements of lockdown and restrictions. It's probably the impact was so strong last year that we're comparing to probably favorable basis of comparison, but the situation is certainly not back to normal there.  Nevertheless, what we are seeing is certainly an improvement of the situation, again, based on probably favorable comparison. We are doing well ourselves when it comes to the premium market, what we call the Tier 1 with more excise duty, and we are gaining share there, and that explains that we are able to grow our volume this year.  But we are also, unfortunately, at the same time seeing the Tier 2 category, the one enjoying lower taxes, that is still gaining ground and probably getting close to 30% market share. It used to be, at the end of last year, around 25%, 26%. So, that is playing the other way around, and hopefully this is going to be corrected with evolution [ph] on the excise duty policy put in place by the government.  But, of course, we don't have any news on that and we don't know if and when it's going to happen. That is a situation that we are facing. And in Indonesia, there is clearly improvement versus last year. It doesn't mean that the environment, when it comes to possibility of price increase, is becoming favorable, but at least it's no longer the kind of very negatively oriented market that it used to be for us last year.\nMichael Lavery: And just to confirm then on your pricing, are you saying that you're not getting any increases or have you actually lowered prices?\nEmmanuel Babeau: We are impacted by the increase in duty, so we are increasing price, but it's still having a negative impact, and that's why there is a difference between what we are reporting in terms of price impact with Indonesia and without Indonesia. So, overall it's still having a bit of a negative impact.\nMichael Lavery: I got it. So, your increases aren't fully offsetting the duty increase?\nEmmanuel Babeau:  That's correct.\nMichael Lavery: And then just on IQOS in Indonesia, I know you haven't called out a launch there, and the Internet can be a funny creature [ph]. But we find about a dozen stores in Jakarta that all look quite proper and have really official sounding language. Are those resellers of products they are getting somewhere else or do you have a sort of a quiet launch there? Can you just give us a status of how IQOS sits in Indonesia today?\nEmmanuel Babeau: So, there is no official launch of an IQOS club where we may gather some user. As you know, Indonesia is first and foremost a kretek market. And while we certainly have the objective to develop a specific heat-not-burn device for kretek, we haven't been launching it yet.  So, we do that, of course, addressing only part of the population, the one with the purchasing power that can afford the current devices, and also a small group of people that are non-kretek, if you want, smoker but that's a very small fraction of the consumer. So, that could be the element that you are referring to, but there is no offficial global launch, if you want, at that stage.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. Thanks very much.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gaurav Jain from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nGaurav Jain: Hi. Good morning.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Hi, Gaurav.\nGaurav Jain: Hi. A couple of questions from me. One is on the guidance that you had at Investor Day, you know greater than 9% EPS growth over 2021 to 2023, and you are clearly coming quite ahead of that this year at almost 13%. So how should we interpret it is what I'm trying to understand that there is a slowdown in the next 2 years because you have these tax gap closures in Germany which will impact the high cost realization in that market next year and potentially in some other European markets or could be that [multiple speakers] independent --?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Well, thank you for the question, Gaurav. I think you're going too far. We've been sharing this three-year guidance and objective at the time of the Investor Day, more than 9%. We are off to a strong start because we are targeting indeed for the first year 12% to 14%, it's clearly above the 9%, so I think we're compliant for the time being with the overall beyond 9%, and that means that we are certainly on good track to deliver the more than 9%, but I don't see a contradiction between the more than 9% and what you said the new good news, which is the strong start in 2021.\nGaurav Jain: Sure. And there is more of these tax gap closures in Europe, how would that impact your potential to achieve this EPS growth guidance?\nEmmanuel Babea: I mean, of course, you can make whatever scenario, and it's difficult to react to the most extreme scenario. But I think we are taking into account and we have always said that, that there could be some reduction, gradual reduction, to the gap between CC, and even on other product when it comes to excise duties. That is absolutely factored in our guidance. We have the capacity to increase price. We've been repeating the fact that IQOS and the consumable that are coming with IQOS is a premium product, that is already a superior expense for the customer. And that is commanding a premium in terms of price positioning as well. Today, thanks to the lower excise duty, very often you're going to have consumable at a cheaper price than the premium combustible product like Marlboro. That is something that, of course, could be changed and we could increase price. And at the same time, we continue to see more and more governments and regulators saying that there should be a difference between combustible and heat-not-burn because heat-not-burns are better product, and that should be used, certain ly, as an incentive to a smoker switching to heat-not-burn category and to move to better product for them. We certainly believe that there will be some decrease in some country, but it's not going to be necessarily the case everywhere. We could also envisage increase in the gap. We haven't seen that recently in the EU, but we've been seeing that being installed in other country. And on the long term, we continue to believe that there will be still some nice difference between the two that is fully justified by the fact that these are better products. [Indiscernible] to say that we are ready to cover for certainly possible reduction in the gap. We think that some of that is going to happen anyway for sure, Germany being one example. And at the same time, we believe that there will be growing, I would say, consensus on the fact that there should be a clear differentiation between combustible and heat-not-burn product.\nGaurav Jain: Sure. Thank you. If I can ask a quick one on Japan. We have this [Indiscernible] right gap closure, the?task? gap closures in October, and that will throw up a lot of volumes up in the market which will be moving, and you're launching IQOS ILUMA. There is a potential to launch a lower priced IQOS variant, maybe reposition IQOS 3 DUO at a lower price point to capture these volumes from the cigarette low category which will probably move.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Certainly, Gaurav, with IQOS ILUMA, we are going to enrich the premium category for [Indiscernible] product. And as we keep saying, that's going to be a real, I would say, major change for customers, and it's going to represent for them clearly a big, big progress, killing the remaining pinpoints. And therefore, of course we focus on that for the time being. We believe the potential is huge as we've been highlighting. Now, depending on how the market is evolving, certainly we'll see what is the interest of launching new devices with a different positioning. The ultimate goal, as we also said in several instances, is certainly, in any case, to have a full coverage of the spectrum of the market, from the most premium positioning to certainly more value for money designed to cost simple product that are of course delivering an experience that is not at the level of the prime experience, but that is value for money and good enough experience for other type, I would say, of customers So Japan will make no exception in our willingness to cover once again, the full market from premium to medium and even low price positioning.\nGaurav Jain: Thanks a lot.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog, from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nBonnie Herzog: Thank you. Hi, Emmanuel.\nA - Emmanuel Babeau::\nBonnie Herzog: I wanted -- Hi, I wanted to circle back just on guidance. I just have a couple of questions. I -- thinking about this, Ukraine your EPS guidance for the full year, as you expect, industry volumes are improving, but it still does?imply? a decent step-down of growth in the second half despite lapping a relatively easier comp. Now, you did call out a few things, you called out incremental cost associated with the rollout of ILUMA and maybe some gross margin pressures as you expect to sell more devices in the second half. So I just want to make sure I understand all of the puts and takes, or any incremental pressures you're Operating in the second half, half. And then I just wanted to also clarify as it relates to I buybacks. You did mention your guidance doesn't include a material impact from any share buybacks, but just wanted to verify. Does this mean you're not going to be buying back as aggressively, in the second half of this year you're just just including buybacks at all:ot including buybacks at all in the guidance? I just wanted to make sure I understood that.\nEmmanuel Babea: Sure, Bonnie. Very clear. Maybe starting with the buyback to make it clear. No, no, we're not making any kind of guidance on what's going to be the buyback or assumption. As we said, we want to be really, super flexible. And frankly, all scenario for the magnitude of the buyback in H2 can be envisaged. But precisely because we want to keep flexibility, we don't want to put any kind of assumption on the amount of buyback for H2. That's really the way you should understand it. Now on the H2 margin versus H1, because I guess that's really your question. I think you started to summarize well the reason for the different margin evolution profile, but I'm happy to go through all the element. Certainly, what's going to be common between H1 and H2 is strong dynamism in top line with continued favorable evolution, of course, on our IQOS business. We are still facing on the CC business, also, some relatively easy comp last year, so that should have an impact on theour on of our CC business. We continue to have the nice mix impact driven by the IQOS growth on our revenue first week, so that is going to stay. And of course, that's the reason why we are raising the guidance on the revenue organic growth to 6 to 7. It's our confidence on the continuation of strong dynamism on revenue growth in H2. Then on other element that could be different, there is, as I said it answering a previous question on price, we see H2 possibly being more challenging than the 3% price increase on the CC business that we delivered in H1, so that's clearly one element. Another one is the level of productivity. You have seen the number 300 million. In H1, we target 1 billion over a 3-year period. Obviously, the 300 million is not necessarily a sustainable amount if you want for a 6 months period. So there was some front-loaded element in productivity this year. It doesn't mean that we don't intend to generate a nice productivity in H2, but not necessarily at the same level as the 300 million in H1. That's going to be another element. Then there are all the impact of the launch of ILUMA. And I see indeed on the margin to impact, One is the fact that when you launch a new product, it's true for any business, any industry. Your cost are not optimized. You don't have yet the volume to fully amortize all the investment. You haven't been optimizing all your processes. So there will be an impact on the gross margin coming from increased cost as we launch ILUMA. This is going to, of course, disappear overtime. I'm not able to tell you exactly how long it's going to take, but let's say 18 to 24 months is the typical, I would say, horizon to get to full productivity when you have some innovation. This is going to have an impact on H2. Then, we said it as well, the fact that we're going to sell more device, an ILUMA device, that is going to boost revenue, but it's not going to have the same impact as consumable on the gross margin, and, of course, with an impact on the gross margin rate. And last element that I have certainly top of mind, these 300 million to 400 million increase investments in H2 versus H1. me iAnd these investments are going to be obviously where it's going to make an impact for the Company. So it's about innovation, it's about commercial and marketing capacity, it's about digitizing further our business and the Company. That's where we're going to put that money. So you need to take all these elements into account to understand the different profile of margin evolution between H1 and H2. But having said that, obviously, we are still targeting a very nice growth of our revenue OI and adjusted EPS in H2 obviously.\nBonnie Herzog: Okay, that was really helpful and I appreciate all that. Obviously, there's a lot of puts and takes, but broadly, given the raised guidance, you've feel pretty darn good about the momentum and just the improvements in industry volumes. That's encouraging. If I may, I wanted to ask a second question just on the competitive environment, especially as I think about what Japan Tobacco is doing by launching their new Ploom X. And it sounds like they plan to launch it at a pretty steep discount to drive trial. Now, this coincides with the launch of ILUMA in Japan. I just wanted to understand your strategy in terms of positioning ILUMA especially as it relates to price. Maybe overall, how concerned are you with stepped-up competition and how confident are you that you're going to be able to maintain share and ultimately continue to take share? Thanks.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes. Bonnie, Certainly, that's of course a very good question. I happy to elaborate on it. First and foremost, and that's probably the most important in my answer, we are really happy to see competition really taking now the bih tategueyas a big priority. And showing, I think increase commitment engagement beyond the category. We think that the shared vision on the fact that we need jointly to phase out cigarette and develop better product for smokers is a way, certainly, to accelerate the journey to end smoke the world. To see competition realizing that this is a great category, this is answering smokers need and expectation, putting more innovation, more investment there in the category, that's just great. And I think we can start seeing in some geography where competition increase investment, we can see the overall growth of the market accelerating. And of course, as we take a lion's share of that, that is very good news. Having said that, obviously, what is important for the smoker is the capacity to find with it heat-not-burn tech nology and proposal. Something that is mimicking, to the closest way possible, the experience versus combustible cigarette. And that's where our technology, our capacity to innovate, is making a big difference. And that's where probably some of the competition is struggling a little bit, and that is the reason why some of them believe that they have to discount their product to get some traction. So what does it generate? At the end of the day, it generates the fact that you may have a trial because the device is coming almost for free, the consumable is cheaper. But then if it's not satisfactory, if it doesn't provide the same pleasure, the same benefit as what you have with an IQOS experience and we love further more with IQOS ILUMA, then whether you switch back to IQOS, or you may just be back to combustible cigarette because as you're feeling that that's not satisfactory versus what you really enjoy. And therefore, it's not whether playing the role of converting smokers to heat-not-burn, and you create lot -- lower average consumption device and lower loyalty. So we continued to be a firm believer that at the end of the day, just the right technology, the right experience will convert the majority of the smokers to switch to better product and to heat-not-burn category. And we believe that this is exactly what we are offering with IQOS. And that make us confident on our capacity to retain big market share. It doesn't mean that we're not going to propose also, simpler device, always with our capacity to innovate. Targeting, as I said, different purchasing power, different expectation. But certainly we will continue to lead the way when it comes to a premium product delivering a superior experience.\nBonnie Herzog: Alright, very helpful again, thank you so much for all of that.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Bonnie. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Pamela Kaufman, from Morgan Stanley.\nPamela Kaufman: Hi. Good morning.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Hi, Pamela.\nPamela Kaufman: I was hoping that you could elaborate on your plans for increased investment in the second half in terms of what initiatives you will be spending behind, how much will be for ILUMA versus VEEV or the other reduced risk offerings. And then in terms of the level of spending, the $300 million to $400 million, is that primarily related to the launch in Japan? And should we think about annualizing this level of incremental investment for next year as you expand into additional markets?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Pamela. I have to say, I fully understand your curiosity and that you want to know more about this extract in order to form an opinion. But I'm afraid I will have to disappoint you because, as you can imagine, that is super sensitive and we don't want to disclose the detail of that. Nevertheless, I'm certainly happy to say that we are putting investment in places that are going to move top-line, i.e. growing more volume, more conversion on a smoker switching to IQOS. Certainly, part of the amount is going to be behind the launch of IQOS ILUMA. But not only, there are also commercial activity. As we see, a number of markets returning to a certain normalcy. I will not say we are fully there, but certainly more reason to reaccelerate a number of marketing and commercial activity. And that's going to be important. We are also accelerating in term of innovation, and we are putting more money in life science and to build more presence in RRP category notably, so that's part of the accelaration. And we also signal it's going to be much more marginal, but that we may have to very selectively reinvest here and there on CC where it's possible. I would say it's going to be a small fraction of the extra investment, butt we have this objective of stabilizing our market share. So I think with that, Pamela, you have really what is behind the 300 million to 400 million. No, you don't need to necessarily annualize that, but let's be clear we're going to launch ILUMA in many more country next year in 2022. And And I'm not able to elaborate at that stage on what's going to be the plan in term of investment, but I would expect that, yeah, we'd certainly want to invest with a great return on this new offering and new technology. S that would have some impact on our investment next year. Remember, nevertheless, we have a very ambitious program to generate 1 billion efficiency on S G&A. We have ambition to be very dynamic on revenue. And therefore, our goal over a three-year period is to reduce nicely the SG&A on revenue ratio to create a driver for increased profitability. And of course, including all this investment that absolutely remained a big ambition that we have.\nPamela Kaufman: Thank you. That's very helpful. And my other question is, can you discuss the rationale behind the new management structure in the America s? I'm just curious how, if at all, it influences the Company's priorities in the region. Should we anticipate any changes to the way that IQOS ' U.S. rollout is conducted, or any changes in the Company's strategy towards the U.S. market, particularly given that Deepak Mishra 's background is in strategy and M&A?.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Well, thank you for highlighting the great talent of Deepak and we're all very pleased to see him taking his new responsibility. I think it just highlights, certainly, the potential that we see globally for Americas but notably, of course, for the U.S. We want to keep working in close interaction with Altria on IQOS. We flagged the fact that we could have, certainly, for IQOS VEEV some ambition. You will allow me not to elaborate more on that, but that certainly mean that we see the U.S. as actually a country where reduced risk product have a great potential and we want to participate in that potential.\nPamela Kaufman: Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: You're welcome.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Vivien Azer from Cowen. Please, go ahead.\nVivien Azer: Hi. Good morning. Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Hi Vivien.\nVivien Azer: Hi. My first question is on VEEV. I was wondering if you could expand and offer any preliminary insights. I know that it's still early days, but for the consumers that are engaging with that product, are they skewing towards legacy IQOS consumers, are they newer IQOS consumers, new consumers to the platform in general? Any other insights would be very helpful. Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Sure, Vivien. Indeed, we -- on VEEV, this is what I could call a soft launch for a number of reason. We want to learn the category. We are learning in many dimension including age verification, which we see as absolutely paramount. And the obvious initial move from us was to put VEEV as the nice complement for some of the already IQOS [Indiscernible] been user in the case of polyusage. And that was a natural move from people who were knowledgeable of IQOS already, the technology, the great experience the IQOS brand can provide. I think we are moving now to new dimension. We have beyond this initial move some great feedback coming from consumer that show that it's not only the elegance of the design, but the overall experience, the quality of the product that is comparing very well when we do test versus competitors. So time to certainly accelerate in our ambition that will come with more launches, of course, development of more flavors. So after this first step in the category, you should expect us to certainly increase ambition on vaping.\nVivien Azer: Perfect. Thank you. And my followup question is just on capital allocation. It's been a while since we've seen the Company be this acquisitive. In short order, do you feel comfortable that you've filled white space or knowledge gaps in your portfolio, or should we expect more bolt-on acquisitions going forward? Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: My view would be, Vivien, that with the proposed acquisition of Fertin and Vectura, we would certainly really build a very strong platform on which for our 2 ambitions on inhale therapeutic and on self-care wellness, we would have indeed very strong platform, and notably from life science perspective. For the life science, that would be great. That's certainly the view that we have today on that topic.\nVivien Azer: Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will turn it back over to management for closing remarks.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Alright. Well, let me leave you with some key messages then. First, despite the slower recovery from pandemic in certain markets, we are happy to report a very robustful first half performance with a record high adjusted diluted EPS and raised 2021 guidance. Second, the impressive growth of IQOS continues. And we remain on track to deliver our target of 95 to 100 billion units for the year. Third, our Combustible Business is improving sequentially as the recovery from the pandemic infraction in many key markets. Lastly, we are building towards important milestone in our Beyond Nicotine strategic vision, as part of our business transformation. Thank you again for joining us and talk to you soon.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "I mean, of course, you can make whatever scenario, and it's difficult to react to the most extreme scenario. But I think we are taking into account and we have always said that, that there could be some reduction, gradual reduction, to the gap between CC, and even on other product when it comes to excise duties. That is absolutely factored in our guidance. We have the capacity to increase price. We've been repeating the fact that IQOS and the consumable that are coming with IQOS is a premium product, that is already a superior expense for the customer. And that is commanding a premium in terms of price positioning as well. Today, thanks to the lower excise duty, very often you're going to have consumable at a cheaper price than the premium combustible product like Marlboro. That is something that, of course, could be changed and we could increase price. And at the same time, we continue to see more and more governments and regulators saying that there should be a difference between combustible and heat-not-burn because heat-not-burns are better product, and that should be used, certain ly, as an incentive to a smoker switching to heat-not-burn category and to move to better product for them. We certainly believe that there will be some decrease in some country, but it's not going to be necessarily the case everywhere. We could also envisage increase in the gap. We haven't seen that recently in the EU, but we've been seeing that being installed in other country. And on the long term, we continue to believe that there will be still some nice difference between the two that is fully justified by the fact that these are better products. [Indiscernible] to say that we are ready to cover for certainly possible reduction in the gap. We think that some of that is going to happen anyway for sure, Germany being one example. And at the same time, we believe that there will be growing, I would say, consensus on the fact that there should be a clear differentiation between combustible and heat-not-burn product. Sure, Bonnie. Very clear. Maybe starting with the buyback to make it clear. No, no, we're not making any kind of guidance on what's going to be the buyback or assumption. As we said, we want to be really, super flexible. And frankly, all scenario for the magnitude of the buyback in H2 can be envisaged. But precisely because we want to keep flexibility, we don't want to put any kind of assumption on the amount of buyback for H2. That's really the way you should understand it. Now on the H2 margin versus H1, because I guess that's really your question. I think you started to summarize well the reason for the different margin evolution profile, but I'm happy to go through all the element. Certainly, what's going to be common between H1 and H2 is strong dynamism in top line with continued favorable evolution, of course, on our IQOS business. We are still facing on the CC business, also, some relatively easy comp last year, so that should have an impact on theour on of our CC business. We continue to have the nice mix impact driven by the IQOS growth on our revenue first week, so that is going to stay. And of course, that's the reason why we are raising the guidance on the revenue organic growth to 6 to 7. It's our confidence on the continuation of strong dynamism on revenue growth in H2. Then on other element that could be different, there is, as I said it answering a previous question on price, we see H2 possibly being more challenging than the 3% price increase on the CC business that we delivered in H1, so that's clearly one element. Another one is the level of productivity. You have seen the number 300 million. In H1, we target 1 billion over a 3-year period. Obviously, the 300 million is not necessarily a sustainable amount if you want for a 6 months period. So there was some front-loaded element in productivity this year. It doesn't mean that we don't intend to generate a nice productivity in H2, but not necessarily at the same level as the 300 million in H1. That's going to be another element. Then there are all the impact of the launch of ILUMA. And I see indeed on the margin to impact, One is the fact that when you launch a new product, it's true for any business, any industry. Your cost are not optimized. You don't have yet the volume to fully amortize all the investment. You haven't been optimizing all your processes. So there will be an impact on the gross margin coming from increased cost as we launch ILUMA. This is going to, of course, disappear overtime. I'm not able to tell you exactly how long it's going to take, but let's say 18 to 24 months is the typical, I would say, horizon to get to full productivity when you have some innovation. This is going to have an impact on H2. Then, we said it as well, the fact that we're going to sell more device, an ILUMA device, that is going to boost revenue, but it's not going to have the same impact as consumable on the gross margin, and, of course, with an impact on the gross margin rate. And last element that I have certainly top of mind, these 300 million to 400 million increase investments in H2 versus H1. me iAnd these investments are going to be obviously where it's going to make an impact for the Company. So it's about innovation, it's about commercial and marketing capacity, it's about digitizing further our business and the Company. That's where we're going to put that money. So you need to take all these elements into account to understand the different profile of margin evolution between H1 and H2. But having said that, obviously, we are still targeting a very nice growth of our revenue OI and adjusted EPS in H2 obviously."

            "name": "Emmanuel Babeau",
            "content": "Thank you, Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. I hope everyone listening to the call is safe and well. Our business delivered a very strong performance in the second quarter of 2021, coming slightly ahead of our expectations to match Q1's record high quarterly adjusted diluted EPS of $1.57 despite the continued challenges of the global pandemic.  Most impressive was the continued strong growth of IQOS, which made up 13% of our volumes and nearly 30% of our adjusted net revenues compared to 24% in the prior-year quarter. HTU shipment volumes grew plus 30% and plus 12% compared to the same quarter last year and the previous quarter sequentially to reach 24.4 billion units with strong growth across key geographies.  We also continued converting adult smokers at a good pace surpassing an estimated 20 million users, of which almost 15 million have switched to IQOS and stopped smoking. Combustible net revenues grew by plus 4% in Q2 on an organic basis, reflecting a partial volume rebound against a weak prior year quarter and solid pricing partly offset by market mix.  Our adjusted operating income margin expanded significantly in both the second quarter and first half overall, and while we expect commercial investments to step up in the second-half, this puts us firmly on track for a strong 2021 performance organically with an expected currency tailwind providing additional growth in dollar terms.  Importantly, this outlook also allowed us last month to confirm our share buyback program, where we target $5 billion to $7 billion over 3 years. We are also delighted to announce that IQOS ILUMA, the next-generation of IQOS, will be launched in Japan next month.  As we covered at Investor Day in February, this represents a major step in category innovation as we seek to accelerate our journey toward a smoke-free future. With regard to long-term growth, we also took important steps to build our modern oral and beyond nicotine business in recent weeks through the proposed acquisition of Fertin Pharma and Vectura, which I'll come back to later.  Turning to the headline numbers, our Q2 adjusted net revenue grew by plus 11.6% on an organic basis, or around plus 18% in dollar terms. This reflects both the recovery of the combustible business in many markets compared to the heavily disrupted second quarter of 2020, including the need for higher inventory levels and the continued strength of IQOS with plus 35% organic growth in RRP net revenue.  For combustible, while certain geographies and channels remain significantly affected by the pandemic, notably in South and Southeast Asia, South America, and global duty-free, re-openings in much of the world have led to partial recovery in social occasion and a sequential recovery in our market share.  We witnessed good organic growth of plus 5.1% in our net revenue per unit, driven by the increasing weight of IQOS in our sales mix and pricing on both combustible and RRPs. Our adjusted operating income margin increased by 270 basis points on an organic basis.  This reflects the increasing weight and profitability of IQOS, higher combustible volume, the positive impact of pricing, productivity savings including lower device costs and lower commercial spend due to the pandemic.  Our resulting adjusted diluted EPS of $1.57 represent plus 17.8% organic growth and plus 21.7% in dollar terms, a very strong performance. Looking at the first half overall, our adjusted net revenues grew by almost plus 12% in dollar terms, and by plus 7.1% organically.  This was achieved despite the tougher Q1 comparison and reflects the Q2 factors I just mentioned, and the consistent growth of IQOS where progress throughout the pandemic has been impressive, notably including the doubling of users in the EU region since the end of 2019.  We delivered strong organic growth of nearly plus 6% in our net revenue per unit, again reflecting our shifting business mix and pricing. Our H1 adjusted operating income margin increased by 440 basis points on an organic basis. While we plan to increase commercial investments in the second half, as we noted at Q1, this remains an excellent performance.  Our H1 adjusted diluted EPS grew plus 19.6% organically and plus 25.6% in dollar terms, also a very strong result. This brings me to guidance for 2021. We now expect an even stronger organic performance for the year than previously supported by improved total industry volume for combustible following the easing of pandemic restrictions.  For net revenue, we are revising our organic growth forecast to between plus 6% and plus 7%, representing the upper end of the previous range. We continue to expect organic adjusted OI margin expansion of around plus 200 basis points, and we are raising our organic adjusted diluted EPS growth range to plus 12% to plus 14%, or plus 15% to plus 17% in dollar terms.  We also continue to expect HTU shipment volumes of between 95 billion and 100 billion units. Given the strong momentum across our market, the need to maintain inventory duration and preparation for the roll out of IQOS ILUMA, which uses different consumables, we expect our full-year HTU shipment to be slightly ahead of IMS volumes.  This projected organic EPS growth, including an estimated favorable currency impact of approximately $0.18 at prevailing rates, translates into an increased adjusted diluted EPS range of $5.97 to $6.07. This guidance does not include any material impact of share repurchase or acquisitions.  We recently received Board authorization for the launch of our three-year share repurchase program where we target $5 billion to $7 billion starting in the period following our Q2 earnings release. Please note this program is not affected by the proposed acquisitions of Fertin Pharma or Vectura.  Turning now to some of the key H2 assumptions underpinning the guidance. We assume that many of our key markets will have largely emerged from COVID restrictions, supporting better industry volume.  Where significant pandemic-related challenges remain, notably Indonesia, the Philippines, and certain markets in South America, we assume no significant further deterioration from the present situation. We continue to assume no meaningful recovery in duty-free this year with Intercontinental and Asian travel still subdued.  A rebound in travel within custom areas such as the European Union has limited effect. In addition, following combustible pricing of around plus 3% in the first half, we anticipate a somewhat softer second half progression. We continue to expect the full-year volumes to be plus 2% to plus 3%.  This reflects continued pandemic-related challenges in certain market, notably in South and Southeast Asia. H2 also faces tough pricing comparison from the 2020 VAT reduction in Germany and new excise tax terms in Australia. The global semiconductor shortage continues to put constraints on device supply.  And while the overall impact remains manageable, we have adjusted our device assortment to limit the effect on consumer availability. This dynamic is included in our guidance, and we continue to monitor the situation closely.  Despite these factors, we have multiple growth drivers in our business, and we are confident in our ability to deliver continued robust, top-line progress. This revenue assumption includes higher expected device shipments and the launch of IQOS ILUMA, which will contribute to less gross margin expansion compared to the first half.  As mentioned previously, we will also step up our commercial investment in key areas, including portfolio expansion and product launches such as IQOS ILUMA and IQOS VEEV, smoke-free category understanding and awareness campaign, and a number of commercial development projects. We anticipate around $300 million to $400 million of incremental spending, compared to the first half, which will impact our H2 OI margin, but overall, still expect to deliver a very robust expansion of around plus 200 basis points for the year. For Q3, specifically, we expect EPS of $1.50 to $1.55. Lastly, we continue to expect around $11 billion in 2021 operating cash flow at prevailing exchange rates and subject to year-end working capital requirement.  Before discussing our results in more depth, I want to highlight some of the positive regulatory development in the quarter. Recognition of the harm reduction potential of smoke-free product continues to gain traction.  Example in recent weeks includes the passing of a broad, differentiated regulatory framework for RRP by the Philippines House of Representative, and the institution of differentiated excise treatment for heated tobacco product in Pakistan. In Mexico, the ban on the import and export of Electronic Nicotine Delivery System no longer applies to heated tobacco devices, which will allow us to resume imports of IQOS devices.  While we are encouraged that the German government has recognized the important principle of differentiation between combustible cigarette and smoke-free product on the basis of potential health impact, we view the announced excise tax changes on heated tobacco as misguided, providing less incentive for consumer to switch away from cigarette to less harmful alternatives.  We also note the differing views among the key political groups in the country ahead of the fall election, and we are hopeful a new government could revisit the decision. In the EU marginarily, we remain optimistic, that the revision of the tobacco excise directive will lead to greater hamornization in the scriptural approach to non-combustible product, taking into account the relevant good practices and experience gained by member states.  Turning back now to our quarterly results. Q2 total shipment volume increased by plus 6.1% and by plus 1.1% for H1. This reflects continued strong growth from HTU s of plus 30% to reach 24.4 billion unit in Q2, driven by the EU region, Japan, Russia, Ukraine, and encouraging progress from recently launched market in the Middle East. HTU shipments were around 1.4 billion units ahead of IMS volume for the second quarter, reflecting the need to maintain inventory duration in the growing business, sea freight lead times, and the first shipment of ILUMA consumable.  The plus 3.2% growth in our Q2 cigarette volume reflects the recovery of a number of key markets compared to a notably week prior-year quarter when pandemic-related disruption was at its peak. While our cigarette share improved sequentially, we continue to face some specific market share headwind in addition to market mix effect, which I'll come back to.  Due to the impressive performance of IQOS Heated Tobacco Units comprised 13.3% of of our total shipment volume in it's run as compared to 11% in the year of 2020, 8% in 2019, and 5% in 2018. We expect this proportion to grow over time as a positive momentum on IQOS continues, providing a powerful driver of revenue and margin growth.  Our sales mix is changing rapidly, putting us on track to achieve our aim of becoming a majority smoke-free Company by 2025. Smoke-free product made up nearly 30% of our adjusted net revenue in the quarter and in H1, compared to 23% in H1, 2020. IQOS devices accounted for approximately 5% of the $4.4 billion of RRP net revenues, reflecting longer replacement time and fewer second device purchase for existing user due to improving battery life, functionality and reliability, and lower device prices in certain markets as we prepare for IQOS ILUMA.  The plus 7.1% organic growth in Net1 net revenue on shipment volume growth of plus 1.1% reflect the twin engines driving our topline. First is pricing on combustible and in certain market on HTU net of the lower device pricing I just mentioned.  Second, the increasing mix of HTU s in our business at IO Net revenue per unit continues to deliver substantial growth, and as explained at Investor Day, this is an increasingly powerful driver as our transformation accelerates.  Let me now go into the driver of our first half margin expansion, starting with gross margin, which expanded by plus 340 basis points on an organic basis. This is driven by multiple levers, as explained in prior quarters, including the mixed effect on HTU and pricing across our portfolio. Our significant effort on manufacturing and supply chain efficiency are bearing fruits, more than offsetting the effect of combustible volume declines, with around $300 million of gross productivity saving delivered in H1.  This represent a strong start on the journey towards our target of $1 billion over 2021, 2023. This was accompanied by strong SG&A efficiency with our adjusted H1 marketing administration and research cost, 90 basis points lower, as a %age of adjusted net revenue on an organic basis.  This reflects the ongoing digitalization and simplification of our business processes, including our IQOS commercial engine and more efficient ways of working. We delivered around $120 million towards our 2021, 2023 target of $1 billion in growth SG&A savings before inflation and reinvestment.  Focusing now on combustible, we hold the leading international portfolio by market share and by brand strengths. This give us a formidable platform to accelerate the growth of IQOS via our commercial infrastructure, industry expertise, and ability to communicate with adult smoker where permitted.  It is therefore important to maintain our leadership through selective investment, as we also drive return through pricing and efficiency. Despite good results in markets like Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, our Q2 cigarette share remained below the prior year, with over half of the share loss due to market mix, reflecting our high exposure to market, like the Philippine and low presence in certain emerging markets with strong rebound, such as Bangladesh.  Importantly, our share improved sequentially compared to the first quarter and we expect this positive trajectory to continue through the second half. This reflects a partial recovery from the COVID impact on social occasion, where Marlboro over-indexes, border closures, and travel.  However, the expected recovery is also supported by portfolio initiative, including in the value segment and the enduring strength of Marlboro. We continue to target stabilization in our cigarette category share over time, with HTU gains coming on top.  I will know turn briefly to the South and Southeast Asia region. As covered last quarter, after a difficult 2020, notably in Indonesia, volume headwinds have been moderating. However, the pandemic remains a major issue in the region, with renewed lockdowns in a number of areas. Daily consumption patterns are still below pre-pandemic levels, and the pricing environment remains challenging.  We continue to expect volume growth in Indonesia this year as the industry improves, with encouraging recent share gain within the Tier 1 segment where we participate. Our overall share in both Indonesia and the Philippines was sequentially broadly stable in Q2, with our portfolio initiative geared at further share recovery over the balance of the year. In RRPs, IQOS continued to grow strongly in Metro Manila with an exit share of over 1% for HEETS.  For the region overall, we remain on track to deliver positive organic net revenue growth over the April to December period as outlined on our Q1 call. Moving now to IQOS performance, we estimate there were 20.1 million IQOS users as of June 30th.  After the exceptional addition of around plus 1.5 million adult user in the first quarter, we added a further plus 1 million in Q2 and plus 2.5 million year-to-date, building on the step-ups in the second half of 2020. Our accelerated pivot to digital and remote engagement during the pandemic, combined with strong momentum for the IQOS brand is paying off.  We further estimate that 73% of this total of 14.7 million adult smokers have switched to IQOS and stopped smoking, with the balance in various stages of conversion. Strong conversion rates notably reflect the increased prevalence of IQOS 3 DUO, which offers a superior user experience to previous device session. We seek to achieve even higher conversion rate overtime with the introduction of innovation such as IQOS ILUMA.  This user growth, again, reflect widespread momentum across all key IQOS geographies, including the EU region, Japan and Russia. It also reflects the enrichment of our offer and the segmentation of the category with new products and more price points, both above and below our initial HTU offering.  In the EU region, second quarter share for EHTS reached 5.5% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume plus 1.6 points higher than Q2 last year. As mentioned, last quarter we expected sequential share for HTU to be broadly in line with the first quarter due to the effect of seasonality and pandemic-related fluctuation on the combustible market.  Underlying trends remained strong, with Q2 HTU IMS volume growing plus 50% year-over-year, and around plus 11% sequentially when adjusted for estimated trade inventory movements. We expect to see similar dynamic in the third quarter, with broadly stable headline share versus robust underlying growth.  This excellent performance includes strong growth across the region, with Italy and Poland as notable contributors. We continued to grow our EU region IQOS user base, doubling since the start of 2020 despite the pandemic, to reach over 6.3 million.  Strong performance continued in Russia with 8% sequential user growth in Q2, and our HTU share by 1.3 points to reach 7.3%. As in the EU, sequential share can be distorted by the combustible market. Adjusted for estimated trade inventory movement, this reflects close to plus 30% year-over-year IMS growth. After the excellent progress and geographic expansion of IQOS in recent year, the heated tobacco category in Russia is now large and growing. This very positive dynamic naturally attract competition, and as seen before in markets like Japan, heavily discounted competitive offering can generate initial consumer trial. We continue to grow our user base, and with both our existing price tier portfolio and the future launch of IQOS ILUMA, we see ample room for further strong growth.  While we have historically focused on Russia in our earning calls, there is Negative Noise broad HTU growth across the Eastern Europe region with Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Southeast Europe significantly contributing. We show here the excellent overall original growth trend in adjusted IMS.  Note that following recent international assumption, IQOS is no longer available for sale in Belarus where we achieved a Q2 uptake share in means of almost 7%. We continue to see sequential volume growth for both our HEET and Fiit lineup in Russia and Ukraine. Moreover, this solid and fit consumable continued to supplement user acquisition.  In both Russia and Ukraine, the majority of consumer purchasing a LIL device are smokers entering the smoke-free category for the first time, with high level of conversion in line with IQOS, benefiting from our IQOS conversion infrastructure.  With this success, we also introduced LIL SOLID in 5 further market in Eastern Europe this quarter, with additional markets plan later this year. Japan, the adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by plus 2.3 points, that was the prior year quarter, and by 0.2 point sequentially to 21%, highlighting the strength of our pricier portfolio and broad range of [Indiscernible] following the October 2020 price increase. IMS volume adjusted for estimate trade inventory movements grew by around plus 5% sequentially, after accounting for fewer selling days in the first quarter. We continue to expect robust underlying progress in user growth and consumer uptake supported by the launch of IQOS ILUMA in August.  As in prior years, with an additional excise increase in October 2021, there may be volatility on the timing of IMS and consumer uptake between the third and fourth quarters. In H1, the overall heated tobacco category made-up around 29% of the adjusted total Japanese tobacco market, with IQOS maintaining a high share of segment and capturing the large majority of the categories' growth.  In addition to strong growth in existing market, the geographic expansion of our smoke-free product continues. This allows us to provide access to better alternatives to an ever increasing amount of adult smoker, as we aim to be in android market by 2025.  Our second quarter launches in Kyrgyzstan and with Uzbekistan with both IQOS and LIL offerings, take the total number of market where PMI smoke-free product are available for sale to 67, of which over half are outside the OECD. Core driver of our continued success in smoke-free product is innovation.  We are very excited to launch IQOS ILUMA, the next generation of IQOS, next month in Japan. Building on the success of IQOS 3 DUO, we believe this simple and intuitive device will support easier switching and higher conversion for legal age smoker using Smartcore internal induction heating technology. As outlined at Investor Day, ILUMA will come in multiple device formats, and have its own range of HTU consumables.  The ongoing success of IQOS review, almost 2 years after launch, demonstrates that significant innovation can have a lasting positive impact on gross. We plan for further market launches of IQOS ILUMA through the remainder of this year and in 2022.  Naturally, for a major new innovation and as seen with earlier version of IQOS, the unit cost profile of IQOS ILUMA devices and consumable begin at a higher level. but we expect this to improve over time as scale increases. This dynamic is included in our guidance assumptions.  We are continuing to commercialize IQOS VEEV with a good progress in the first group of market, where we started in our own channel with an initially limited range of test variant and nicotine level. IQOS VEEV is a premium product providing a superior experience.  And as we explained previously, the commercial infrastructure of IQOS allows us to deploy efficiently and at scale through a bespoke route-to-market approach. As we start to expand distribution and the consumable offering, we see signs of increased uptake and clear positive consumer feedback relative to competitive product.  We plan to launch in further market later this year, and we'll continue to test edge verification technology in select markets. In addition to heated tobacco and eVapor, we announced in February our intention to enter the small but fast growing nicotine pouch category this year.  To complement our internal development, we have two important acquisition to establish a base of capability in science, technology, and manufacturing, and build our platform in Modern Oral. The first of these was AG Snus completed during the second quarter.  AG Snus has a relatively small branded portfolio of Modern Oral product, which provide us a foothold in the category. In addition, the proposed acquisition of Fertin Pharma will give us access to a range of promising oral delivery technology and capability, some of which could be applied to the modern oral Nicotine space.  We will return with further news on our commercial plans in this area later this year. I also want to come back to our Beyond Nicotine strategy, which we first outlined at Investor Day. We see significant opportunities in adjacent areas with our two-focus corridors of self-care wellness, including botanical, and inner Therapeutic, expected to have an addressable market of around $65 billion by 2025.  The proposed acquisition of Fertin Pharma and Vectura can enable us to more rapidly expand our development capabilities in innovative, in health, and oral product formulation while continuing to grow their respective CDMO activities. Fertin has a range of promising oral delivery technology, including pouches, gum, and lozenges, which can be applied in both the Modern Oral Nicotine and Beyond Nicotine areas, notably for self-care wellness product.  With Vectura, we would gain access to differentiated proprietary technology and pharmaceutical development expertise to deliver a broad range of complex inhaled therapies. Vectura has highly complementary human capital, technology, high quality infrastructure, and deep know-how of inhalable formulation and device design development and analysis, drug device combination, and pharmaceutical management processes and system.  These proposed acquisitions would fully leverage PMI 's existing capability in life science, product innovation, and clinical expertise related to inhalation. Such acquisitions can also enhance our progress on important sustainability priorities. Firstly, building our capabilities in Mordern Oral is a key enabler of broadening the reach and access of our smoke-free alternative to other smoker around the world.  And secondly, building a strong Beyond Nicotine business is a major objective as we strive to develop commercially successful product with a net positive impact on society. On ESG and sustainability, more broadly, we are firm believers in the power of investor engagement to drive positive change.  Given PMI 's unique sustainability and transformation story, we have increased our own outreach. We published our second integrated report in May, which provides the comprehensive detail and transparent disclosure of how we create sustainable value and how we are progressing toward our purpose and target, including our most important commitment of all; to phase out cigarettes.  We also had a dedicated sustainability webcast on June the 2nd, where we covered the fundamental alignment of our transformation and financial performance with addressing our impact on society.  We shared the latest studies using real-world data on a possible association between accelerated cigarette volume decline and certain disease reduction in Japan. We also reaffirm our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion as an essential enabler of future success.  We continue to make progress on our 2025 roadmap with notable development in Q2 being our second certified carbon-neutral factory in Switzerland, taking us one step closer to achieving carbon neutrality by 2025, and the publication of our eco design principal, as we seek to play our part in the secular economy. In closing, after delivering 1% total volume growth and 7% organic revenue growth in H1, we have raised our 2021 organic growth expectation to plus 6% to plus 7% in net revenue, and plus 12% to plus 14% in adjusted diluted EPS.  We are on track for an excellent performance. Moreover, we continue to invest in the future. Most immediately, this means the launch of IQOS ILUMA in Japan next month and in more markets later this year. We are also investing in the broadening of our smoke-free product, Portfolio, and geographic reach.  This is critical as we seek to accelerate the number of adult smokers who switched to better alternative, with the growing positive impact on society. In addition, we are investing in the capabilities of tomorrow as illustrated by our two recent propose acquisition, which provide a comprehensive development platform across our Beyond Nicotine focused areas.  Finally, we are also committed to returning cash to shareholder through dividend and share repurchase in line with our [Indiscernible] to deliver sustainable value and return to investor as we continue to, as we continue our journey towards becoming a majority smoke-free business. Thank you very much. I am no more than happy to answer your questions. Hi, Chris. Thank you, Chris. No, I think there was an element of preparation for the launch in this Q2. For the rest of the year, at that stage, we expect IMS and shipment to be more aligned, so we don't expect to have further material differences at that stage emerging in H2. Sure, Chris. On this objective to stabilize our market share in the CC segment or CC category, that's a clear objective that we have. Of course, it's a year-on-year stabilization that we want to reach. We are stabilizing sequentially quarter-on-quarter, and it's good to see that the Q2 market share is showing this kind of improvement versus Q1.  We are not there yet in terms of stabilization year-on-year. That's an objective that we have gradually for the coming quarters. We'll see when we are able to reach it, but that's clearly something that we want to pursue. On the pricing environment, as you have seen we started nicely the year.  Q2 was still quite good. I would cite in Indonesia, we are reporting a price impact of about 5%, so clearly positive. H2 is more difficult as we've been flagging it in terms of basis of comparison. There was a VAT decrease in Germany. There is a different pattern in excise duty increase in Australia, so that is going to play.  And we are also going to monitor what is the situation as hopefully we are exiting the COVID crisis, which exactly what is the timing and how is the exit, but we know that many economies would still stay quite impacted by that. So, we'll be of course monitoring the capacity of our customers to follow price increases and that will be certainly driving our decision when it comes to price increases.  So, I would say we're going to monitor the situation. We're going to see what is happening. There would be certainly a question on evolution of inflation here and there as well that we're going to take into account. So, a lot of unknown at this stage, but we'll take that into account to monitor and decide on price increase. Nevertheless, we have been flagging the fact that after a 3% increase in H1, we do confirm the overall bracket of 2% to 3% for the full year, which means that we expect notably and partially because of tougher comps in H2, an H2 that could be less favorable in terms of price increase than H1. Thank you. Hi, Michael. Sure. So remember Indonesia was a very tough market last year, really hit hard by the pandemic. It doesn't mean, unfortunately, that the country has exited the crisis. And until recently, there has been new announcements of lockdown and restrictions. It's probably the impact was so strong last year that we're comparing to probably favorable basis of comparison, but the situation is certainly not back to normal there.  Nevertheless, what we are seeing is certainly an improvement of the situation, again, based on probably favorable comparison. We are doing well ourselves when it comes to the premium market, what we call the Tier 1 with more excise duty, and we are gaining share there, and that explains that we are able to grow our volume this year.  But we are also, unfortunately, at the same time seeing the Tier 2 category, the one enjoying lower taxes, that is still gaining ground and probably getting close to 30% market share. It used to be, at the end of last year, around 25%, 26%. So, that is playing the other way around, and hopefully this is going to be corrected with evolution [ph] on the excise duty policy put in place by the government.  But, of course, we don't have any news on that and we don't know if and when it's going to happen. That is a situation that we are facing. And in Indonesia, there is clearly improvement versus last year. It doesn't mean that the environment, when it comes to possibility of price increase, is becoming favorable, but at least it's no longer the kind of very negatively oriented market that it used to be for us last year. We are impacted by the increase in duty, so we are increasing price, but it's still having a negative impact, and that's why there is a difference between what we are reporting in terms of price impact with Indonesia and without Indonesia. So, overall it's still having a bit of a negative impact. That's correct. So, there is no official launch of an IQOS club where we may gather some user. As you know, Indonesia is first and foremost a kretek market. And while we certainly have the objective to develop a specific heat-not-burn device for kretek, we haven't been launching it yet.  So, we do that, of course, addressing only part of the population, the one with the purchasing power that can afford the current devices, and also a small group of people that are non-kretek, if you want, smoker but that's a very small fraction of the consumer. So, that could be the element that you are referring to, but there is no offficial global launch, if you want, at that stage. Thank you. Hi, Gaurav. Well, thank you for the question, Gaurav. I think you're going too far. We've been sharing this three-year guidance and objective at the time of the Investor Day, more than 9%. We are off to a strong start because we are targeting indeed for the first year 12% to 14%, it's clearly above the 9%, so I think we're compliant for the time being with the overall beyond 9%, and that means that we are certainly on good track to deliver the more than 9%, but I don't see a contradiction between the more than 9% and what you said the new good news, which is the strong start in 2021. Certainly, Gaurav, with IQOS ILUMA, we are going to enrich the premium category for [Indiscernible] product. And as we keep saying, that's going to be a real, I would say, major change for customers, and it's going to represent for them clearly a big, big progress, killing the remaining pinpoints. And therefore, of course we focus on that for the time being. We believe the potential is huge as we've been highlighting. Now, depending on how the market is evolving, certainly we'll see what is the interest of launching new devices with a different positioning. The ultimate goal, as we also said in several instances, is certainly, in any case, to have a full coverage of the spectrum of the market, from the most premium positioning to certainly more value for money designed to cost simple product that are of course delivering an experience that is not at the level of the prime experience, but that is value for money and good enough experience for other type, I would say, of customers So Japan will make no exception in our willingness to cover once again, the full market from premium to medium and even low price positioning. Thank you. Yes. Bonnie, Certainly, that's of course a very good question. I happy to elaborate on it. First and foremost, and that's probably the most important in my answer, we are really happy to see competition really taking now the bih tategueyas a big priority. And showing, I think increase commitment engagement beyond the category. We think that the shared vision on the fact that we need jointly to phase out cigarette and develop better product for smokers is a way, certainly, to accelerate the journey to end smoke the world. To see competition realizing that this is a great category, this is answering smokers need and expectation, putting more innovation, more investment there in the category, that's just great. And I think we can start seeing in some geography where competition increase investment, we can see the overall growth of the market accelerating. And of course, as we take a lion's share of that, that is very good news. Having said that, obviously, what is important for the smoker is the capacity to find with it heat-not-burn tech nology and proposal. Something that is mimicking, to the closest way possible, the experience versus combustible cigarette. And that's where our technology, our capacity to innovate, is making a big difference. And that's where probably some of the competition is struggling a little bit, and that is the reason why some of them believe that they have to discount their product to get some traction. So what does it generate? At the end of the day, it generates the fact that you may have a trial because the device is coming almost for free, the consumable is cheaper. But then if it's not satisfactory, if it doesn't provide the same pleasure, the same benefit as what you have with an IQOS experience and we love further more with IQOS ILUMA, then whether you switch back to IQOS, or you may just be back to combustible cigarette because as you're feeling that that's not satisfactory versus what you really enjoy. And therefore, it's not whether playing the role of converting smokers to heat-not-burn, and you create lot -- lower average consumption device and lower loyalty. So we continued to be a firm believer that at the end of the day, just the right technology, the right experience will convert the majority of the smokers to switch to better product and to heat-not-burn category. And we believe that this is exactly what we are offering with IQOS. And that make us confident on our capacity to retain big market share. It doesn't mean that we're not going to propose also, simpler device, always with our capacity to innovate. Targeting, as I said, different purchasing power, different expectation. But certainly we will continue to lead the way when it comes to a premium product delivering a superior experience. Thank you, Bonnie. Thank you. Hi, Pamela. Thank you, Pamela. I have to say, I fully understand your curiosity and that you want to know more about this extract in order to form an opinion. But I'm afraid I will have to disappoint you because, as you can imagine, that is super sensitive and we don't want to disclose the detail of that. Nevertheless, I'm certainly happy to say that we are putting investment in places that are going to move top-line, i.e. growing more volume, more conversion on a smoker switching to IQOS. Certainly, part of the amount is going to be behind the launch of IQOS ILUMA. But not only, there are also commercial activity. As we see, a number of markets returning to a certain normalcy. I will not say we are fully there, but certainly more reason to reaccelerate a number of marketing and commercial activity. And that's going to be important. We are also accelerating in term of innovation, and we are putting more money in life science and to build more presence in RRP category notably, so that's part of the accelaration. And we also signal it's going to be much more marginal, but that we may have to very selectively reinvest here and there on CC where it's possible. I would say it's going to be a small fraction of the extra investment, butt we have this objective of stabilizing our market share. So I think with that, Pamela, you have really what is behind the 300 million to 400 million. No, you don't need to necessarily annualize that, but let's be clear we're going to launch ILUMA in many more country next year in 2022. And And I'm not able to elaborate at that stage on what's going to be the plan in term of investment, but I would expect that, yeah, we'd certainly want to invest with a great return on this new offering and new technology. S that would have some impact on our investment next year. Remember, nevertheless, we have a very ambitious program to generate 1 billion efficiency on S G&A. We have ambition to be very dynamic on revenue. And therefore, our goal over a three-year period is to reduce nicely the SG&A on revenue ratio to create a driver for increased profitability. And of course, including all this investment that absolutely remained a big ambition that we have. Well, thank you for highlighting the great talent of Deepak and we're all very pleased to see him taking his new responsibility. I think it just highlights, certainly, the potential that we see globally for Americas but notably, of course, for the U.S. We want to keep working in close interaction with Altria on IQOS. We flagged the fact that we could have, certainly, for IQOS VEEV some ambition. You will allow me not to elaborate more on that, but that certainly mean that we see the U.S. as actually a country where reduced risk product have a great potential and we want to participate in that potential. You're welcome. Hi Vivien. Sure, Vivien. Indeed, we -- on VEEV, this is what I could call a soft launch for a number of reason. We want to learn the category. We are learning in many dimension including age verification, which we see as absolutely paramount. And the obvious initial move from us was to put VEEV as the nice complement for some of the already IQOS [Indiscernible] been user in the case of polyusage. And that was a natural move from people who were knowledgeable of IQOS already, the technology, the great experience the IQOS brand can provide. I think we are moving now to new dimension. We have beyond this initial move some great feedback coming from consumer that show that it's not only the elegance of the design, but the overall experience, the quality of the product that is comparing very well when we do test versus competitors. So time to certainly accelerate in our ambition that will come with more launches, of course, development of more flavors. So after this first step in the category, you should expect us to certainly increase ambition on vaping. My view would be, Vivien, that with the proposed acquisition of Fertin and Vectura, we would certainly really build a very strong platform on which for our 2 ambitions on inhale therapeutic and on self-care wellness, we would have indeed very strong platform, and notably from life science perspective. For the life science, that would be great. That's certainly the view that we have today on that topic. Thank you. Alright. Well, let me leave you with some key messages then. First, despite the slower recovery from pandemic in certain markets, we are happy to report a very robustful first half performance with a record high adjusted diluted EPS and raised 2021 guidance. Second, the impressive growth of IQOS continues. And we remain on track to deliver our target of 95 to 100 billion units for the year. Third, our Combustible Business is improving sequentially as the recovery from the pandemic infraction in many key markets. Lastly, we are building towards important milestone in our Beyond Nicotine strategic vision, as part of our business transformation. Thank you again for joining us and talk to you soon."

Emmanuel?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I hope everyone listening to the call is safe and well. Our business delivered a strong performance in the first quarter of 2021 well ahead of expectations, reaching a record high quarterly adjusted diluted EPS of $1.57, despite the continued challenges of the global pandemic. Most impressive was the continued strong growth of IQOS, which made up 13% of our volumes and 28% of our net revenues compared to 21.7% in the prior year quarter. We continued converting adult smokers at a very good pace and reached an estimated total of 19.1 million users, of which 14 million have switched to IQOS and stopped smoking. HTU shipment volumes grew plus 30% compared to the prior year quarter with record market shares in key IQOS geographies, 12 markets with double-digit national share and the share of 7.6% overall in IQOS markets excluding the U.S. Our operating margins were also significantly above the prior year quarter, and while somewhat flattered by timing factors, the bulk of this improvement reflect strong underlying performance. The resulting combination of strong organic net revenue and adjusted diluted EPS growth leads us to raise our outlook for the year. From a product standpoint, we continue to broaden our smoke-free portfolio and saw encouraging progress from new device and consumable offerings across multiple markets. We expect to benefit from further innovation through the course of 2021. Turning to the headline numbers. Our Q1 net revenues grew by plus 2.9% on an organic basis. This was an excellent performance in the context of an essentially pre-COVID prior year comparison and incorporates better than expected HTU, IMS and shipment volumes, which drove plus 32% organic growth in RRP net revenue. We also saw some higher-than-expected pull forward of shipments, predominantly cigarettes in the EU region, ahead of the Easter period and in Russia ahead of the April 1 discount ban. We saw strong organic growth of plus 6.9% in our net revenue per unit, driven by the increasing weight of IQOS in our sales mix and pricing on both combustible and RRPs. Combustible tobacco pricing was plus 2.7% of prior year combustible net revenues, reflecting solid pricing in many markets, partially offset by Indonesia. Excluding Indonesia, combustible pricing was over plus 4%. Our adjusted operating income margin increased by 580 basis points on an organic basis. This reflects the increasing weight and profitability of IQOS; the positive impact of pricing; productivity savings, including lower device cost; lower commercial spend due to the pandemic; the favorable comparison in Eastern Europe and certain other timing factors. Combined with a lower effective tax rate, our resulting adjusted diluted EPS of $1.57 represent plus 21.5% organic growth, a very strong performance. We estimate the timing factors in the quarter, such as the earlier shipment mentioned and cost phasing had a positive impact of around plus $0.08. Although one-time factors accounted for an estimated further plus $0.02 increase. This brings me now to guidance for 2021. While the speed and shape of the global recovery from the pandemic remains uncertain, the strong business results and underlying momentum of the first quarter, notably from our IQOS business, lead us to raise our outlook. We continue to account for a range of outcomes in our outlook for organic growth in net revenue and EPS. This range, assume that even in the event of renewed or prolonged restriction, we will not see a return to the depressed consumption level of Q2 2020. While we have not been affected thus far by the current global shortage of semiconductor, the guidance assumes a limited impact on the supply of electronic devices to consumer. This is a fluid situation which we are monitoring closely and where any constraint may arise, we intend to manage our inventories accordingly and prioritize device sales to other smokers who are new to the category. Regarding duty-free, a rebound in global travel is likely to lag the improvement of in-country mobility. Our guidance continue to assume no meaningful recovery in duty-free this year. We now expect organic net revenue growth in the range of plus 5% to plus 7% versus plus 4% to plus 7% communicated previously and organic adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 11% to plus 13% or plus 15% to plus 17% in reported terms. The strength of IQOS is the main driver for this revision. We now expect to deliver HTU shipment volume of between 95 billion and 100 billion units, representing the upper half of our previously targeted range for 2021. Given the continued strong momentum across our market, the need to maintain inventory duration and preparation for the rollout of IQOS ILUMA that uses different consumable, we expect our full-year shipment to be slightly ahead of our IMS volumes. We also raised our assumption for organic adjusted OI margin expansion to around plus 200 basis points. This includes the expectation of greater investment in the second-half as our innovation and commercial activities step up. As detailed in this morning's press release, our other main assumptions remain unchanged. This projected organic EPS growth, including an estimated favorable currency impact of approximately plus $0.20 at prevailing rates versus plus $0.25 assume previously, translate into a raised adjusted diluted EPS range of $5.95 to $6 or $5. This guidance does not include any impact of share repurchases. However, we remain on track to resume repurchases in the second-half of the year subject to Board approval. Looking forward to the second quarter, we now expect adjusted diluted EPS of $1.50 to $1.55, reflecting strong topline growth against a weak prior year comparison, continued margin improvement and a partial reversal of certain Q1 timing benefit. For the second-half, assuming that many of our key market will have largely emerged from COVID restriction, we expect continued robust top line growth. This include the contribution of higher expected device shipments, which will result in less gross margin expansion, compared to the first-half. New product launches, investments in distribution and the phasing of productivities will also play a role. We will also step up our commercial investment in the future growth of RRP through portfolio and geographic expansion, including product launches such as IQOS ILUMA. We anticipate around plus $300 million to plus $400 million of incremental commercial investment compared to the first-half and consequently expect our organic OI margin expansion to be lower in H2, but overall, to deliver a strong expansion of around plus 200 basis point for the year. Before discussing our results in more depth, I want to highlight a few of the positive regulatory developments in the quarter. Recognition of the harm reduction potential of smoke-free product continues to gain traction. Example, so far this year includes the reversal of a long-standing import ban on heated tobacco product in Uruguay and the integration of the harm reduction principle in Lithuania's tobacco control agenda. We also note the recent report from an all-party parliamentary group of MPs in the UK, calling for the WHO to return to the founding principle of the FCTC, which includes harms reduction rather than the current prohibitionist stance. In New Zealand, we are reviewing the content and detail of the consultation paper published last week. The policy recognizes the role of innovative product in harm reduction, while at the same time, ensuring strict control to prevent youth access. In the EU, we continue to be hopeful that the revision of the tobacco excise directive will lead to greater amortization in the effort to smoke-free product, taking into account the relevant good practices and experience gained by member states in this area. Here and around the world, we continue to support differentiated regulatory and fiscal framework based on the relative risk to health. While there will on occasion be actions or proposals that do not incorporate harm reduction objectives, we believe that facts and science will guide policy over time and we continue to see positive changes in many geographies. Well, turning back now to our results, Q1 shipment volumes declined by 3.7% on the total PMI business. This reflects continued strong growth from HTUs of plus 30% to reach 21.7 billion units, driven by the EU region, Japan, Russia, Ukraine and an encouraging start from recently launched market in the Middle East. HTU shipment and IMS volumes were broadly in line for the quarter. While pandemic-related restriction persisted around the world, total industry volume declines of 0.7% were relatively benign incorporating over plus 25% growth in the heated tobacco category where we continue to have a share of over 80%. Though less severe than in Q4 2020, our cigarette volume declines reflect specific share headwind in certain markets, which I'll come back to. We expect better combustible share and volume trends in both the second quarter and second-half of the year. The strong performance from IQOS led to heated tobacco units, comprising 13% of our total shipment volume in Q1 as compared to 9.6% in the prior year quarter, 11% in the year of 2020, 8% in 2019 and 5% in 2018. We continue to expect this proportion to grow over time as a positive momentum on IQOS continues, providing a powerful driver of revenue and margin growth. Our sales mix is changing rapidly, putting us on track to achieve our aim of becoming a majority smoke-free company by 2025. Smoke-free products made up 28% of our total net revenue in the quarter compared to 21.7% in Q1 2020. IQOS devices accounted for approximately 6% of the $2.1 billion of RRP net revenue, reflecting longer replacement time for existing users due to improving battery lives and reliability, and lower device price in certain markets as we are preparing for IQOS ILUMA. The plus 2.9% organic growth in Q1 net revenue on shipment volume decline of 3.7% reflect the twin engine driving our topline. First is pricing on combustible and in certain market on HTU net of the lower device pricing I just mentioned. Second, the increasing mix of HTUs in our business at higher net revenue per unit continue to deliver substantial growth. And as explained at Investor Day, this is an increasingly powerful driver as our transformation accelerates. Let me now go into the driver of our first quarter margin expansion, starting with gross margin, which expanded by 390 basis points on an organic basis. This is driven by multiple levers as shown in green on this slide, including the mix effect of HTU within IQOS impact, in particular, our significant efforts on manufacturing and supply chain efficiency are bearing fruit, more than offsetting the effect of combustible volume declines, with around $150 million of gross productivity savings delivered in Q1. While somewhat front-loaded in the context of 2021, this represents a strong start on the journey towards our target of $1 billion over 2021-2023. As part of these savings, our gross profit increase was boosted by better absorption of manufacturing costs given a high level of production in the quarter and lower device costs with combined impact of around plus $60 million. Gross margin expansion was also accompanied by strong SG&A efficiencies with our adjusted marketing administration and research costs 200 basis points lower as a percentage of net revenue on an organic basis. This reflects the ongoing digitalization and simplification of our business processes, including our IQOS commercial engine and more efficient ways of working. We delivered around $60 million towards our '21-'23 target of $1 billion in gross SG&A savings before inflation and reinvestments. The pandemic also impacted SG&A costs in the quarter through the later timing of certain projects and reduced commercial and overhead costs due to ongoing restrictions. These latter factors accounted for around $100 million of the organic improvement. Focusing now on combustible, we continue to hold the leading international portfolio by market share and by brand strengths as covered at Investor Day. This gives us a formidable platform to accelerate the growth of IQOS via our commercial infrastructure, industry expertise and ability to communicate with other smokers where permitted. It is therefore imperative to maintain our leadership through selective investment as we also drive returns through pricing and efficiency. Our cigarette share underperformance in Q1 can be attributed to the combination of several factors. This includes the COVID impact on social occasion, where Marlboro overindexes; border closures and reduced travel; and instances of downtrading and competition in the mid and low-price segments in certain markets such as the Philippines and part of the EU region. This performance does not reflect our objective to maintain our share of cigarettes, net of cannibalization. We expect a strong sequential cigarette share recovery through the remainder of the year supported by portfolio initiatives and the enduring strength of Marlboro especially as pandemic restrictions ease. Accordingly, we target cigarette share to be about stable on the year-over-year basis for the next nine months, despite the impact of cannibalization. Share gains from HTUs will come on top of this. I will now turn to the South and Southeast Asia Region. After a difficult 2020, notably in Indonesia, headwinds are now moderating. In Indonesia, volume trends are improving with double-digit growth in hand-rolled kreteks, where we are the market leader supporting stable PMI share in the Tier 1 segment. Indeed, with industry volume recovering, we are targeting volume growth for our business here in 2021. Pricing remain the main headwind in Indonesia. New excise duty rates came into force on February 1, and while all major players have taken some pricing, progress nonetheless remains slow. Despite the negative consequences for government revenues, there has not yet been a significant move to level the playing field between the Tier 1 and below Tier 1 segment, which continues to grow. We remain hopeful that the government will address this issue over time. The Philippines has performed well in recent years. For this quarter, further industry pricing in H2 2020, a slow economic recovery and pandemic-linked restriction gave rise to a double-digit market decline. Our share loss reflects downtrading from the mid to low-price segment, with premium-priced Marlboro which make up over two-third of our volume growing share. Notwithstanding these challenges, we have plans to address the share decline and are targeting close to stable organic net revenue in 2021 despite the total market weakness. I'm also pleased to say that IQOS is off to an encouraging start in Metro Manila, with an exit share of almost 1% for HEETS after full launch in Q3 2020. Overall, this region delivered strong growth pre-COVID. While it may not be a meaningful growth driver in 2021, we expect far less of a drag on group result compared to 2020. We target regional organic net revenue to be at least stable over the next nine months. Moving now to IQOS performance, we estimate there were 19.1 million IQOS users as of March 31. This represents the addition of around 1.5 million adult users since December building on the step-up in the second-half of 2020. Our accelerated pivot to digital and remote engagement during the pandemic, combined with strong momentum for the IQOS brand is paying off. We further estimate that 73% of this total of 14 million adult smokers have switched to IQOS and stopped smoking, with the balance in various stages of conversion. Strong conversion rates notably reflect the increased prevalence of IQOS 3 DUO, which offers a superior user experience to previous device versions. As we mentioned at Investor Day, we seek to achieve even higher conversion rate over time with introduction of innovation, such as IQOS ILUMA. This user growth again reflects widespread momentum across all key IQOS geographies, including the EU region, Japan and Russia. It also reflects the enrichment of our offer and the segmentation of the category with new product and more price points, both above and below our initial HTU offering. In the EU region, first quarter share for HEETS reached a record 5.7% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume. Adjusted for estimated trade inventory movements, this reflects 46% year-over-year. IMS growth and around 10% sequential IMS growth accounting for fewer selling days in the period. I would also remind you of the sequential quarterly share dynamic, which can be distorted by the seasonality of the combustible market in addition to pandemic-related situations such as border closure and other social restrictions. With the region likely to reopen somewhat in Q2 and increase the total market, we expect further strong underlying HTU growth, but for share to be broadly in line with Q1. This excellent performance includes strong growth in Italy, surpassing 10% share, with the large majority of user acquisition coming organically as the increasing awareness and prominence of the product build its own momentum. Germany and Poland were also strong contributors. We added a further 700,000 EU region IQOS users in the quarter to reach 5.9 million, a continuation of recent strong performance. We continue to see phenomenal progress in key cities across the EU region, with a number of examples on this slide. HTU share in Rome is now approaching 20%. Warsaw and Lisbon reached 15%, Munich 8%, and London 5%. While a smaller city, the progress in Vilnius at 36% share is also a global standout. As covered at Investor Day, key cities are a good indicator of national share growth potential and I would also refer you to the appendix where we show shares for key EU market and global key cities. Strong performance continued in Russia, with our HTU share up by 1.2 points to reach a record 7.7%. Adjusted for estimated trade inventory movements, this reflect plus 35% year-over-year IMS growth and around plus 8%-10% sequentially once estimated consumer pantry loading effects are factored in. We continue to see sequential share growth for both our HEETS and Fiit lineup with good traction for the regular HEETS and super-premium HEETS creation variants. Moreover LIL SOLID and Fiit consumable continue to supplement user acquisition. In both Russia and Ukraine, the majority of consumer purchasing a LIL device are smokers entering the smoke-free category for the first time, with high level of conversion in line with IQOS. This bodes well for our ability to reach adult smoker in the medium and below price segments for whom purchasing power may be a barrier. Margins on midstream-priced HTUs such as Fiit remain attractive compared to cigarettes sold at the same price, and while the volume of Fiit remains small compared to our total HTU volume in this market given our large IQOS user base, we expect LIL to grow further in 2021. With this success in Russia and Ukraine, we plan to offer LIL SOLID in additional markets later this year. In Japan, on a total tobacco basis, including cigarillos and adjusted for trade inventory movements, the share for our HTU brands increased by 3 points versus the prior year quarter and by 0.7 points sequentially to 20.8%. Both HEETS and Marlboro HeatSticks grew market share following the October price increase, highlighting the strength of our price-tiered portfolio. We expect to see further HTU volume growth in Japan over the remainder of the year underpinned by ongoing user acquisition. For the second quarter in particular we expect robust sequential IMS growth. We also expect a recovery in the total tobacco market as the elasticity effect of the substantial October price increase fade, including on consumer pantry-loading. As such, while year-over-year share growth is still likely to be strong, Q2 share may not reflect this underlying sequential growth performance and may be broadly stable versus Q1 on an adjusted basis including cigarillos. In Q1, the overall heated tobacco category made up over 28% of the adjusted total Japanese tobacco market with IQOS maintaining a high share of segment. IQOS HTUs also reached an offtake share of 26.1% in Tokyo, after surpassing the 25% milestone in December. In addition to strong growth in existing markets, the geographic expansion of our smoke-free product continues. This allows us to provide access to better alternatives to an even increasing amount of adult smoker and as communicated at Investor Day, we aim to be in 100 markets by 2025. After launching in 12 new markets with IQOS in 2020, we added Aruba in the first quarter and launched our new e-vapor product IQOS VEEV in Finland, which takes the total number of markets where PMI smoke-free products are available for sale to 66, of which over half are outside the OECD. We are continuing to commercialize IQOS VEEV with Q1 launches in Italy, and as I just mentioned, Finland. This follows the initial launch market New Zealand and the Czech Republic in H2 2020. One of our key priorities is guarding against youth access for all our products and we are targeting for all our electronic smoke-free devices to be equipped with age verification technology by 2023. We will be testing this technology with IQOS VEEV in select markets this year. IQOS VEEV is a premium product, providing a superior experience and as we explained previously, the commercial infrastructure of IQOS allows us to deploy efficiently and at scale through a bespoke route-to-market approach. Our other market -- major innovation for 2021 is the launch of IQOS ILUMA, the next generation of IQOS, as announced at Investor Day. Building on the success of IQOS 3 DUO, we believe this simple and intuitive device will support easier switching and higher condition for legal-age smokers using Smartcore internal induction heating technology. We continue to plan for the launch of ILUMA in the second-half of the year. As we roll out both IQOS VEEV and IQOS ILUMA, we carefully plan our manufacturing and supply chain activities to manage expected demand, and external factors such as the current tightness of global semiconductor supply that I mentioned previously. The ongoing success of IQOS 3 DUO more than two years after launch demonstrates that significant innovation can have a lasting positive impact on growth, and both our recently announced 2023 HTU shipment volume target, and the upward revision of our HTU target for this year reflect this confidence. Our transformation is the bedrock for both business and sustainability performance. We do not have separate strategies, phasing out cigarettes by replacing them with better alternatives such as IQOS drives our growth and addresses our biggest impact on society. Our unique commitment to phasing out cigarettes is underlined by the new transformation targets announced at Investor Day, which are aligned with the 27 Business Transformation Metrics provided for stakeholders to measure and verify the pace and scale of our progress. This includes our ambition to become a majority smoke-free company by 2025, our aim to commercialize smoke-free products in 100 markets, and to generate at least $1 billion in net revenue from beyond nicotine products as we move into adjacent business areas with a net positive impact on society. Our best-in-class performance on ESG allows us to further our leadership in sustainability. I am proud to see increasing external recognition for example on our efforts to develop a fully sustainable supply chain and our commitment to address gender inequality. Further, we recently of data that was zero deforestation manifesto, strengthening our ambition undertaking to conserving forests across our entire value chain. We remain strongly committed to providing the highest level of disclosure on the key ESG and product impact areas of our company via integrated reporting and we released our 2020 disclosure on May 18. We recognize that EFG analysis can provide valuable insights about factors with a significant potential impact on financial performance and thus better inform investment decision. To further maximize the value of investor engagement and aid understanding of the significant positive impact PMI's transformation can have on society, we plan to hold a sustainability webcast in early June, building on our recent Investor Day. Please do mark your calendars. To conclude, we've had a strong start to the year and look forward with confidence despite the continued uncertainty on the operating environment due to COVID. This is the same concluding slide I presented at Investor Day in February, as I believe our start to 2021 demonstrates all of the key elements of our longer-term trajectory. Through IQOS we are building a business with multiple levers to deliver superior and sustainable growth over the coming year through improved volume dynamic, excellent topline growth, strong margin expansion and fast-growing earnings. Moreover, while every adult smoker who switches to IQOS is good for our business, it is also a clear positive for our impact on society and public health. We manage our transformation with care and responsibility for our stakeholders, guided by our sustainability materiality framework to maximize our positive impact across our Tier 1 ESG and product areas. This is essential for the sustainability of our business, and for delivering superior returns for shareholders over the long term. The increase in our organic growth outlook for 2021 is another step on this journey, also putting us nicely on track to achieve our 2023 financial and HTU shipment targets. Thank you. I am now more than happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Vivien Azer of Cowen.\nVivien Azer: Good morning.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Good morning, Vivien.\nVivien Azer: So given some of the headlines coming out of the U.S. yesterday, it might be helpful, please, for my first question, if you could just level-set on IQOS' designation in your international markets in terms of the type of tobacco product from the tax perspective? Thanks.\nEmmanuel Babeau: So, I guess, Vivien, if I understand, well, your question is, how is our heat-not-burn offer and product classified versus combustible cigarette in our non-U.S. geographies. Correct?\nVivien Azer: That's correct. Yes, please.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Right. So I'm not sure that I'm going to be able to give one general answer because the classification can be different from one country to the other. I would say, today, probably the fact that the excise duty applied to our IQOS product is differentiated in the vast majority of the markets show that the treatment is differentiated, so the product is addressed already in a distinct manner on that particular element recognizing that it's a different product with a different feature than the combustible cigarettes. So we are, of course, going to see some situation that can be different from one market to the other. We are certainly welcoming a regulation that will further clarify the fact that these heat-not-burn products are clearly different and a better alternative to combustible in the future. And as I think I mentioned, we see the regulation progressing nicely country after country to take that into account, have been taking a few example during my previous speech and we expect that to continue. So, we expect more and more government regulated to further clarify distinction between heat-not-burn and other reduced risk products and combustible cigarettes and come as well with different regulation. And as you know, we are calling for a differentiated approach on two items. Certainly, on the way, we can communicate on these better alternatives and better product than the combustible cigarette. And also, of course, on taxation to make sure that we have an incentive to push the smokers to this better alternative for their health.\nVivien Azer: Certainly. That's helpful. Thank you very much. And then my follow-up, if you could just provide your assessment of the risk of other countries potentially implementing a nicotine cap on combustible cigarettes. Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Well, I think that is something that as you rightly say, Vivien, is not implemented anywhere today. And I think it's an idea that certainly would have to be investigated in all its dimension. I think that could have a number of impact in term of illicit trade, in term of people smoking, actually more combustible product to get to the same kind of nicotine dose and of course, therefore with negative impact. So I think at that stage, frankly, it's too early to say whether this is something that could have the right intent. In any case, that would have to be coupled with very strong awareness, availability of better alternative and certainly, starting with heat-not-burn if we were to work, and that should be perceived as an incentive for people to quit smoking or to switch to this better alternative and certainly, heat-not-burn being the first one that could be perceived as a nice and satisfying alternative for smokers wanting to go for better product. So, I think that the idea is -- and it's not new, because I think the FDA had put the idea on the table already in 2017. I don't think that much work has been done so far on all the potential consequences. We believe that a lot of work would have to be done on the impact and the loss of scientific evidence would have to be gathered and studied on that. And in any case, for us, that would have to be coupled with a very strong awareness, availability and present that as an alternative for people who don't want to quit, but want to keep consuming nicotine.\nVivien Azer: Understood. Thank you very much.\nEmmanuel Babeau: You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Owen Bennett of Jefferies.\nOwen Bennett: Good morning, Emmanuel. Hope you are well?\nEmmanuel Babeau: How are you?\nOwen Bennett: Yes, good. Thank you. And I just wanted to focus on the incremental commercial spend in the second-half. Could you maybe give some more specifics around what this will be behind? Will it largely be focused on the rollout of VEEV and ILUMA? And then linked to this, I was just wondering how many markets realistically are you targeting for VEEV and ILUMA to be in by the back end of the year? Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes. Sure, Owen. So on the commercial spending, of course, here it's expecting, we believe realistically, that in many markets, the situation on COVID will gradually improve. So everybody believe that in many markets with the vaccination and positive evolution starting in the summer, we're going to see a switch to a gradual improvement. So, as you know, during a significant period of time, because of COVID, we've been somewhat limited restricted in commercial action, I would say, across the portfolio, but of course, starting on our IQOS business. So as we see the market opening up, it will, in a general manner, be time to be back on communication, on making our IQOS product known, build awareness, again, around IQOS is absolutely key in building our IQOS business and obviously, that will trigger more commercial and marketing activity. On top of that, you're absolutely right, that will be a period of very important launch with ILUMA and VEEV. Although VEEV has been started to be launched, we expect a number of markets in the second part of the year. We see exactly what is the final number. We want to make sure that we do that well with the right focus. On ILUMA, you can expect key market to be first on the priority list for launch. So I'm not going to disclose at that stage the names, but you shouldn't expect key market for us on IQOS to be coming very first on the list. And of course, that will require specific investment to make sure that smokers or other already RRP user understand what is the benefit of ILUMA, why it is an even greater product than the IQOS 3 DUO and generating more conversion, more loyalty to our product, so that we require nice investment in the second part of the year. So that is really what is behind this $300 million to $400 million that we are mentioning here.\nOwen Bennett: Thanks very much. Very helpful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: Hi. I wanted to ask maybe...\nEmmanuel Babeau: Hi, Bonnie.\nBonnie Herzog: \u2026a follow-up \u2013 hi, a follow-up on ILUMA. Just trying to understand as you roll this out, what's the expectation of how incremental this can be? I mean, I guess I'm wondering from your expectations internally, are you expecting to see a lot of current or dedicated IQOS users upgrade to this device? Are you expecting for a lot of new users coming into IQOS? And then since you're introducing this broad range of consumables with ILUMA, how -- should we assume that there is some level of incremental costs view related to that and therefore a margin drag or not necessarily just trying to think about how accretive this could be for you?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes, sure, Bonnie, happy to answer on these two points. So on the impact of ILUMA, we broadly expect ILUMA to be positive. Well, first of all, of course, on acquiring new smokers, and converting new smokers, because you're going to find more intuitive, easier to use products and we make on convince with ILUMA smokers that we did not manage to convince so far. So that's the first element. Second, of course, we're going to also have a number of IQOS user or other heat-not-burn tobacco product user switching to ILUMA because it's really a severe product with a lot of benefit for the consumer. And lastly, because we believe that in term of loyalty and people fully adopting the heat-not-burn practices and not moving back to cigarettes, the fact that it's a better product is also going to play a very nice role. So we expect to have people abandoning and switching back to cigarette to be nicely lower once again because it's much easier to use, it's an overall better experience and we think it's going to be really having a nice impact on that one. So as you can see, we expect several drivers behind this ILUMA innovation to further boost our performance on the IQOS globally. Regarding consumable and globally as a launch, I would say you should expect like always when you launch a new product, you are coming with a product [ph], not fully optimized in term of manufacturing productivity. It's a new product; at the beginning, the volume are low; you've made some investment; it takes some time to be fully optimized. So there will be beyond the cost of launching the product for marketing and commercial reason. There will be some impact at the gross margin level at the beginning because it's a new product and there will be a ramp up on the profitability of this new product and on the consumable margin on this new product. And that is of course taken into account in our guidance.\nBonnie Herzog: Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you. And then, I wanted to circle back to some of the news that came out yesterday regarding a potential cap on nicotine levels on cigarettes in the US. So I guess my question is wondering if there is anything you can do to accelerate the rollout of IQOS in the US, since I imagine if a nicotine cap would ever be implemented, as I see it, IQOS would have a distinct advantage. So I'd love it if you could touch on that. And then, maybe your latest thoughts on potentially entering the US market with VEEV. Wondering if that might now become more of a possibility. And if so, will you or have you submitted a PMTA? Thanks.\nEmmanuel Babeau: So just on the second one, on VEEV, It is certainly our intention at a certain point in time to submit PMTA. We have not done it yet, and I don't have the timeline yet when we do that, but yes, it is certainly our intention to do that at a certain point in time. Now on growing the IQOS business, of course, we will work with our partner, Altria there. Remember, we are not commercializing IQOS in the US. We have licensed the IQOS commercialization to Altria. Let's not overreact to what is even [ph] not the news, I think it's a press article yesterday and therefore we should not run too fast to a conclusion or believe that the world is going to change overnight. I think it's just a press article. But now, we are convinced that the FDA has one clear objective, which is to promote a policy for harm reduction that will go through innovation and based on scientific evidence and they want to supervise that, the MRTP that we received on IQOS 2.4 signal [ph] that they see IQOS as a positive contribution and according to their own world, that it's appropriate to promote public health. So that means that we have with IQOS a role to play that we believe that this vision of the FDA is something that we can accompany and that we can foster and help to develop with our innovation and with IQOS, and of course, we'll make sure that with Altria, we try to maximize what we can do there\nBonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you, again.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Spielman of Citi.\nAdam Spielman: Hi, good afternoon. I have two questions. First one is on IQOS market share. Now in the first couple of years, you've seen very good growth in 4Q versus 3Q and 1Q versus 4Q. And then market share has storms, and you can see that for example in Slide 19 and Slide 21, that sort of 2Q and 3Q, there's been no growth in Japan or a little growth and in the EU and in Russia. And I guess the question is should we expect the same sort of pattern in 2021? In other words, great growth in 4Q, you just have [ph] a great growth in Q1. But then the market share will be pretty stable for the next couple of quarters in your key markets.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Hi, Adam. Well, I think certainly the element, but I'm sure you have that in mind that you need to take into account is, first of all, that there is an underlying seasonality in many markets that is impacting the volume on CC and therefore the denominator being impacted that is even if IQOS continue to grow and globally heat-not-burn continue to grow very nicely that is impacting the overall market share. And in addition to that, the COVID impact on border closure impacts, impact on illicit and some market that was not tracked that emerge and that was mainly CC business, of course, there again, changing the denominator has been impacting the market share. So it's going to be a mix we believe in 2021 still with impact from the COVID of this normal seasonality plus the specific impact linked to the COVID. Now, we target a progressive growth overall, but it's true that on certain markets, we may have after a very strong acceleration in one quarter, for all this reason, the following quarter that could be with the lower growth and even stable -- of course year-on-year, it's still very strong growth. But you appreciate that. It's sequentially that the market share is potentially not growing at the same pace. It doesn't mean of course that the volume even sequentially are not growing either [ph] you can have volume growing as well with the market share stable. So I think market share has to be taken with a pinch of salt and should be appreciated over a longer period of time to be meaningful in what they say [ph].\nAdam Spielman: Thank you. That's very helpful. And my second question is around your quarterly EPS guidance. And really the question is whether you're worried that people are beginning to disregard it and sort of consensus is just sort of, well, [ph] not consensus, but the way the market thinks about you is no longer under your control. Now, let me try to explain that question a bit more. In the past two or three years, every time you've given guidance on a quarter [indiscernible] massively. Are you currently no longer take Massimo's [ph] office or at least if you give a guidance for certain out [ph] of EPS, I think it's probably going to come in 10% or 12% more, but it started again this quarter and yet the shares are fundamentally flat. Now, there might be other reasons for that, but it looks to me as if the market is sort of disregarding your EPS guidance on the quarter. And to me, that seems quite a dangerous situation for you. As I was wondering if you think that's right, if you're worried about it, why you didn't actually -- you're going to bet [ph] for new ships more at the end of the quarter and you didn't tell the market, and how you think this dynamic is going to play out going forward?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes, Adam. So taking your challenge on guidance and what we deliver, I would identify two sources for -- and two reasons, two [ph] driver for beating often the guidance. The first one and I think it's a good one, is the fact that we are often surprised by the strength of the IQOS business. So we expect something and it's coming even stronger, which is a case in this Q1 for some of the beat. So we are trying to make a fair assessment of what we can expect, and then when things are coming better, we take that as a good news, but it's true, we've been too cautious in the way we've been forecasting. The other one, which I hope everybody understand, is that in today's environment, it's more difficult to anticipate, predict things because you have a lot of volatility, and we've been -- it's true, surprised by things that we did not necessarily anticipated well and that can be a spending that we thought we would do even in March and that we eventually did not do, and in term of investment and we are going to do that later in the year or some movement in market that were not well anticipated. Again, with the COVID impact creating a lot of nervousness, volatility, and frankly, somewhat a roller coaster in some of the attitude of the trade and then -- and even pantry-loading from customers. So that would be really the true driver explaining why we've been beating on the few occasion, our guidance. And when we know early in the quarter that we're going to beat, I mean we share with that when it really happened at the end of the quarter, I think we believe that it's -- it becomes clear at the stage where we say we're going to -- we see that very close to the communication if [ph] you want. Now, on your challenge of -- or your question of, does it mean that the market is no longer following you. Well, I don't think this is a case. I think everybody understand the specificity of this COVID situation and accept that there can be volatility and things that we don't anticipated -- anticipate well. And then you know on the strength of IQOS, I think everybody can have a view on what we can deliver. I think we are today revising towards [ph] the guidance on the number of HeatSticks for the year to 95 billion to 100 billion. I think based on the Q1 that's really sharing with all investors, shareholder analysts, the best possible assumption that we can make and really reflecting our vision at that stage.\nAdam Spielman: Okay, thank you. It was a tough question. Thanks.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of Piper Sandler.\nMichael Lavery: Good morning. Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Hi, Michael.\nMichael Lavery: I just wanted to come back to your comment about pricing on HeatSticks and how you've begun to differentiate a little bit more there. And I assume if I heard you right, you said you're now doing both above and below the original price points you'd had. Obviously, in Japan, we saw what's the HEETS launch lower price point introduced, but could you give a little more color on how you're doing above where you have been price point? And is there additional new brands you have or a second or a third one? And just how that's positioned and if it's not too, too early what you're seeing so far with that?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Sure, Mike. Happy to do that. What is happening on our IQOS business and on the consumable is typically what you would expect in a market -- consumer good market where things start to mature a little bit. And I'm using this word with a lot of cautiousness of course because it's a very young market still, but in a few markets like Japan, for instance, a few other markets where we are not double-digit market share, it's maturing a little bit. So typically, the consumer -- the customer will expect based on his purchasing power, based on his personal lifestyle and what he wants to enjoy or what he wants to say about his life or her life around him. We'll want to have different I would say positioning on what he is consuming. So when you go for innovation, what we did with the HEETS consumable, you have one single reference at the beginning. And then rapidly, you see the need for segmenting the market, there is a category of the consumer that will be very keen to have an even severe experience. So to get to an even better consumable and ready to pay more for that, so to have higher expenses that's what we have with whether the Marlboro HeatSticks in Japan or HEETS creation in Russia, you keep the premium below the hyper [ph] premium if you want. And then, at a certain point in time, there is also a need for a medium and probably later in the future for a medium minimum positioning because other consumers will be keen to have an inferior overall experience but still great rewarding versus what they used to have with the same category of combustible and of course, at a lower price point. So I think we're just doing the right commercial marketing job to make sure that we give satisfaction to all the expectation of our customers. It happens gradually, it's relevant yet in every country. But as more and more country are becoming a bit mature, that will become increasingly relevant in more and more market in the future.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. That's a really helpful color. And on your sort of quote mature Japan market where you grew three or four share points year-over-year, I just want to make sure I understand some of the dynamics there. You gave the adjusted share which of course excludes some trade moves but also cigarillos and then the other share. The gap between those has widened a little bit over the five quarters you show, it's like 1.3, 1.5, 1.6, 1.9, and then 2.6. Unfortunately, we don't have great visibility on cigarillos. Is it just growth in that segment, that's the key driver there or is there also a little bit of an inventory build we should have in mind as we think about modeling 2Q and beyond?\nEmmanuel Babeau: No, Michael, there is no concern of inventory bill whatsoever, that certainly the level of cigarillo, remember that is a specific category. The tax advantage will fully disappear next October but there is still, until now, a very dynamic category in Japan. So what we are, as I said, seeing in Japan has been following the October excise duty increase and price increase. A very, very nice reaction from our IQOS business altogether both Marlboro HeatSticks and HEETS, we've been gaining very nice market share at the end of the year 2020 in Q4. It continued in Q1 and therefore we are disclosing very positive and genuine market share growth during the last two quarters and we are very happy with it.\nMichael Lavery: Okay, great. Thanks so much.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.\nChris Growe: Hi, good morning.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Hi, Chris.\nChris Growe: Questions were asked. I have just two quick ones for you. I was just curious in relation to IQOS, you've had really strong development of market share in Russia and the EU. Those were also markets where you continue to build your availability of the product. Do you have a rough approximation of how widely available IQOS is, say in the EU and Russia? Is there still more distribution potential in those markets to get it in front of more consumers?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Well, clearly, we said it in Russia, we have not a full coverage of the country yet. In the EU, we have a number of countries where we are in the big cities, but not yet with an important full coverage, I would say with a lot of capillarity I think Yatsik [ph], at the time of the Investor Day, highlighted the market share that we have in key cities and signal that if we look backwards, the market share a few years upstream are good -- in big cities are a good indication of where you can get the whole market, a few years down the road. So, I think that's a pretty good indicator of the fact that we manage, of course, to get an even higher market share in key cities and the overall country and the fact that we have done that in key cities mean that we are very likely if we continue to do a good job to reach the same kind of market share globally for the country. But of course, it's not the end of the road because at the same time, we kept increasing share in the big cities, so it's an ongoing improvement if you want. But that's I think the way you should be looking at things.\nChris Growe: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And just one other question in relation to combustibles in an area where you've had a little bit of share pressure again this quarter, and there's some reasons for that. But I just was curious when I think about commercial investments in the second-half of the year, I was thinking that in relation to IQOS and reduced risk products, do you need to apply more money, more attention, whatever the right word is towards combustible cigarettes to try to shore up some of that market share decline? I know some of this is being generated by the success of IQOS but just curious how you're looking at that and is there any kind of change in the competitive dynamic you're seeing in combustibles.\nEmmanuel Babeau: I mean we are certainly seeing competition quite active on combustible because for many of them, they have only little presence in RRP. So they are trying to protect and build their business there and especially sometimes they are under pressure because of the growth in the heat-not-burn category. Chris, we are just reminding everybody that maintaining our leadership in CC is an absolute priority. We need this leadership in order to make sure that we keep the link with the smoker that we want to convert in order to keep the impact with the trade to bring our RRP offering to customers and of course, for the financial resources that it provide in order to invest behind RRP, so you should expect us to continue to invest on CC to maintain this market share. It is clear that, although it's not going to be the majority but there will be some investment in the second-half on the CC business as we defend our business. And as we see some of the markets where we've been sometimes hit hard by the COVID and we talk about the social consumption that has been hitting [ph] Marlboro. Well, as we think the world is back to more social life in the second-half that will probably be a time to be back on making sure that we maintain and further strengthen the leadership on Marlboro as an example.\nChris Growe: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you for the color.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Pamela Kaufman of Morgan Stanley.\nPamela Kaufman: So I just wanted to come back to understanding your guidance and the cadence for this year given the strength in the first quarter and outlook for Q2, your guidance for EPS implies a moderation from about mid 20% growth in the first-half to high-single-digit growth in the second-half, and obviously, you pointed to added incremental investments, but are there any other factors impacting the second-half outlook? Because even when adjusting for the added incremental spend, it implies a notable moderation in growth. So just trying to understand what's considering the fact [ph]...\nEmmanuel Babeau: So, Pamela...\nPamela Kaufman: [Multiple Speakers] how conservative it might be?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Happy to take that one. So I'm sure we've highlighted the fact that the Q1 margin has been helped of course by some deferral of investment on SG&A and we signaled the fact that we'll be much more active in H2, and the $300 million to $400 million extra investment versus the first-half but we also signaled that gross margin has been -- I mean, the performance on the gross margin is absolutely impressive in Q1, and we're going to deliver a very strong performance on gross margin rate improvements through the year. But we flagged the fact that Q1 has been boosted as well by non-recurring element on manufacturing productivity and therefore we think that as it's not going to be reproduced, we're going to have here a moderation. We also are going to face -- and that was Bonnie's question previously, some impact coming from the launch of ILUMA and the consumable of ILUMA where there will be some pressure on gross margin because of it is -- of the launch and the time for the ramp up on manufacturing productivity and we will have also a number of investments that will be in the gross margin on distribution in the second-half. So, if you combine the fact that Q1 was exceptional for a few reasons and the fact that there is boost [ph] at the gross margin level in Q2, some element that will be impacting negatively plus increase investment that is driving the outlook for the margin in the second-half. Although, as I said, we're going to keep with a very nice margin improvement but I'm sure you've noted that already.\nPamela Kaufman: Thank you. Also, I just wanted to ask about IQOS VEEV learnings and performance in your initial launch market. I understand you're leveraging your existing IQOS platform to commercialize VEEV. So how are you steering consumers across the various products?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes. So as at stage, Pamela, it's very early stage, few market very preliminary. We have very good feedback from customers reflecting the fact that it's a superior experience versus most traditional vaping experience. So we are collecting the data we are reviewing the first information coming from these markets and when we have a bit more element to share, we'll do that. I would say for the time being on the limited number of markets and with very small volume, we are happy with the qualitative feedback that we are getting from these markets.\nPamela Kaufman: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. Our final question will come from the line of Gaurav Jain of Barclays.\nGaurav Jain: Hi, thank you. Good morning, Emmanuel.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Hi, Gaurav.\nGaurav Jain: Coming back to the questions which have been asked on repeated earnings beat and earnings coming ahead of guidance, how does this impact your thought process around the magnitude and timing of share repurchases?\nEmmanuel Babeau: I don't think that this is having a meaningful impact, Gaurav. I think we've signaled previously that we are absolutely on track, provided of course that we receive board approval to start share buyback in the second-half of the year as announced at the time of the Investor Day. I'm not sure that at that stage, we are building a strategy based on that. As I said, I am hopeful that with the COVID headwind abating, we're going to be a better forecaster in the future for our quarterly guidance. So I don't take that as a kind of element that would be here to stay.\nGaurav Jain: Sure. Thank you. And my second question is on -- and maybe I'm incorrect in what I'm saying, but as I understand, a part of IQOS is [ph] about 6 grams of tobacco, while a pack of cigarettes has 16-gram of tobacco. So does it imply that a pack of IQOS has lower nicotine versus a pack of cigarettes, which could therefore be something which helps you in this debate around nicotine caps?\nEmmanuel Babeau: No, Gaurav, not necessarily. It has an impact on some time in some country, not everywhere on the excise duty because excise duty is on the weight of tobacco in several countries in the world, but the weight of tobacco is not directly going to guide the nicotine content that you're going to inhale through IQOS consumption versus combustible consumption.\nGaurav Jain: Okay. Brilliant. And thanks a lot.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you. Thank you very much.\nOperator: That was our final question. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.\nNicholas Rolli: Well, thank you very much.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nNicholas Rolli: That concludes our call today. Sorry, Emmanuel, unless you had a comment.\nEmmanuel Babeau: No, no, I was just to thank everybody for attending the call today, and we look forward to talk to you soon.\nNicholas Rolli: Thank you. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations team. Thank you, again, and have a great day.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Bye-bye. Bye, everybody.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I hope everyone listening to the call is safe and well. Our business delivered a strong performance in the first quarter of 2021 well ahead of expectations, reaching a record high quarterly adjusted diluted EPS of $1.57, despite the continued challenges of the global pandemic. Most impressive was the continued strong growth of IQOS, which made up 13% of our volumes and 28% of our net revenues compared to 21.7% in the prior year quarter. We continued converting adult smokers at a very good pace and reached an estimated total of 19.1 million users, of which 14 million have switched to IQOS and stopped smoking. HTU shipment volumes grew plus 30% compared to the prior year quarter with record market shares in key IQOS geographies, 12 markets with double-digit national share and the share of 7.6% overall in IQOS markets excluding the U.S. Our operating margins were also significantly above the prior year quarter, and while somewhat flattered by timing factors, the bulk of this improvement reflect strong underlying performance. The resulting combination of strong organic net revenue and adjusted diluted EPS growth leads us to raise our outlook for the year. From a product standpoint, we continue to broaden our smoke-free portfolio and saw encouraging progress from new device and consumable offerings across multiple markets. We expect to benefit from further innovation through the course of 2021. Turning to the headline numbers. Our Q1 net revenues grew by plus 2.9% on an organic basis. This was an excellent performance in the context of an essentially pre-COVID prior year comparison and incorporates better than expected HTU, IMS and shipment volumes, which drove plus 32% organic growth in RRP net revenue. We also saw some higher-than-expected pull forward of shipments, predominantly cigarettes in the EU region, ahead of the Easter period and in Russia ahead of the April 1 discount ban. We saw strong organic growth of plus 6.9% in our net revenue per unit, driven by the increasing weight of IQOS in our sales mix and pricing on both combustible and RRPs. Combustible tobacco pricing was plus 2.7% of prior year combustible net revenues, reflecting solid pricing in many markets, partially offset by Indonesia. Excluding Indonesia, combustible pricing was over plus 4%. Our adjusted operating income margin increased by 580 basis points on an organic basis. This reflects the increasing weight and profitability of IQOS; the positive impact of pricing; productivity savings, including lower device cost; lower commercial spend due to the pandemic; the favorable comparison in Eastern Europe and certain other timing factors. Combined with a lower effective tax rate, our resulting adjusted diluted EPS of $1.57 represent plus 21.5% organic growth, a very strong performance. We estimate the timing factors in the quarter, such as the earlier shipment mentioned and cost phasing had a positive impact of around plus $0.08. Although one-time factors accounted for an estimated further plus $0.02 increase. This brings me now to guidance for 2021. While the speed and shape of the global recovery from the pandemic remains uncertain, the strong business results and underlying momentum of the first quarter, notably from our IQOS business, lead us to raise our outlook. We continue to account for a range of outcomes in our outlook for organic growth in net revenue and EPS. This range, assume that even in the event of renewed or prolonged restriction, we will not see a return to the depressed consumption level of Q2 2020. While we have not been affected thus far by the current global shortage of semiconductor, the guidance assumes a limited impact on the supply of electronic devices to consumer. This is a fluid situation which we are monitoring closely and where any constraint may arise, we intend to manage our inventories accordingly and prioritize device sales to other smokers who are new to the category. Regarding duty-free, a rebound in global travel is likely to lag the improvement of in-country mobility. Our guidance continue to assume no meaningful recovery in duty-free this year. We now expect organic net revenue growth in the range of plus 5% to plus 7% versus plus 4% to plus 7% communicated previously and organic adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 11% to plus 13% or plus 15% to plus 17% in reported terms. The strength of IQOS is the main driver for this revision. We now expect to deliver HTU shipment volume of between 95 billion and 100 billion units, representing the upper half of our previously targeted range for 2021. Given the continued strong momentum across our market, the need to maintain inventory duration and preparation for the rollout of IQOS ILUMA that uses different consumable, we expect our full-year shipment to be slightly ahead of our IMS volumes. We also raised our assumption for organic adjusted OI margin expansion to around plus 200 basis points. This includes the expectation of greater investment in the second-half as our innovation and commercial activities step up. As detailed in this morning's press release, our other main assumptions remain unchanged. This projected organic EPS growth, including an estimated favorable currency impact of approximately plus $0.20 at prevailing rates versus plus $0.25 assume previously, translate into a raised adjusted diluted EPS range of $5.95 to $6 or $5. This guidance does not include any impact of share repurchases. However, we remain on track to resume repurchases in the second-half of the year subject to Board approval. Looking forward to the second quarter, we now expect adjusted diluted EPS of $1.50 to $1.55, reflecting strong topline growth against a weak prior year comparison, continued margin improvement and a partial reversal of certain Q1 timing benefit. For the second-half, assuming that many of our key market will have largely emerged from COVID restriction, we expect continued robust top line growth. This include the contribution of higher expected device shipments, which will result in less gross margin expansion, compared to the first-half. New product launches, investments in distribution and the phasing of productivities will also play a role. We will also step up our commercial investment in the future growth of RRP through portfolio and geographic expansion, including product launches such as IQOS ILUMA. We anticipate around plus $300 million to plus $400 million of incremental commercial investment compared to the first-half and consequently expect our organic OI margin expansion to be lower in H2, but overall, to deliver a strong expansion of around plus 200 basis point for the year. Before discussing our results in more depth, I want to highlight a few of the positive regulatory developments in the quarter. Recognition of the harm reduction potential of smoke-free product continues to gain traction. Example, so far this year includes the reversal of a long-standing import ban on heated tobacco product in Uruguay and the integration of the harm reduction principle in Lithuania's tobacco control agenda. We also note the recent report from an all-party parliamentary group of MPs in the UK, calling for the WHO to return to the founding principle of the FCTC, which includes harms reduction rather than the current prohibitionist stance. In New Zealand, we are reviewing the content and detail of the consultation paper published last week. The policy recognizes the role of innovative product in harm reduction, while at the same time, ensuring strict control to prevent youth access. In the EU, we continue to be hopeful that the revision of the tobacco excise directive will lead to greater amortization in the effort to smoke-free product, taking into account the relevant good practices and experience gained by member states in this area. Here and around the world, we continue to support differentiated regulatory and fiscal framework based on the relative risk to health. While there will on occasion be actions or proposals that do not incorporate harm reduction objectives, we believe that facts and science will guide policy over time and we continue to see positive changes in many geographies. Well, turning back now to our results, Q1 shipment volumes declined by 3.7% on the total PMI business. This reflects continued strong growth from HTUs of plus 30% to reach 21.7 billion units, driven by the EU region, Japan, Russia, Ukraine and an encouraging start from recently launched market in the Middle East. HTU shipment and IMS volumes were broadly in line for the quarter. While pandemic-related restriction persisted around the world, total industry volume declines of 0.7% were relatively benign incorporating over plus 25% growth in the heated tobacco category where we continue to have a share of over 80%. Though less severe than in Q4 2020, our cigarette volume declines reflect specific share headwind in certain markets, which I'll come back to. We expect better combustible share and volume trends in both the second quarter and second-half of the year. The strong performance from IQOS led to heated tobacco units, comprising 13% of our total shipment volume in Q1 as compared to 9.6% in the prior year quarter, 11% in the year of 2020, 8% in 2019 and 5% in 2018. We continue to expect this proportion to grow over time as a positive momentum on IQOS continues, providing a powerful driver of revenue and margin growth. Our sales mix is changing rapidly, putting us on track to achieve our aim of becoming a majority smoke-free company by 2025. Smoke-free products made up 28% of our total net revenue in the quarter compared to 21.7% in Q1 2020. IQOS devices accounted for approximately 6% of the $2.1 billion of RRP net revenue, reflecting longer replacement time for existing users due to improving battery lives and reliability, and lower device price in certain markets as we are preparing for IQOS ILUMA. The plus 2.9% organic growth in Q1 net revenue on shipment volume decline of 3.7% reflect the twin engine driving our topline. First is pricing on combustible and in certain market on HTU net of the lower device pricing I just mentioned. Second, the increasing mix of HTUs in our business at higher net revenue per unit continue to deliver substantial growth. And as explained at Investor Day, this is an increasingly powerful driver as our transformation accelerates. Let me now go into the driver of our first quarter margin expansion, starting with gross margin, which expanded by 390 basis points on an organic basis. This is driven by multiple levers as shown in green on this slide, including the mix effect of HTU within IQOS impact, in particular, our significant efforts on manufacturing and supply chain efficiency are bearing fruit, more than offsetting the effect of combustible volume declines, with around $150 million of gross productivity savings delivered in Q1. While somewhat front-loaded in the context of 2021, this represents a strong start on the journey towards our target of $1 billion over 2021-2023. As part of these savings, our gross profit increase was boosted by better absorption of manufacturing costs given a high level of production in the quarter and lower device costs with combined impact of around plus $60 million. Gross margin expansion was also accompanied by strong SG&A efficiencies with our adjusted marketing administration and research costs 200 basis points lower as a percentage of net revenue on an organic basis. This reflects the ongoing digitalization and simplification of our business processes, including our IQOS commercial engine and more efficient ways of working. We delivered around $60 million towards our '21-'23 target of $1 billion in gross SG&A savings before inflation and reinvestments. The pandemic also impacted SG&A costs in the quarter through the later timing of certain projects and reduced commercial and overhead costs due to ongoing restrictions. These latter factors accounted for around $100 million of the organic improvement. Focusing now on combustible, we continue to hold the leading international portfolio by market share and by brand strengths as covered at Investor Day. This gives us a formidable platform to accelerate the growth of IQOS via our commercial infrastructure, industry expertise and ability to communicate with other smokers where permitted. It is therefore imperative to maintain our leadership through selective investment as we also drive returns through pricing and efficiency. Our cigarette share underperformance in Q1 can be attributed to the combination of several factors. This includes the COVID impact on social occasion, where Marlboro overindexes; border closures and reduced travel; and instances of downtrading and competition in the mid and low-price segments in certain markets such as the Philippines and part of the EU region. This performance does not reflect our objective to maintain our share of cigarettes, net of cannibalization. We expect a strong sequential cigarette share recovery through the remainder of the year supported by portfolio initiatives and the enduring strength of Marlboro especially as pandemic restrictions ease. Accordingly, we target cigarette share to be about stable on the year-over-year basis for the next nine months, despite the impact of cannibalization. Share gains from HTUs will come on top of this. I will now turn to the South and Southeast Asia Region. After a difficult 2020, notably in Indonesia, headwinds are now moderating. In Indonesia, volume trends are improving with double-digit growth in hand-rolled kreteks, where we are the market leader supporting stable PMI share in the Tier 1 segment. Indeed, with industry volume recovering, we are targeting volume growth for our business here in 2021. Pricing remain the main headwind in Indonesia. New excise duty rates came into force on February 1, and while all major players have taken some pricing, progress nonetheless remains slow. Despite the negative consequences for government revenues, there has not yet been a significant move to level the playing field between the Tier 1 and below Tier 1 segment, which continues to grow. We remain hopeful that the government will address this issue over time. The Philippines has performed well in recent years. For this quarter, further industry pricing in H2 2020, a slow economic recovery and pandemic-linked restriction gave rise to a double-digit market decline. Our share loss reflects downtrading from the mid to low-price segment, with premium-priced Marlboro which make up over two-third of our volume growing share. Notwithstanding these challenges, we have plans to address the share decline and are targeting close to stable organic net revenue in 2021 despite the total market weakness. I'm also pleased to say that IQOS is off to an encouraging start in Metro Manila, with an exit share of almost 1% for HEETS after full launch in Q3 2020. Overall, this region delivered strong growth pre-COVID. While it may not be a meaningful growth driver in 2021, we expect far less of a drag on group result compared to 2020. We target regional organic net revenue to be at least stable over the next nine months. Moving now to IQOS performance, we estimate there were 19.1 million IQOS users as of March 31. This represents the addition of around 1.5 million adult users since December building on the step-up in the second-half of 2020. Our accelerated pivot to digital and remote engagement during the pandemic, combined with strong momentum for the IQOS brand is paying off. We further estimate that 73% of this total of 14 million adult smokers have switched to IQOS and stopped smoking, with the balance in various stages of conversion. Strong conversion rates notably reflect the increased prevalence of IQOS 3 DUO, which offers a superior user experience to previous device versions. As we mentioned at Investor Day, we seek to achieve even higher conversion rate over time with introduction of innovation, such as IQOS ILUMA. This user growth again reflects widespread momentum across all key IQOS geographies, including the EU region, Japan and Russia. It also reflects the enrichment of our offer and the segmentation of the category with new product and more price points, both above and below our initial HTU offering. In the EU region, first quarter share for HEETS reached a record 5.7% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume. Adjusted for estimated trade inventory movements, this reflects 46% year-over-year. IMS growth and around 10% sequential IMS growth accounting for fewer selling days in the period. I would also remind you of the sequential quarterly share dynamic, which can be distorted by the seasonality of the combustible market in addition to pandemic-related situations such as border closure and other social restrictions. With the region likely to reopen somewhat in Q2 and increase the total market, we expect further strong underlying HTU growth, but for share to be broadly in line with Q1. This excellent performance includes strong growth in Italy, surpassing 10% share, with the large majority of user acquisition coming organically as the increasing awareness and prominence of the product build its own momentum. Germany and Poland were also strong contributors. We added a further 700,000 EU region IQOS users in the quarter to reach 5.9 million, a continuation of recent strong performance. We continue to see phenomenal progress in key cities across the EU region, with a number of examples on this slide. HTU share in Rome is now approaching 20%. Warsaw and Lisbon reached 15%, Munich 8%, and London 5%. While a smaller city, the progress in Vilnius at 36% share is also a global standout. As covered at Investor Day, key cities are a good indicator of national share growth potential and I would also refer you to the appendix where we show shares for key EU market and global key cities. Strong performance continued in Russia, with our HTU share up by 1.2 points to reach a record 7.7%. Adjusted for estimated trade inventory movements, this reflect plus 35% year-over-year IMS growth and around plus 8%-10% sequentially once estimated consumer pantry loading effects are factored in. We continue to see sequential share growth for both our HEETS and Fiit lineup with good traction for the regular HEETS and super-premium HEETS creation variants. Moreover LIL SOLID and Fiit consumable continue to supplement user acquisition. In both Russia and Ukraine, the majority of consumer purchasing a LIL device are smokers entering the smoke-free category for the first time, with high level of conversion in line with IQOS. This bodes well for our ability to reach adult smoker in the medium and below price segments for whom purchasing power may be a barrier. Margins on midstream-priced HTUs such as Fiit remain attractive compared to cigarettes sold at the same price, and while the volume of Fiit remains small compared to our total HTU volume in this market given our large IQOS user base, we expect LIL to grow further in 2021. With this success in Russia and Ukraine, we plan to offer LIL SOLID in additional markets later this year. In Japan, on a total tobacco basis, including cigarillos and adjusted for trade inventory movements, the share for our HTU brands increased by 3 points versus the prior year quarter and by 0.7 points sequentially to 20.8%. Both HEETS and Marlboro HeatSticks grew market share following the October price increase, highlighting the strength of our price-tiered portfolio. We expect to see further HTU volume growth in Japan over the remainder of the year underpinned by ongoing user acquisition. For the second quarter in particular we expect robust sequential IMS growth. We also expect a recovery in the total tobacco market as the elasticity effect of the substantial October price increase fade, including on consumer pantry-loading. As such, while year-over-year share growth is still likely to be strong, Q2 share may not reflect this underlying sequential growth performance and may be broadly stable versus Q1 on an adjusted basis including cigarillos. In Q1, the overall heated tobacco category made up over 28% of the adjusted total Japanese tobacco market with IQOS maintaining a high share of segment. IQOS HTUs also reached an offtake share of 26.1% in Tokyo, after surpassing the 25% milestone in December. In addition to strong growth in existing markets, the geographic expansion of our smoke-free product continues. This allows us to provide access to better alternatives to an even increasing amount of adult smoker and as communicated at Investor Day, we aim to be in 100 markets by 2025. After launching in 12 new markets with IQOS in 2020, we added Aruba in the first quarter and launched our new e-vapor product IQOS VEEV in Finland, which takes the total number of markets where PMI smoke-free products are available for sale to 66, of which over half are outside the OECD. We are continuing to commercialize IQOS VEEV with Q1 launches in Italy, and as I just mentioned, Finland. This follows the initial launch market New Zealand and the Czech Republic in H2 2020. One of our key priorities is guarding against youth access for all our products and we are targeting for all our electronic smoke-free devices to be equipped with age verification technology by 2023. We will be testing this technology with IQOS VEEV in select markets this year. IQOS VEEV is a premium product, providing a superior experience and as we explained previously, the commercial infrastructure of IQOS allows us to deploy efficiently and at scale through a bespoke route-to-market approach. Our other market -- major innovation for 2021 is the launch of IQOS ILUMA, the next generation of IQOS, as announced at Investor Day. Building on the success of IQOS 3 DUO, we believe this simple and intuitive device will support easier switching and higher condition for legal-age smokers using Smartcore internal induction heating technology. We continue to plan for the launch of ILUMA in the second-half of the year. As we roll out both IQOS VEEV and IQOS ILUMA, we carefully plan our manufacturing and supply chain activities to manage expected demand, and external factors such as the current tightness of global semiconductor supply that I mentioned previously. The ongoing success of IQOS 3 DUO more than two years after launch demonstrates that significant innovation can have a lasting positive impact on growth, and both our recently announced 2023 HTU shipment volume target, and the upward revision of our HTU target for this year reflect this confidence. Our transformation is the bedrock for both business and sustainability performance. We do not have separate strategies, phasing out cigarettes by replacing them with better alternatives such as IQOS drives our growth and addresses our biggest impact on society. Our unique commitment to phasing out cigarettes is underlined by the new transformation targets announced at Investor Day, which are aligned with the 27 Business Transformation Metrics provided for stakeholders to measure and verify the pace and scale of our progress. This includes our ambition to become a majority smoke-free company by 2025, our aim to commercialize smoke-free products in 100 markets, and to generate at least $1 billion in net revenue from beyond nicotine products as we move into adjacent business areas with a net positive impact on society. Our best-in-class performance on ESG allows us to further our leadership in sustainability. I am proud to see increasing external recognition for example on our efforts to develop a fully sustainable supply chain and our commitment to address gender inequality. Further, we recently of data that was zero deforestation manifesto, strengthening our ambition undertaking to conserving forests across our entire value chain. We remain strongly committed to providing the highest level of disclosure on the key ESG and product impact areas of our company via integrated reporting and we released our 2020 disclosure on May 18. We recognize that EFG analysis can provide valuable insights about factors with a significant potential impact on financial performance and thus better inform investment decision. To further maximize the value of investor engagement and aid understanding of the significant positive impact PMI's transformation can have on society, we plan to hold a sustainability webcast in early June, building on our recent Investor Day. Please do mark your calendars. To conclude, we've had a strong start to the year and look forward with confidence despite the continued uncertainty on the operating environment due to COVID. This is the same concluding slide I presented at Investor Day in February, as I believe our start to 2021 demonstrates all of the key elements of our longer-term trajectory. Through IQOS we are building a business with multiple levers to deliver superior and sustainable growth over the coming year through improved volume dynamic, excellent topline growth, strong margin expansion and fast-growing earnings. Moreover, while every adult smoker who switches to IQOS is good for our business, it is also a clear positive for our impact on society and public health. We manage our transformation with care and responsibility for our stakeholders, guided by our sustainability materiality framework to maximize our positive impact across our Tier 1 ESG and product areas. This is essential for the sustainability of our business, and for delivering superior returns for shareholders over the long term. The increase in our organic growth outlook for 2021 is another step on this journey, also putting us nicely on track to achieve our 2023 financial and HTU shipment targets. Thank you. I am now more than happy to answer your questions. Good morning, Vivien. So, I guess, Vivien, if I understand, well, your question is, how is our heat-not-burn offer and product classified versus combustible cigarette in our non-U.S. geographies. Correct? Right. So I'm not sure that I'm going to be able to give one general answer because the classification can be different from one country to the other. I would say, today, probably the fact that the excise duty applied to our IQOS product is differentiated in the vast majority of the markets show that the treatment is differentiated, so the product is addressed already in a distinct manner on that particular element recognizing that it's a different product with a different feature than the combustible cigarettes. So we are, of course, going to see some situation that can be different from one market to the other. We are certainly welcoming a regulation that will further clarify the fact that these heat-not-burn products are clearly different and a better alternative to combustible in the future. And as I think I mentioned, we see the regulation progressing nicely country after country to take that into account, have been taking a few example during my previous speech and we expect that to continue. So, we expect more and more government regulated to further clarify distinction between heat-not-burn and other reduced risk products and combustible cigarettes and come as well with different regulation. And as you know, we are calling for a differentiated approach on two items. Certainly, on the way, we can communicate on these better alternatives and better product than the combustible cigarette. And also, of course, on taxation to make sure that we have an incentive to push the smokers to this better alternative for their health. Well, I think that is something that as you rightly say, Vivien, is not implemented anywhere today. And I think it's an idea that certainly would have to be investigated in all its dimension. I think that could have a number of impact in term of illicit trade, in term of people smoking, actually more combustible product to get to the same kind of nicotine dose and of course, therefore with negative impact. So I think at that stage, frankly, it's too early to say whether this is something that could have the right intent. In any case, that would have to be coupled with very strong awareness, availability of better alternative and certainly, starting with heat-not-burn if we were to work, and that should be perceived as an incentive for people to quit smoking or to switch to this better alternative and certainly, heat-not-burn being the first one that could be perceived as a nice and satisfying alternative for smokers wanting to go for better product. So, I think that the idea is -- and it's not new, because I think the FDA had put the idea on the table already in 2017. I don't think that much work has been done so far on all the potential consequences. We believe that a lot of work would have to be done on the impact and the loss of scientific evidence would have to be gathered and studied on that. And in any case, for us, that would have to be coupled with a very strong awareness, availability and present that as an alternative for people who don't want to quit, but want to keep consuming nicotine. You're welcome. How are you? Yes. Sure, Owen. So on the commercial spending, of course, here it's expecting, we believe realistically, that in many markets, the situation on COVID will gradually improve. So everybody believe that in many markets with the vaccination and positive evolution starting in the summer, we're going to see a switch to a gradual improvement. So, as you know, during a significant period of time, because of COVID, we've been somewhat limited restricted in commercial action, I would say, across the portfolio, but of course, starting on our IQOS business. So as we see the market opening up, it will, in a general manner, be time to be back on communication, on making our IQOS product known, build awareness, again, around IQOS is absolutely key in building our IQOS business and obviously, that will trigger more commercial and marketing activity. On top of that, you're absolutely right, that will be a period of very important launch with ILUMA and VEEV. Although VEEV has been started to be launched, we expect a number of markets in the second part of the year. We see exactly what is the final number. We want to make sure that we do that well with the right focus. On ILUMA, you can expect key market to be first on the priority list for launch. So I'm not going to disclose at that stage the names, but you shouldn't expect key market for us on IQOS to be coming very first on the list. And of course, that will require specific investment to make sure that smokers or other already RRP user understand what is the benefit of ILUMA, why it is an even greater product than the IQOS 3 DUO and generating more conversion, more loyalty to our product, so that we require nice investment in the second part of the year. So that is really what is behind this $300 million to $400 million that we are mentioning here. Hi, Bonnie. Yes, sure, Bonnie, happy to answer on these two points. So on the impact of ILUMA, we broadly expect ILUMA to be positive. Well, first of all, of course, on acquiring new smokers, and converting new smokers, because you're going to find more intuitive, easier to use products and we make on convince with ILUMA smokers that we did not manage to convince so far. So that's the first element. Second, of course, we're going to also have a number of IQOS user or other heat-not-burn tobacco product user switching to ILUMA because it's really a severe product with a lot of benefit for the consumer. And lastly, because we believe that in term of loyalty and people fully adopting the heat-not-burn practices and not moving back to cigarettes, the fact that it's a better product is also going to play a very nice role. So we expect to have people abandoning and switching back to cigarette to be nicely lower once again because it's much easier to use, it's an overall better experience and we think it's going to be really having a nice impact on that one. So as you can see, we expect several drivers behind this ILUMA innovation to further boost our performance on the IQOS globally. Regarding consumable and globally as a launch, I would say you should expect like always when you launch a new product, you are coming with a product [ph], not fully optimized in term of manufacturing productivity. It's a new product; at the beginning, the volume are low; you've made some investment; it takes some time to be fully optimized. So there will be beyond the cost of launching the product for marketing and commercial reason. There will be some impact at the gross margin level at the beginning because it's a new product and there will be a ramp up on the profitability of this new product and on the consumable margin on this new product. And that is of course taken into account in our guidance. So just on the second one, on VEEV, It is certainly our intention at a certain point in time to submit PMTA. We have not done it yet, and I don't have the timeline yet when we do that, but yes, it is certainly our intention to do that at a certain point in time. Now on growing the IQOS business, of course, we will work with our partner, Altria there. Remember, we are not commercializing IQOS in the US. We have licensed the IQOS commercialization to Altria. Let's not overreact to what is even [ph] not the news, I think it's a press article yesterday and therefore we should not run too fast to a conclusion or believe that the world is going to change overnight. I think it's just a press article. But now, we are convinced that the FDA has one clear objective, which is to promote a policy for harm reduction that will go through innovation and based on scientific evidence and they want to supervise that, the MRTP that we received on IQOS 2.4 signal [ph] that they see IQOS as a positive contribution and according to their own world, that it's appropriate to promote public health. So that means that we have with IQOS a role to play that we believe that this vision of the FDA is something that we can accompany and that we can foster and help to develop with our innovation and with IQOS, and of course, we'll make sure that with Altria, we try to maximize what we can do there Thank you. Hi, Adam. Well, I think certainly the element, but I'm sure you have that in mind that you need to take into account is, first of all, that there is an underlying seasonality in many markets that is impacting the volume on CC and therefore the denominator being impacted that is even if IQOS continue to grow and globally heat-not-burn continue to grow very nicely that is impacting the overall market share. And in addition to that, the COVID impact on border closure impacts, impact on illicit and some market that was not tracked that emerge and that was mainly CC business, of course, there again, changing the denominator has been impacting the market share. So it's going to be a mix we believe in 2021 still with impact from the COVID of this normal seasonality plus the specific impact linked to the COVID. Now, we target a progressive growth overall, but it's true that on certain markets, we may have after a very strong acceleration in one quarter, for all this reason, the following quarter that could be with the lower growth and even stable -- of course year-on-year, it's still very strong growth. But you appreciate that. It's sequentially that the market share is potentially not growing at the same pace. It doesn't mean of course that the volume even sequentially are not growing either [ph] you can have volume growing as well with the market share stable. So I think market share has to be taken with a pinch of salt and should be appreciated over a longer period of time to be meaningful in what they say [ph]. Yes, Adam. So taking your challenge on guidance and what we deliver, I would identify two sources for -- and two reasons, two [ph] driver for beating often the guidance. The first one and I think it's a good one, is the fact that we are often surprised by the strength of the IQOS business. So we expect something and it's coming even stronger, which is a case in this Q1 for some of the beat. So we are trying to make a fair assessment of what we can expect, and then when things are coming better, we take that as a good news, but it's true, we've been too cautious in the way we've been forecasting. The other one, which I hope everybody understand, is that in today's environment, it's more difficult to anticipate, predict things because you have a lot of volatility, and we've been -- it's true, surprised by things that we did not necessarily anticipated well and that can be a spending that we thought we would do even in March and that we eventually did not do, and in term of investment and we are going to do that later in the year or some movement in market that were not well anticipated. Again, with the COVID impact creating a lot of nervousness, volatility, and frankly, somewhat a roller coaster in some of the attitude of the trade and then -- and even pantry-loading from customers. So that would be really the true driver explaining why we've been beating on the few occasion, our guidance. And when we know early in the quarter that we're going to beat, I mean we share with that when it really happened at the end of the quarter, I think we believe that it's -- it becomes clear at the stage where we say we're going to -- we see that very close to the communication if [ph] you want. Now, on your challenge of -- or your question of, does it mean that the market is no longer following you. Well, I don't think this is a case. I think everybody understand the specificity of this COVID situation and accept that there can be volatility and things that we don't anticipated -- anticipate well. And then you know on the strength of IQOS, I think everybody can have a view on what we can deliver. I think we are today revising towards [ph] the guidance on the number of HeatSticks for the year to 95 billion to 100 billion. I think based on the Q1 that's really sharing with all investors, shareholder analysts, the best possible assumption that we can make and really reflecting our vision at that stage. Thank you. Hi, Michael. Sure, Mike. Happy to do that. What is happening on our IQOS business and on the consumable is typically what you would expect in a market -- consumer good market where things start to mature a little bit. And I'm using this word with a lot of cautiousness of course because it's a very young market still, but in a few markets like Japan, for instance, a few other markets where we are not double-digit market share, it's maturing a little bit. So typically, the consumer -- the customer will expect based on his purchasing power, based on his personal lifestyle and what he wants to enjoy or what he wants to say about his life or her life around him. We'll want to have different I would say positioning on what he is consuming. So when you go for innovation, what we did with the HEETS consumable, you have one single reference at the beginning. And then rapidly, you see the need for segmenting the market, there is a category of the consumer that will be very keen to have an even severe experience. So to get to an even better consumable and ready to pay more for that, so to have higher expenses that's what we have with whether the Marlboro HeatSticks in Japan or HEETS creation in Russia, you keep the premium below the hyper [ph] premium if you want. And then, at a certain point in time, there is also a need for a medium and probably later in the future for a medium minimum positioning because other consumers will be keen to have an inferior overall experience but still great rewarding versus what they used to have with the same category of combustible and of course, at a lower price point. So I think we're just doing the right commercial marketing job to make sure that we give satisfaction to all the expectation of our customers. It happens gradually, it's relevant yet in every country. But as more and more country are becoming a bit mature, that will become increasingly relevant in more and more market in the future. No, Michael, there is no concern of inventory bill whatsoever, that certainly the level of cigarillo, remember that is a specific category. The tax advantage will fully disappear next October but there is still, until now, a very dynamic category in Japan. So what we are, as I said, seeing in Japan has been following the October excise duty increase and price increase. A very, very nice reaction from our IQOS business altogether both Marlboro HeatSticks and HEETS, we've been gaining very nice market share at the end of the year 2020 in Q4. It continued in Q1 and therefore we are disclosing very positive and genuine market share growth during the last two quarters and we are very happy with it. Thank you. Hi, Chris. Well, clearly, we said it in Russia, we have not a full coverage of the country yet. In the EU, we have a number of countries where we are in the big cities, but not yet with an important full coverage, I would say with a lot of capillarity I think Yatsik [ph], at the time of the Investor Day, highlighted the market share that we have in key cities and signal that if we look backwards, the market share a few years upstream are good -- in big cities are a good indication of where you can get the whole market, a few years down the road. So, I think that's a pretty good indicator of the fact that we manage, of course, to get an even higher market share in key cities and the overall country and the fact that we have done that in key cities mean that we are very likely if we continue to do a good job to reach the same kind of market share globally for the country. But of course, it's not the end of the road because at the same time, we kept increasing share in the big cities, so it's an ongoing improvement if you want. But that's I think the way you should be looking at things. I mean we are certainly seeing competition quite active on combustible because for many of them, they have only little presence in RRP. So they are trying to protect and build their business there and especially sometimes they are under pressure because of the growth in the heat-not-burn category. Chris, we are just reminding everybody that maintaining our leadership in CC is an absolute priority. We need this leadership in order to make sure that we keep the link with the smoker that we want to convert in order to keep the impact with the trade to bring our RRP offering to customers and of course, for the financial resources that it provide in order to invest behind RRP, so you should expect us to continue to invest on CC to maintain this market share. It is clear that, although it's not going to be the majority but there will be some investment in the second-half on the CC business as we defend our business. And as we see some of the markets where we've been sometimes hit hard by the COVID and we talk about the social consumption that has been hitting [ph] Marlboro. Well, as we think the world is back to more social life in the second-half that will probably be a time to be back on making sure that we maintain and further strengthen the leadership on Marlboro as an example. Thank you. So, Pamela... Happy to take that one. So I'm sure we've highlighted the fact that the Q1 margin has been helped of course by some deferral of investment on SG&A and we signaled the fact that we'll be much more active in H2, and the $300 million to $400 million extra investment versus the first-half but we also signaled that gross margin has been -- I mean, the performance on the gross margin is absolutely impressive in Q1, and we're going to deliver a very strong performance on gross margin rate improvements through the year. But we flagged the fact that Q1 has been boosted as well by non-recurring element on manufacturing productivity and therefore we think that as it's not going to be reproduced, we're going to have here a moderation. We also are going to face -- and that was Bonnie's question previously, some impact coming from the launch of ILUMA and the consumable of ILUMA where there will be some pressure on gross margin because of it is -- of the launch and the time for the ramp up on manufacturing productivity and we will have also a number of investments that will be in the gross margin on distribution in the second-half. So, if you combine the fact that Q1 was exceptional for a few reasons and the fact that there is boost [ph] at the gross margin level in Q2, some element that will be impacting negatively plus increase investment that is driving the outlook for the margin in the second-half. Although, as I said, we're going to keep with a very nice margin improvement but I'm sure you've noted that already. Yes. So as at stage, Pamela, it's very early stage, few market very preliminary. We have very good feedback from customers reflecting the fact that it's a superior experience versus most traditional vaping experience. So we are collecting the data we are reviewing the first information coming from these markets and when we have a bit more element to share, we'll do that. I would say for the time being on the limited number of markets and with very small volume, we are happy with the qualitative feedback that we are getting from these markets. Hi, Gaurav. I don't think that this is having a meaningful impact, Gaurav. I think we've signaled previously that we are absolutely on track, provided of course that we receive board approval to start share buyback in the second-half of the year as announced at the time of the Investor Day. I'm not sure that at that stage, we are building a strategy based on that. As I said, I am hopeful that with the COVID headwind abating, we're going to be a better forecaster in the future for our quarterly guidance. So I don't take that as a kind of element that would be here to stay. No, Gaurav, not necessarily. It has an impact on some time in some country, not everywhere on the excise duty because excise duty is on the weight of tobacco in several countries in the world, but the weight of tobacco is not directly going to guide the nicotine content that you're going to inhale through IQOS consumption versus combustible consumption. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. No, no, I was just to thank everybody for attending the call today, and we look forward to talk to you soon. Bye-bye. Bye, everybody."

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International Management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. James Bushnell, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.\nJames Bushnell: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2022 fourth quarter and full year results. You may access the release on pmi.com. A glossary of terms including the definition for the smoke-free products as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly-comparable U.S. GAAP measures and additional smoke-free volume and net revenue data are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Growth rates presented on an organic basis reflect currency-neutral adjusted results excluding acquisitions and disposals. As such figures and comparisons presented on an organic basis exclude Swedish Match up until November 11, 2023. As mentioned previously, starting in the second quarter of 2022 and on a comparative basis, PMI excludes amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles from its adjusted results. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. I'm joined today by Jacek Olczak, Chief Executive Officer; and Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer. Over to you, Jacek.\nJacek Olczak: Thank you, James and welcome everyone. We had a remarkable year for our smoke-free transformation in 2022. Despite the exceptional challenges of the war in Ukraine, severe supply-chain disruptions and global inflation, we delivered very strong financial performance and took two major strategic strides towards a smoke-free future. I would like to express my deepest thanks to all my colleagues who spared no effort to drive excellent business results during these unprecedented times. Our thoughts also continue to be with those affected by the war in Ukraine and the recent tragedy in Turkey and Syria. In 2022, PMI delivered its second consecutive year of total volume growth, reflecting continued IQOS progress and broadly stable cigarette volumes. Full-year smoke-free net revenues reached almost one third of total PMI and over 50% in 17 markets. This is impressive progress towards our ambition of becoming a predominantly smoke-free company by net revenues in 2025. IQOS outstanding results continued with over 21% full-year growth in both shipment volumes and in market sales excluding Russia and Ukraine. This reflects broad-based momentum in the European Union Region, Japan and emerging markets. IQOS ILUMA continues to generate excellent growth in its launch markets with upgrades from existing users and new user acquisition outperforming our initial expectations. The success is supported by the increasing deployment of a two-tier heated tobacco units portfolio providing adult smokers with an expanding range of innovative and high quality alternatives to cigarettes. In combustibles, we delivered a robust performance with a 3.7% growth in organic net revenues and 0.3 percentage points higher share of segment excluding Russia and Ukraine despite the impact of adult smokers moving to smoke-free products. We also achieved two critical strategic milestones this year, reaching an agreement to take full control of IQOS in the U.S. in 2024 and successfully completing the acquisition of Swedish Match. These achievements will accelerate our smoke-free journey and further position us to lead the transformation of the wider industry. Clearly currency headwinds were extremely strong and weighed on our U.S.s dollar performance but although volatility remains, I am pleased that they seem to significantly abate in 2023. Overall, 2022 was a pivotal year and we look forward with confidence to 2023 and beyond. Let me now take a moment to cover our key strategic priorities for the coming year. With the acquisition of Swedish Match and securing the rights to IQOS in the U.S., we are now a global smoke-free champion. The addition of the world's biggest market and the leading nicotine pouch brand ZYN alongside IQOS provides us with significant untapped opportunities to further accelerate the growth of smoke-free products. As the strength of our IQOS business continues to grow rapidly, the full global rollout of IQOS ILUMA is a major priority and we expect to make substantial progress on this in 2023. The success of ILUMA in launch market so far demonstrates the importance of groundbreaking consumer-centric innovation and we continue to broaden our portfolio with new science backed offerings. This includes BONDS by IQOS, our latest heat-not-burn device aimed at low and middle-income adult smokers. Pilot city launches in Colombia and the Philippines in the last quarter of last year show encouraging early results and we intend to take the learnings from these markets before deploying on a wider scale. Following a successful first three years of partnership with KT&G, we also recently extended our long-term s their innovative smoke-free portfolio outside South Korea. I am very pleased to welcome Swedish Match to the PMI family. In particular, the fast-growing potential of ZYN is an incredibly exciting addition to our company. We are focused on supporting the Swedish Match team to continue and accelerate ZYN's outstanding success in the U.S. while also leveraging PMI commercial capabilities to prepare for the international expansion of nicotine pouches. IQOS and ZYN are premium brands, leading the global categories. In the U.S., ZYN is helping the American smokers leave cigarettes behind and offers great growth prospects. For IQOS, the world's biggest smoke-free market is a fully untapped opportunity and our plans are well underway in anticipation of our commercialization in the second-quarter of 2024. We will be leveraging the sales and distribution capabilities of Swedish Match and deploying our commercial model digital engine organization and infrastructure for a successful rollout. We continue to expect to file an FDA application for ILUMA in the second half of 2023. Logically, the international expansion of pouches, U.S. IQOS preparation and the replacement of IQOS 3 with ILUMA entail additional investments this year, which combined with inflationary pressures will weigh temporarily on our margins. Indeed, many of the ILUMA related costs are one-off in nature as Emmanuel will explain shortly. In combustibles, we continue to target a stable category share over time, despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization, while taking judicious pricing actions. As we have explained previously, maintaining our leadership in combustibles helps us maximize switching to smoke-free products through the connection to adult smokers and the retail trade. In terms of our financials, the strength of our business provides a robust operating cash flow, which we intend to maximize to provide reinvestment in our smoke-free business, deleveraging and growing the dividend. Finally and importantly, shaping tobacco harm reduction by providing better alternative to smokers and advocating for science-based regulation is critical to accelerate the end of smoking. Harm reduction is also at the core of our transformation, as we lead on sustainability to achieve a positive impact. We will be expanding on some of these topics at the CAGNY conference on February 22nd and we also plan to host an Investor Day in September this year, where we will go into greater detail on our strategies and future vision particularly with regard to --with regards to the U.S. Now, I will hand it over to Emmanuel, to discuss our results in 2023 and outlook in more detail.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Jacek. Our business driven by the strength of our innovative and expanding smoke-free portfolio generated excellent top and bottom-line 2022 growth despite a very difficult operating environment, and currency headwinds. Our full-year net revenues grew organically by plus 7.7% excluding Russia and Ukraine and by plus 7.1% for total PMI, despite the impact of hyper-inflationary accounting in Turkey. This reflect the continued strength of IQOS, accelerating pricing and the recovery of combustibles in many markets against a pandemic affected comparison, notably in H1. IQOS devices accounted for approximately 5% of our full-year smoke-free net revenue, both including and excluding Russia and Ukraine. Our net revenue per unit grew plus 4.4% organically, excluding Russia and Ukraine and by plus 5.5% in total. This was driven by combustible pricing of plus 4%, excluding Russia and Ukraine and plus 5% overall and the positive mix impact of an increasing proportion of HTUs heated tobacco unit in our overall volumes at higher net revenue per unit. Our 2022 operating income margin contracted organically by 60 basis-points, excluding Russia and Ukraine, and by 70 basis-points in total due to a number of headwinds, which I will come back to. These headwinds were partially mitigated by the growth of IQOS, pricing and ongoing cost-saving. In 2022, we delivered gross saving of $800 million, with over $1.6 billion in the first two years of our cost-efficiency program. This puts us well on track to exceed our target of $2 billion over 2021, 2023 and mitigate recent inflationary pressures. Despite margin pressures, our excellent top-line growth and diligent cost management enabled us to deliver currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 11.9% to $5.34, excluding Russia and Ukraine. This includes unfavorable currency of $0.85 and a small contribution from Swedish Match net of financing cost for the 50 days of consolidated results. For total PMI, we delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $5.98. We also had a strong finish to the year. We delivered excellent Q4 organic net revenue growth of plus 7.9%, excluding Russia and Ukraine. Again, reflecting continued strong IQOS performance and robust combustible pricing. Our Q4 operating income margin expanded organically by 80 basis-points, excluding Russia and Ukraine mainly due to a favorable comparison. On the total PMI basis, organic margin were flat including the impact of a challenging comparison in Ukraine and shipment timing in Russia. Fourth quarter currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS grew by plus 20.8% to $1.23, excluding Russia and Ukraine and plus 15.3% in total to $1.39, an excellent performance. Before discussing our 2023 guidance, I would like to provide an update on our Ukraine and Russia businesses. We continue to support our employees in Ukraine. I would like to personally thank them for their tremendous efforts to secure our business continuity during these extremely difficult times. In Russia, the environment for divestment has become increasingly challenging and complex, especially given recent December 2022 regulatory developments. To provide more clarity to investors on the full extent of our business, we will now include both Ukraine and Russia in our 2023 outlook and reporting. Now turning to the 2023 outlook, we expect to deliver very strong organic net revenue growth of plus 7% to plus 8.5%, supported by a step-up in combustible pricing and another year of rapid progress from IQOS. This would represent the third consecutive year of organic top-line growth above plus 7% and excludes the impact of Swedish Match for the large majority of the year. Including Swedish Match, we expect our reported currency-neutral net revenues to grow into the teens as its business continue to deliver strong performance. We expect excellent IQOS momentum to increase our HTU volume growth on the total PMI basis supported by the growing presence of ILUMA across our key markets. We forecast between 125 billion and 130 billion HTU shipment volumes, representing plus 15% to plus 19% growth. This reflects an acceleration compared to the total PMI growth rate in 2022 despite an expectation of no significant progress in Russia given our decision to restrict investment and innovation. As mentioned previously, the pace of ILUMA launches has also been constrained by supply-chain disruption and the outstanding take up in initial launch markets. We expect these constraint to gradually improve through the first half as we progressively roll-out to more geographies. We expect organic smoke-free net revenue growth to have an aligned progression with the rate of HTU volume growth this year with less distortion from device revenues. Including Swedish Match and at constant-currency, we expect to deliver around $13.5 billion in smoke-free net revenue compared to $10 billion in 2022 and to approach 40% of total PMI net revenues this year. While our topline outlook is very strong, like many other global companies, we are facing significant margin pressure from the intensifying inflationary environment in addition to a number of specific transitory factors and investment, which I will come back to shortly. As a result, we expect our adjusted operating income margin to contract between 50 to 150 basis-points organically. Accordingly, we forecast currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 7% to plus 9%. This includes a full year's positive contribution from Swedish Match net of the related interest expense. However, this benefit is offset by the increased interest cost on our non-Swedish Match debt and planned investments. This translate into an adjusted diluted EPS range of $6.25 to $6.37, including $0.15 of unfavorable currency at prevailing rates. This forecast notably, does not factor any potential favorable court ruling in Germany regarding the legality of the surcharge on the existing excise tax on heated tobacco product effective in Germany. as of 2022. We continue to account for the excise surcharge in our results and outlook. However, the obligation to pay the surcharge is currently suspended. If favorable the difference to our forecasted 2023 excise payment would increase our net revenue by around 1% and adjusted diluted EPS growth by around three point, thereby increasing our forecast currency-neutral growth range to plus 10% to plus 12%. In this scenario, we would expect our operating cash flow would move towards the upper half of our forecast range. We expect a judgment towards the end of the year. There are a number of other assumptions underpinning our outlook, we expect total international industry volumes of cigarettes and heated tobacco units excluding China and the U.S. to decline by minus 1% to minus 2%. Given our leadership in smoke-free product and the growth of the category, we expect to gain share and target total PMI shipment volume to be flat to plus 1%, which would represent the third consecutive year of growth. While we seek to maintain our share of the combustible category, given the current inflationary environment, we assume combustible pricing will accelerate to around plus 6% on an organic basis compared to the plus 5% realized in 2022. We also expect full-year capital expenditure of around $1.3 billion as compared to $1.1 billion in 2022, reflecting increased investment behind our smoke-free platform including ILUMA and Swedish Match portfolio. Let me now come back to the various factors impacting our margins. In 2022, total PMI gross margin contracted by 220 basis points organically. While growing inflationary pressures were a drag, the largest impact came from the combination of the rapid growth of ILUMA and transitory factors such as supply-chain disruption and the need to use air-freight. ILUMA drove accelerated device replacement from existing user in Japan and other launch market. Such devices sales are positive for acquisition, retention and full conversion. However, devices are margin-dilutive and this dynamic is likely to continue on a temporary basis, as we roll out to more markets this year and consumers upgrade from IQOS blade. The initially higher weight and cost of ILUMA consumable also played a role and this meant that the overall impact of our heat-not-burn business including devices was margin-dilutive in 2022. Importantly, average gross margin on HTUs remain around 10 percentage points higher than for cigarettes on the higher net revenue per unit. This is a fundamental long-term positive margin driver through the growing HTU volume mix in our business and this had a plus 110 basis-point favorable impact in 2022. Our two other key long-term margin drivers of pricing and productivities also continued to contribute favorably. Gross margin headwinds were mitigated at the operating income margin level by SG&A cost which declined by 150 basis-points of net revenues, due primarily to cost-efficiency, operating leverage and comparison effect. The picture for 2023 is quite different while our gross margin will face increased inflationary pressure, this is now primarily due to COGS for the cigarette business as leaf, acetate tow, salaries and energy cost increase. An acceleration in combustible pricing and lower air freight cost will serve to mitigate this exceptional inflation. However, a time lag is built into our projections. Importantly, while cost inflation is also headwind for IQOS, the 2023 margin impact of our heat-not-burn business is expected to be favorable due to the positive impact of increased HTU volume at higher net revenue per unit, planned ILUMA efficiencies and a more measured increase in device volumes. Overall, this underlying strength from IQOS combined with pricing will not be sufficient to offset combustible cost inflation in 2023, however, we expect a lower organic gross margin decline compared to last year and for our heat-not-burn business, to have an increasingly visible positive impact as we approach 2024. 2023 SG&A cost would include incremental investments to drive future growth, including in the commercialization of ILUMA. Also included is around $150 million with a broadly even split between the U.S., where we are preparing our organization capability for the launch of IQOS and wellness and healthcare investment in product development and clinical trials. In addition to inflation, this mean an SG&A cost increase more in line with net revenue growth is likely with limited margin impacts. A few words now on 2023 phasing. We expect margin pressures to be weighted to the first half, particularly given the challenging Q1 2022 comparison and a progressive decrease in airfreight cost throughout the year. In addition, investment are expected to be front loaded and we know that the rollout to ILUMA can lead to a short period of slower user acquisition as consumer wait for the launch. Combined with the timing of shipment and cost saving, we expect our 2023 top and bottom line delivery to be heavily H2 weighted. Indeed, we expect the first quarter to be the most challenging with low-single digit organic topline growth and soft margin. Shipment timing and ILUMA launch impact are expected to be pronounced and we accordingly expect HTU shipment volume of around 26 billion to 28 billion HTUs. We also face a comparison with a significantly lower impact from war related disruption. We forecast adjusted diluted EPS of $1.28 to $1.33, including $0.10 of unfavorable currency at prevailing rates. Importantly, we expect margin to improve as we approach 2024 as headwinds relent and the fundamental margin-accretive driver of our smoke-free transformation continue in the form of heated tobacco unit growth, pricing and cost optimization on ILUMA. Our cash flow generation remains strong. We delivered $10.8 billion in 2022 operating cash flows representing plus 3% growth on a currency-neutral basis. This include a favorable timing of certain financing item of around $0.3 billion. Given nonrecurring item and working capital movement benefited 2021 by around $1 billion, this was an excellent result. In 2023, we forecast $10 billion to $11 billion in operating cash-flow despite the notable expected impact from higher working capital requirements due to growth, global inflation and the reversal of one-off timing benefits. This put us on track to deliver our '21, '23 target of around $35 billion given in February 2021 at then prevailing rates. While our net debt is 2.9 times adjusted EBITDA on a 12 months trailing basis, this reflects only 50 days of Swedish Match results, including a full-year contribution for Swedish Match would clearly result in a lower ratio. We target robust EBITDA growth, which combined with strong cash flow allows us to focus on deleveraging, while continuing to invest in innovation and the growth of our business. In addition, our commitment to our progressive dividend policy is unwavering and in line with our long term commitment to return cash to shareholders. Turning back to our 2022 results, both our HTU and in-market sales volume increased by around 21.5% supporting total volume growth of plus 3.2%, excluding Russia and Ukraine. Q4 HTU shipment volume grew by plus 37.5%, partly reflecting the replenishment of inventory for ILUMA in Japan, following lower shipment earlier in the year and favorable shipment timing in the EU, notably in advance of new ILUMA launches. Supported by very solid cigarette performance, we delivered total volume growth for the second consecutive year, both including and excluding Russia and Ukraine. Focusing now on combustibles. Our portfolio delivered robust organic net revenue growth of plus 3.7% for the full-year excluding Russia and Ukraine. Combustible pricing increased in H2 as we continue to adjust to the inflationary environment. This resulted in Q4 organic pricing of plus 4.8%, excluding Russia and Ukraine and yielded full-year pricing in line with our expectation with notable contribution from Germany, the Philippines and Turkey, despite the impact of hyperinflationary accounting. In 2022, our share of the cigarette category increased by plus 0.3 percentage points excluding Russia and Ukraine following category share declines in 2020 and 2021, exacerbated by the pandemic. This includes sequential growth in every quarter of 2022. Marlboro remains extremely resilient despite pressure on disposable income and the impact of IQOS cannibalization with plus 0.2 percentage point share of segment growth. In addition, while we have not yet seen any meaningful acceleration in down trading, our share in the low price segment increased by plus 0.6 percentage points excluding Russia and Ukraine. As Jacek mentioned earlier, maintaining our leadership in the cigarette category is a key enabler in accelerating smokers switching to better alternative. Our robust cigarette share combined with the growth of IQOS delivered an overall market-share gain of plus 0.6 point in 2022, excluding Russia and Ukraine, with notable contribution from Egypt, Italy, Japan and Poland. PMI heated tobacco unit continue to strengthen the position towards becoming the largest nicotine brand in markets where IQOS is present and reached the number two position in 2022 with a record-high share of 8.5% in Q4. Now focusing on IQOS user growth, there were an estimated 20.3 million IQOS user as of December 31st, excluding Russia and Ukraine. This reflect growth of around plus 3.5 million for the full year. For total PMI, we estimate there were almost 25 million IQOS users as of year-end. Consistent with comments in our recent disclosures, user growth in October and November was slower due to higher-than-expected impact from commercial activity and lower acquisition for IQOS brand product in anticipation of the launch of ILUMA in certain key markets. However, we saw a strong rebound in December as ILUMA launches continued delivering robust user growth of plus $0.8 million for the quarter. This actually was close to our initial expectation and we look forward with confidence to 2023 as ILUMA continues to be deployed. ILUMA is driving volume and share growth across its market supporting our strong position in heat-not-burn category. We launched in eight new markets in Q4, including the Czech Republic, Italy, Portugal, and South Korea, bringing the total to 16 markets with ILUMA launched now represent more than half of our total HTU volume. ILUMA delivers a superior consumer experience as evidenced by net promoter scores which on average increased by more than 10 points across its different market archetypes and higher conversion rate compared to IQOS. While the rate of acceleration differ by market in both Switzerland and the more recently launched United Arab Emirates offtake share has almost doubled since launch. Importantly, as I mentioned earlier, the benefit of scale and optimization should allow us to bring down the cost of ILUMA overtime starting in the second half of 2023. Focusing now on the European Union where smoke-free net revenue exceeded 40% of the region for the full year. Our fourth quarter HTU share increased by plus 2.4 points to reach 8.8% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume with a modest flattering effect from timing factor. IMS volumes continue to grow sequentially and reached a record high of 9.3 billion units on the four-quarter moving average. This reflects success across many markets and key cities including Vilnius with over 43% share, as well as Athens and Rome with over 25%. In Japan the heat-not-burn category now represents close to 35% of total tobacco with IQOS increasingly driving its growth In Q4, the adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by plus 2.6 points to 24.5% with offtake share in Tokyo surpassing 30%. Our two-tier consumable portfolio continued to deliver strong results. IMS again grew sequentially to reach a record-high of 8.8 billion units on a four-quarter moving average as the number of Japanese IQOS users crossed a remarkable 7.5 million adult consumers. In addition to strong IQOS gain in developed countries, we continue to see very promising growth in low and middle-income market. In 2022, our HTU shipments grew by almost 50% excluding Russia and Ukraine. This robust performance reflects success across many markets, including Egypt where Urban Cairo exit offtake share surpassed 7% Bulgaria and Malaysia where Q4 offtake share reached 14% in both capital cities. Let's now move on to Swedish Match which finished the year strongly further confirming our belief that this combination will be accretive to our growth and margin profile over the coming years. Please note for housekeeping purposes, that my comments on Swedish Match Financial Results are based on publicly available information through September 30th and from November 11th when it was consolidated in PMI's financial statements. Swedish Match delivered excellent performance following the acquisition, with strong net revenue and adjusted operating income. Most impressive was the phenomenal U.S. growth of ZYN which I will come back to on the next slide. In other U.S. smoke-free products, moist snuff also performed well gaining almost one percentage point share of segment and growing 2022 volumes within a declining category. In Scandinavia, the overall smoke-free market and Swedish Match continued to grow, albeit helped by year end trade inventory movements ahead of a January excise tax increase in Sweden. The cigar business delivered robust performance to end a challenging year with growth in volume and category share. We are very pleased with the strong 2022 results from Swedish Match, which also included positive pricing across all smoke-free category. We look forward to reporting our combined results going forward. Now let's discuss ZYN's recent U.S. performance in more detail. Excellent progress continues with shipment volume growth of plus 37% in 2022 and plus 35% in Q4, reaching a record quarterly high. ZYN category volume share grew sequentially by one percentage point compared to the third quarter and by 2.2 percentage points compared to the prior year, further strengthening its position as the clear number one nicotine pouch brand despite continued heavy competitive discounting from less premium offerings. Importantly retail value share for ZYN remains strong at 75.7%, highlighting its premium positioning and high brand equity. 2023 promises to be a very exciting year. We are thrilled to have welcomed Swedish Match employee and leading oral nicotine portfolio into the PMI, family to create a global smoke-free champion. And we will look we will work together to create value as we accelerate towards our shared vision of the smoke-free future. In particular, bringing in ZYN and IQOS together in both the U.S. and international markets present a significant opportunity to drive accelerated growth and switching of adult smoker to better alternative. As a well-run and successful business we expect continued strong performance from Swedish Match existing operation. A key focus this year will be supporting and further driving strong in growth in the U.S. In addition, we are now preparing for the international expansion of nicotine pouches leveraging Swedish Match rich product portfolio and PMI's extensive smoke-free commercial infrastructure. In parallel, we will be actively Swedish Match U.S. distribution and commercial capabilities for the launch of IQOS in 2024. Moving to sustainability. As we transform our company our business and sustainability strategies are advancing hand-to-hand with increasing momentum. PMI and Swedish Match have a shared vision and values. The combination helps us further accelerate towards achieving our purpose, transforming for good to make cigarettes obsolete and maximize the benefit of smoke-free products. Our goal for best in class ESG performance is aligned as we seek to address the environmental impact of our product, eradicate child labor, reduce our carbon footprint and provide a more inclusive and empowered working environment for all our employees. In December, we published a standalone report detailing our new biodiversity and water ambitions. For biodiversity we aim to achieve no low net loss on ecosystem connected to our value chain by 2033 and contribute towards to a net positive impact on nature by 2050. For Water Stewardship we aim to scale solutions towards a positive impact on water resources by 2033 and contribute towards a positive impact on water resources by 2050. I am also proud to share that for the third consecutive year we have been awarded CDP's Triple A. CDP scored nearly 15,000 companies on their climate change forest and water security disclosures, of which only 12 received this strategic prestigious score. In addition I am excited to share that we are included in the 2023 Bloomberg GenderEquality Index for the third year running. I'll now turn back to Jacek for concluding remarks.\nJacek Olczak: Thank you, Emmanuel. Overall, our business delivered both a strong fourth quarter and full-year performance despite many challenging headwinds. We achieved excellent top and bottomline growth with double-digit currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth and almost $6 of adjusted EPS for total PMI. The consistent quality and sustainability of our organic top and bottomline delivery has been clearly demonstrated over the last three years. Most impressive was the continued outstanding performance of IQOS, which is now complemented by the remarkable growth of ZYN. Combined with Swedish Match we will have a comprehensive global smoke-free portfolio with leadership positions in heat-not-burn and the fastest-growing category of oral nicotine. We expect 2023 to be a landmark year for our smoke-free transformation with smoke-free net revenues of around $13.5 billion at constant currency, approaching 40% of our company. We have exciting opportunities for growing nicotine pouches in the U.S. and internationally, along with the U.S. commercialization of IQOS next year. We expect margin headwinds will persist in 2023 before improving in 2024. However, our underlying growth fundamentals remain strong and we look forward with - and we look forward with confidence. With an excellent performance over the past two years and our strong 2023 outlook, we expect to comfortably exceed our three year minimum CAGR targets of more than 5% organic net revenue growth, more than 9% in currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth and broadly stable shipment volumes. Finally, our strong growth outlook and highly cash-generative business enables us to deleverage while maintaining our steadfast commitment to our progressive dividend policy. Thank you for your attention, Emmanuel, and I will be happy now to answer your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Chris Growe with Stifel.\nChris Growe: Hi, good morning.\nJacek Olczak: Good morning, Chris.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Hi, Chris.\nChris Growe: Good morning. I want to ask you first of all, you gave some great color there and detail in your remarks. As I look at the EPS growth in 2023, just understand some of the burdens on that growth and we know about $150 million of investment you've outlined for the U.S. in your health and wellness division. What are the costs do you foresee in some of the supply-chain costs and use of air-freight available, how much are those burdening your cost for the year, if you can give some color on that?\nJacek Olczak: So maybe I start and Emmanuel will chip in, I guess. Yes, it's a 115 between the U.S., $115 million between the U.S. and the wellness healthcare, almost evenly spread between the two. Now, you have the air freight and this is more of the thing, which I think, we should start seeing some improvement in 2023 and especially as we go towards the second half of the year. I think, we should start normalize the use of the air freight, which will then obviously continue with the 2024. Now you have the inflationary pressure on the COGS, I think Emmanuel mentioned in his remarks, the leaf. Leaf, obviously is - due to our duration of inventories of the leaf and the way the leaf prices are rolling through the P&L is something which last usually longer right you have a three years above the duration of inventory. So, on a moving average, valuations I mean the spreads over the period of time you have energy, which is obviously the big hit across the number of directly or indirectly through the materials. Now we start seeing energy prices easing at least at this stage, but also you bind it by some contractual arrangements, et cetera. So I don't think that's helping '23, but I remain cautiously optimistic that as of '24, we should start seeing reversal of those. Obviously, you have a cost of the IQOS ILUMA roll out because we are at the year end, we've been at the 16 markets out of 73 markets total IQOS. So there is a bulk of a market in front of us in '23 and we don't want to stop or slow down the rollout of ILUMA. So obviously, you have a pressure on the margin coming from the extra sales of the devices, right, which obviously had a drag on the margins, and which essentially accelerating replacement of the devices at the existing consumers level, but with the very clear view now, that we have a very nice paper going forward with the accelerated acquisition, better consumption, better conversion rates. And that's the key items. So Emmanuel, did I miss something important.\nEmmanuel Babeau: No, I think you were very exhaustive clearly, Jacek. Just sort of couple of further detail and clearly, in '23, we've been flagging it. We expect our heat-not-burn business to contribute positively at the level of the gross margin rate evolution. So in '23 it's really inflation impacting us very negatively at the level of all cost of goods, but on combustible, we are going to increase price that is not going to be sufficient to offset this impact. And just to give you a color, Jacek was alluding to energy price. We're not talking about even the double-digit inflation, I mean energy price between '23 and '21 we are talking about close to a 3x factor. So it's a big increase with the big impact on the P&L. Over time with price increase, we're going to overcome that, but there is just a lag as we said on matching that. Then there is a big difference also on our SG&A cost evolution. In 2022, we were flat, because we've been generating a lot of efficiencies, inflation was not as others is going to be in '23 with a lot of salary increase and probably on the basis of comparison were more favorable. In '23, we expect to grow our SG&A in line with top-line, more or less which one would expect. We continue to invest a lot in order to support the growth of the business to acquire new user, digital investment. We talk about the U.S. and wellness and healthcare and there would still be efficiency, but not at the same level. Last element that I have to add, the cost of the debt, I'm not talking about the debt of acquisition of Swedish Match because for Swedish Match, we are in line with expectation i.e. low single-digit accretion on the EPS. But clearly for the existing debt, there is also an increase in the cost and that is having an impact on the evolution of the adjusted EPS. I think with that, Chris, we are giving all the information we can on what we are facing in term of evolution on our cost.\nChris Growe: That was sure exhaustive. Thank you for that. It was very, very helpful. I had just one quick follow-up, which will be that, you have heated tobacco unit growth expectation of that 15% to 19%. I just want to get an understanding on two specs of that, is Russia, Ukraine down likely in 2023, given you're not investing there. And then, just to what degree, its capacity limited today? If you had more ILUMA capacity, could that grow even faster? Thank you for your time.\nJacek Olczak: Okay, so actually the Russia and Ukraine and obviously, Russia due to its weight even more, there were drag on our performance both in '22 and will be - and it's fair to assume will be a drag in 2023. As you know is, our decision, strong decisions today investor and essentially ILUMA is for example, is the key technology advancements, which will have, which we decided not to rollout in Russia, because it has an impact right. So that, the numbers which we now just for the visibility to the investors of the business, as is today, we're including Russia and Ukraine but above five very much Russia not contributing to the growth. So one good thing opposite excluding Russia and Ukraine, our growth rates would be at a higher level, on a comparable level, capacity, we will. I think we have - we are guiding the market that we expect the better result in the second half of the year. And that's partially reflects the moment when we think, we will be beyond the bottleneck with regards to the capacity around ILUMA. So we really managing the business on a very tight supply chain for still this year, sorry 2022 and for first half of '23 and the second half of '23, we should be okay. I could actually - again - I can bridge back to the famous air freight, et cetera, because all of these things are consequences of us riding on a very, very tight supply chain.\nChris Growe: That makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: All right, thanks, hi.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Good morning, Bonnie.\nJacek Olczak: Hi Bonnie.\nBonnie Herzog: Good morning, I guess my question is on your op margin guidance and the implied deleverage. Maybe you could breakdown the headwinds you highlighted just a bit further and thinking about in the context of what you can control like the investments, you're making to drive future growth. Could you help frame that for us? Just trying to think through, how big of a step-up the investments will be this year versus last year? And then, how do we think about the investments required next year and beyond? I guess, I'm trying to get a sense of how much of the investments required to essentially roll-out IQOS in the U.S., it will take place this year versus next year. And I'm well aware of the investments you need to roll out ILUMA, but anything there would be helpful?\nEmmanuel Babeau: I'm please to take that one, Bonnie. So I think, on the U.S., we've been clear on the fact that we expect something like half of around $150 million, of course it's a rounding of extra investment in the U.S. as we prepare the launch of IQOS in the U.S. that is for 2023. When we have a plan for the coming years and of course, with more detail, we will of course come to you and elaborate and detail that. Now for the rest of the business, I think we are and that was the sense of my comment on SG&A evolution. On a relatively regular basis, we are investing an extra few $100 million in ILUMA to be more specific, because, of course, very sensitive information behind the acceleration of IQOS and it's going to come, of course, behind IQOS ILUMA in 2023. So the growth, when we say, we expect SG&A to grow broadly in line with topline, there is a huge impact of inflation. I mean, I don't need to explain that inflation is in most country around high single digit and we need to reflect that on salary increase. We have efficiency on cost in front of that and that is enabling us to on top of the inflation impact to keep investing on the growth of the business and we do that in a rather consistent manner, of course, very much focus behind ILUMA in 2023.\nBonnie Herzog: Okay, that's helpful. And then just a second question if I may, it's just related to the user growth in Q4 and IQOS, could you maybe talk through some of the puts and takes that you saw in the quarter. I mean, it seem to accelerate relative to Q3, despite some of the headwinds you had recently highlighted and then you did mention that ILUMA drives higher conversion rates than IQOS 3 DUO so, could you possibly quantify that for us? I guess, I'm trying to think through when that platform scales, do you expect your overall conversion to grow meaningfully possibly above your current 70% rate?\nJacek Olczak: Yes, so I maybe take the ILUMA conversion rates in the markets at this stage, [technical difficulty] run-rate conversion rates before an IQOS blade will be somewhere up in the range of a 10 percentage points. Okay, so obviously, different markets, there is some difference between the markets, but as a rule of thumb is about the 10 percentage point, which essentially means, the way we measure conversion at 10% of the devices sold through acquisition of new users, AG Snus and they should, and they are generating the recurring demand for the consumables. So this also has the - there's a better productivity on the user acquisitions and devices sold. I want to just bridge back to the - your previous question, Bonnie, if you allow me. When we look at the U.S. investment, we've highlighted, including the wellness and healthcare, about $150 million. But we shouldn't just look at the investment from the lenses of IQOS, because part of the investments, which we already started, once we committed to make this year, I believe will also benefit further growth opportunity for ZYN, okay, for Swedish Match. So it's not that we're really running business - two separate type of a businesses. We try to look at this from the leveraging and further enhancing the capabilities of Swedish Match and I believe the opportunities for ZYN in the U.S., they had a spectacular or phenomenal growth, depends which adjective you like better. But I think, there is more to come on this one. So the way we're looking at allocating the results is that, it is not just going to prepare us for the IQOS stake back in '24, but also in the meantime, can further - can be a further boost to the ZYN. Now, to your question also about the future rollout of the IQOS alone in the U.S., I think September when we meet, I hope during the Investors Day, we will be in a positions to give a more precise plan. So we obviously taking considerations the expected timelines vis a vis from FDA. We said that we're going to file IQOS ILUMA which is our - the best flagship and the best propositions we have today. And obviously, our objective - prime objective would be to enter markets, U.S. markets with a very big momentum coming from international on the best what we have, but I think, by September, this year, we should have more details and more visibility about this.\nBonnie Herzog: Okay, that's super helpful. I appreciate it.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Bonnie.\nJacek Olczak: Thank you, Bonnie.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Gaurav Jain with Barclays.\nGaurav Jain: Hi, good morning. So the first is on the step up in cigarette pricing, so it was 5% last years, you are saying it will be 6% in FY '23. Now Japan had 5% pricing last year, this year it will be 0, so clearly ex-Japan cigarette pricing is accelerating from four to seven approximately. So, where exactly is this biggest step-up happening in cigarette pricing?\nJacek Olczak: Japan, you pretty good single out Japan in this case, right, this is the biggest pricing from the unknow, right and it's difficult to make any assumptions in Japan, but we have already this year working pretty well with the good results on the - reversing the pricing trend in Indonesia. As you may recall, and I believe we're really turning the corner in Indonesia which always due to volume underlying size of the and the weight of the business to us is very important. I think, we have a stronger Philippines, plus the European markets also come with a strong pricing. So that 6%, which we assume in the - for this year is just the reflection of this. Now depends what's happened in Japan. I mean, all of these things will be coming on the top, but actually Japan from the large geographies is the under market when visibility for obvious reason is very limited to.\nGaurav Jain: Sure, thank you. And then on this EU heated tobacco flavor ban, which is expected to come later this year, how should we think about it? And how is it factored in your guidance?\nJacek Olczak: I mean, it's one of the events which nobody ever experienced. We have a - some sort of similarities with the flavor bans including menthol on the combustible cigarettes you may recall few years ago. And frankly speaking, that has not had any material sort of a impact on the cigarette volume, so I think here - okay we will see, what's going to happen. We think, it's going to be manageable.\nGaurav Jain: Sure, thank you so much.\nJacek Olczak: Thank you, Gaurav.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley.\nPamela Kaufman: Hi, good morning.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Hi Pams.\nJacek Olczak: Good morning, Pam.\nPamela Kaufman: Can you discuss your strategy for the U.S. market this year for Swedish Match and what you - what your key priorities are? And then what are your plans for the international rollout of ZYN and the timeline?\nJacek Olczak: So obviously, you know the focus is to continue and enhance the spectacular momentum of pouches, ZYN growth in the U.S. I mentioned this before answering another question that part of the investments we are allocating to U.S., I believe also will benefit the current business of Swedish Match. I think, there should be a bigger, better pricing, especially on the cigar business, although it is not really our strategic focus, but still obviously helps the overall business performance. And the strategy in terms of long-term, the big question obviously is how we will approach IQOS commercialization, the moment when we fully take it back in that in 2024. And we know what sort of actually capabilities are missing at the Swedish Match level. So we adding them. But the real big commercial spend, I mean, it will depend on the timing and the dense and the intensity of our rollout plans, which we will share, I guess, around September, during the Investors - September this year, around the Investors Day. When it comes to the pouches, on international, I think Swedish Match and us now together have a plans, how to start addressing some share pressure especially in the Nordics, okay but on the bigger international scale, we have quite a few markets, which we will start rolling out the pouches this year but for obvious reasons, I will not mention which markets. But that was the whole purpose of acquisition of Swedish Match, as you recall, leveraged the base and our growth opportunity in the U.S., is the - is a huge relief in a sense of preparedness for IQOS but also I believe the category has the - quite a potential in there or in the regions of this product space on international basis. We will have infrastructure in most of the markets, it's - I'm not releasing really - disclosing any strategic confidential matters, obviously IQOS is present in 70 plus markets. This is where the developed infrastructure is most developed and very likely, the markets for ZYN products will be - which in the list of this markets.\nPamela Kaufman: Thanks. And then can you just talk about your strategy with the bonds product that you launched in test markets and what your early observations are and then how are you thinking about a broader rollout over time?\nJacek Olczak: Yes. I mean it's a broader rollout of the bonds is more the - we've more strategically planned for the 2024, so the next year. We will have some volume, but nothing compared to be very frank to what we have about the IQOS and ILUMA product. This is by far the prime focus. But I think, the early results, which we get from the Philippines and Colombia, I mean, they are very strong, actually they are very strong, obviously our expectations after a seven or so years of experience with IQOS products are much higher than we ever had. So BONDS have to come and meet that expectations as well. The proposition essentially, we knew that the moment when we will be going more into the emerging markets, lower-income, when the afford - consumer affordability might be at a bottleneck in achieving our smoke-free ambitions. We had to also come up with a technology both on a consumables and on the device which somehow adjust the cost of the propositions to the potential pricing we can offer to the market. So obviously, the focus will be on the emerging markets, but I do believe that that proposition also nicely will help in some developed economies because across the spectrum of the smoker's audience, obviously, they also group of people who, for whom the affordability might create some constraint. So that will be a very nice complement - complementary propositions in our portfolio. And essentially it also help IQOS to continue on its extremely successful history of occupying this premium or medium plus space. This is - this mega brand, which we're trying to build, while preparing our self that one billion plus smokers in the world, I mean they are going across the different various price segments from the premium, mid, low, super-low et cetera and we need to provide the relevant propositions there. So I think, bonds is on the track and this is how we are going to play strategically in the portfolio.\nPamela Kaufman: Thank you. That's very helpful.\nJacek Olczak: Thank you, Pam. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Vivien Azer with Cowen.\nVivien Azer: Thank you, good morning.\nJacek Olczak: Hi Vivien\nVivien Azer: Hi. I was hoping to talk about the IQOS outlook, please, in terms of the stakes and in particular, what impact is the removal of characterizing flavors on HTUs in the EU, impacting your outlook. How are you accounting for that? And what's the expected timing of that, please. Thank you.\nJacek Olczak: Yes, so I partially answered that question before, Vivien. But the characterizing flavor, we had that - we had an experience with the cigarettes - combustible cigarettes in the past and it's the only reference point we might - we have today. And as you recall, the menthol and others ban in Europe, didn't really impact in any material way the volumes of the cigarette, so I think here, one can expect a similar sort of a manageable impact if you like of that ban. The second thing, it's very - but also reminding everyone that IQOS by far today is the best tobacco flavor proposition. Yes, there are some flavors, which we have in our portfolio, in the market , that propulsions might be different, but by far, IQOS on the pure tobacco flavor and this is by the way, were the bulk of the cigarette market, the rest in essentially all geographies. I mean this is an IQOS strength, so there was a portion of a portfolio, which will be impacted. But and I think for the vast majority of the smokers existing of sorry existing comparative to IQOS users and the smokers, which are still on a combustible, I mean IQOS still offers to date best in class taste and a flavor experience which is in the core of the tobacco flavor.\nVivien Azer: Thank you for that. And I apologize if I missed this, but is there any way that you can provide an update on kind of the infrastructure build-out for IQOS in the U.S. ahead of your reacquiring the commercial rights to that proposition, both in terms of the consumables as well as the devices? Thank you.\nJacek Olczak: Yes. I think there was look - there was a - we're looking also both as a - we are also looking at this, not only on IQOS on a standard basis but IQOS and the ZYN and other parts of the Swedish Match business. And I believe, the obvious, the questions of the optimal distribution and I believe this can pair very well and enhancements already to the distribution which serves not only in a future IQOS but can and will serve actually in growth opportunities today, there is the whole digital aspect, there is a better management of the pricing promotions. The whole consumer piece, right, which is so strong behind an IQOS success. I mean, that's something which we are preparing the infrastructure for.\nVivien Azer: Okay, thank you.\nJacek Olczak: Thank you, Vivien.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Owen Bennett with Jefferies.\nOwen Bennett: Afternoon, gents. Hope you all well.\nJacek Olczak: Good afternoon, Owen.\nOwen Bennett: Yes my question is more a bigger picture, longer term, one around the U.S. and the overall RRP space, now you've got control of your own destiny. I was hoping to get your thoughts on how you see RRP overall develop longer-term across the different categories? Whether you see some more attractive than all these. And do you still think you could envisage or when we introduce into the U.S., obviously bearing in mind, the limited traction it got with Altria, and then just linked to these U.S. RRP plans, any update on timing for a PMTA submission with your VEEV product. Thank you.\nJacek Olczak: Yes, so I start with the last one. We plan to submit the IQOS ILUMA to PMTA to FDA in the second half of this year. Now with regards to the - to potential, look, we think that an IQOS strength, which is really if you go to the core of the smokers today, when they really enjoy this pure unaffected by any flavors et cetera, tobacco flavor and so on is undisputed. Every market you go, IQOS exactly delivers on the flavor, taste expectations to this audience. And that's also I believe a critical factor in IQOS high conversion rate. And how many people fully adopt the IQOS and not only that they are leaving cigarettes fully behind them, they don't even attempt it on occasional basis to go back to cigarettes, okay, so that's the core and I believe for the audience which with the smoking audience, which you have in the U.S., IQOS perfectly fitting into this whole thing obviously the other platforms, which offer you the different ritual, different experience, the e-cigarettes and the pouches. The e-cigarettes usually more driven by the flavors, and obviously absence the pure tobacco natural type of a flavor, it's - that's the challenge, which partially in our opinion is behind more of the dual consumption that the full conversion, but also the products are under development and they're getting better. And pouch is actually on the risk continuum of the product. I mean, it's an average important offering for the consumers, who really want to reduce significantly exposure and potentially the harm by - while enjoying the product. So I think, there is this complementary, there is this complementary role of each of these platforms with, you know, also that we're working on our platform forward because technically which is Leaf and the Viva products, the electronic cigarette segments going through this own dynamics, is this mix of the flavors, disposable et cetera, it's not necessarily great for the economics, but partially also because of the slower conversion rate compared to the other platforms. So we have said it from the very beginning of our transformation, if you follow us seven, eight years ago, I recall that the - one of the first investors conferences, when we announced the purpose of that we want to go smoke free, we have said that there is the room for every platform at the different moments for different consumers and our job is at the right time to deploy this platforms and the leverage, the opportunities and the benefit to the smokers.\nOwen Bennett: Great, fantastic. And just - sorry, a follow-up, the question on the PMTA was not for ILUMA, I think previously for VEEV you said, you targeted first half of '23, just any update on VEEV, PMTA submission?.\nJacek Olczak: Yes as I think, we're also thinking about the 2023, but now having also the ZYN and knowing what ILUMA can do and knowing that before we also need to make sure that we have a right PMTA submission strategy, right, it was an effort behind each of them and we need to prioritize, but the - I mean the way we are thinking, we are - sorry thinking, is more than a thinking, we are working on bringing our P4 to the U.S. as well.\nOwen Bennett: Great, thanks guys, appreciate it.\nJacek Olczak: Thank you, Owen.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Andrei Condrea with UBS.\nAndrei Condrea: Hi everyone, thank you for taking my question, just one from me.\nJacek Olczak: Hi Andrei.\nAndrei Condrea: Sticking to \u2013 hi, sticking to U.S. IQOS. We know that the U.S. menthol ban from the FDA proposed standards allows - potentially will allow for some exceptions to it. And thinking that your IQOS has the MRTP designation, which is rather unique versus all its peers, would -- were you factoring this in when you set out your ambition of I believe 10% market share by 2030 if I'm not mistaken?\nJacek Olczak: Yes, you were - I think you're quoting my words, this is Jacek here. Yes, I still do believe that IQOS by 2030 knowing how it performs on the many other international markets. The 10% is not out of - it can be a realistic ambitious - ambition or realistic dream. Now to be very frank, when we look into this, we have not been trying to factor being that there might be some flavors or menthol bans on other products. But you rightly noticed that IQOS today is two variants of IQOS outdoor iced with the menthol flavor, will this be an accelerating factor or not? Look I mean the future will tell, but I still believe that IQOS as is in the current environment due to its strength and the satisfaction it gives to smokers, et cetera has the - that big potential in from the person.\nAndrei Condrea: I see very clear. Thank you.\nJacek Olczak: Thank you, Andrei.\nOperator: We'll take our last question from Jared Dinges with JPMorgan.\nJared Dinges: Yes, thanks. Hi, guys.\nJacek Olczak: Thank you, hi.\nJared Dinges: A couple from me please, first, given the CapEx, step-up in CapEx that you expect for this year, I just wanted to ask, how should we be thinking about CapEx levels beyond '23? Is next year kind of a one off given the ZYN international expansion plans?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Look I think, you should expect us of course to accompany the growth we are growing volume within more capacities, so the CapEx will reflect that. There is certainly, when it comes to ILUMA, a moment where we build the capacity for ILUMA and that is translating into a significant investment. So you see that in the 1.3. I would say, we are going to certainly regularly invest on the capacity for the Swedish Match overall business, so I'm not able to get at that stage. I'm not giving guidance on '24. I certainly believe that there is this transition moment where we are building the capacity on ILUMA then of course that will be accompanying the growth of ILUMA and - and we are very ambitious, as you know, on growing overall product. So that will come with investment, but, of course, they are not of the same magnitude as the one that we've been making in order to be the capacity on IQOS, smaller volume, smaller base. So notwithstanding back on the long-term anyway.\nJared Dinges: Okay, that's clear. And for the second one and maybe just on the Healthcare and Wellness segment, I mean, 2023 will be another investment year. I know you guys have talked about that that probably being a multiyear investment cycle. But I don't know if you can give any indication on when you think that business could potentially start to contribute to growth and maybe also, could you guys talk about your learnings so far in those businesses that you have acquired?\nJacek Olczak: Yes I mean, look, they obviously, been very clear about this from the very beginning, I mean, in order to develop and bring to the market of a couple of the programs and products, which we have it in mind, I mean we have to go for the investments, we talked about us prefer also have a very promising investment in the medical of - in the medical space be cannabinoids et cetera. So all of this programs that they agree to establish milestones in terms of the - the development of these products including the series of clinicals and meeting of different regulatory expectation, so that's about what's going to be. We have said historically our ambitious target of achieving this $1 billion revenue by 2025, there is a pipeline of the product but the more interesting actually, what's going to happen with that business beyond '25, because it's the longer-term, longer-term investment. Obviously, when we allocate the capital, we look first with - we allocate the capital behind the -- those things, which are in the near and mid-term for us and it's obviously heat-not-burn and IQOS, ILUMA expansions to the US, and I can go through the long list of an opportunities but they're keeping also denied. This businesses have a quite - wellness and healthcare offers us a very interesting opportunities in the longer run, when we very well leverage both our scientific life science expertise capabilities combined with the commercial et cetera. So, this is how I would look on this thing. I think when we meet on the - in September of this year for the Investors Day, we will start, obviously opening a much more longer-term horizon, how the management, how we see the future of PMI not just in the next year or two, but with the longer time of a perspective. And this is the moment when, I guess, we will share more details, by the way, also I think we'll be able to answer more precisely your first questions to Emmanuel, about the CapEx, because obviously, we open a 10 years horizon for Philip Morris, we will have to touch upon that capital allocation component as well.\nJared Dinges: Great, that's helpful. Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nJacek Olczak: Thank you.\nOperator: It appears, we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the program back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.\nJames Bushnell: Thank you. Before closing our call, I would like to remind you that we will be presenting at the CAGNY conference on February 22. And as we mentioned earlier, we plan to host the September Investor Day, in Switzerland. We hope, you will be able to join these events, either in person or virtually. That concludes our call today. Thank you again for joining us. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations team. Thank you.\nJacek Olczak: Thank you. Talk to you soon.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jacek Olczak",
            "content": "Thank you, James and welcome everyone. We had a remarkable year for our smoke-free transformation in 2022. Despite the exceptional challenges of the war in Ukraine, severe supply-chain disruptions and global inflation, we delivered very strong financial performance and took two major strategic strides towards a smoke-free future. I would like to express my deepest thanks to all my colleagues who spared no effort to drive excellent business results during these unprecedented times. Our thoughts also continue to be with those affected by the war in Ukraine and the recent tragedy in Turkey and Syria. In 2022, PMI delivered its second consecutive year of total volume growth, reflecting continued IQOS progress and broadly stable cigarette volumes. Full-year smoke-free net revenues reached almost one third of total PMI and over 50% in 17 markets. This is impressive progress towards our ambition of becoming a predominantly smoke-free company by net revenues in 2025. IQOS outstanding results continued with over 21% full-year growth in both shipment volumes and in market sales excluding Russia and Ukraine. This reflects broad-based momentum in the European Union Region, Japan and emerging markets. IQOS ILUMA continues to generate excellent growth in its launch markets with upgrades from existing users and new user acquisition outperforming our initial expectations. The success is supported by the increasing deployment of a two-tier heated tobacco units portfolio providing adult smokers with an expanding range of innovative and high quality alternatives to cigarettes. In combustibles, we delivered a robust performance with a 3.7% growth in organic net revenues and 0.3 percentage points higher share of segment excluding Russia and Ukraine despite the impact of adult smokers moving to smoke-free products. We also achieved two critical strategic milestones this year, reaching an agreement to take full control of IQOS in the U.S. in 2024 and successfully completing the acquisition of Swedish Match. These achievements will accelerate our smoke-free journey and further position us to lead the transformation of the wider industry. Clearly currency headwinds were extremely strong and weighed on our U.S.s dollar performance but although volatility remains, I am pleased that they seem to significantly abate in 2023. Overall, 2022 was a pivotal year and we look forward with confidence to 2023 and beyond. Let me now take a moment to cover our key strategic priorities for the coming year. With the acquisition of Swedish Match and securing the rights to IQOS in the U.S., we are now a global smoke-free champion. The addition of the world's biggest market and the leading nicotine pouch brand ZYN alongside IQOS provides us with significant untapped opportunities to further accelerate the growth of smoke-free products. As the strength of our IQOS business continues to grow rapidly, the full global rollout of IQOS ILUMA is a major priority and we expect to make substantial progress on this in 2023. The success of ILUMA in launch market so far demonstrates the importance of groundbreaking consumer-centric innovation and we continue to broaden our portfolio with new science backed offerings. This includes BONDS by IQOS, our latest heat-not-burn device aimed at low and middle-income adult smokers. Pilot city launches in Colombia and the Philippines in the last quarter of last year show encouraging early results and we intend to take the learnings from these markets before deploying on a wider scale. Following a successful first three years of partnership with KT&G, we also recently extended our long-term s their innovative smoke-free portfolio outside South Korea. I am very pleased to welcome Swedish Match to the PMI family. In particular, the fast-growing potential of ZYN is an incredibly exciting addition to our company. We are focused on supporting the Swedish Match team to continue and accelerate ZYN's outstanding success in the U.S. while also leveraging PMI commercial capabilities to prepare for the international expansion of nicotine pouches. IQOS and ZYN are premium brands, leading the global categories. In the U.S., ZYN is helping the American smokers leave cigarettes behind and offers great growth prospects. For IQOS, the world's biggest smoke-free market is a fully untapped opportunity and our plans are well underway in anticipation of our commercialization in the second-quarter of 2024. We will be leveraging the sales and distribution capabilities of Swedish Match and deploying our commercial model digital engine organization and infrastructure for a successful rollout. We continue to expect to file an FDA application for ILUMA in the second half of 2023. Logically, the international expansion of pouches, U.S. IQOS preparation and the replacement of IQOS 3 with ILUMA entail additional investments this year, which combined with inflationary pressures will weigh temporarily on our margins. Indeed, many of the ILUMA related costs are one-off in nature as Emmanuel will explain shortly. In combustibles, we continue to target a stable category share over time, despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization, while taking judicious pricing actions. As we have explained previously, maintaining our leadership in combustibles helps us maximize switching to smoke-free products through the connection to adult smokers and the retail trade. In terms of our financials, the strength of our business provides a robust operating cash flow, which we intend to maximize to provide reinvestment in our smoke-free business, deleveraging and growing the dividend. Finally and importantly, shaping tobacco harm reduction by providing better alternative to smokers and advocating for science-based regulation is critical to accelerate the end of smoking. Harm reduction is also at the core of our transformation, as we lead on sustainability to achieve a positive impact. We will be expanding on some of these topics at the CAGNY conference on February 22nd and we also plan to host an Investor Day in September this year, where we will go into greater detail on our strategies and future vision particularly with regard to --with regards to the U.S. Now, I will hand it over to Emmanuel, to discuss our results in 2023 and outlook in more detail. Thank you, Emmanuel. Overall, our business delivered both a strong fourth quarter and full-year performance despite many challenging headwinds. We achieved excellent top and bottomline growth with double-digit currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth and almost $6 of adjusted EPS for total PMI. The consistent quality and sustainability of our organic top and bottomline delivery has been clearly demonstrated over the last three years. Most impressive was the continued outstanding performance of IQOS, which is now complemented by the remarkable growth of ZYN. Combined with Swedish Match we will have a comprehensive global smoke-free portfolio with leadership positions in heat-not-burn and the fastest-growing category of oral nicotine. We expect 2023 to be a landmark year for our smoke-free transformation with smoke-free net revenues of around $13.5 billion at constant currency, approaching 40% of our company. We have exciting opportunities for growing nicotine pouches in the U.S. and internationally, along with the U.S. commercialization of IQOS next year. We expect margin headwinds will persist in 2023 before improving in 2024. However, our underlying growth fundamentals remain strong and we look forward with - and we look forward with confidence. With an excellent performance over the past two years and our strong 2023 outlook, we expect to comfortably exceed our three year minimum CAGR targets of more than 5% organic net revenue growth, more than 9% in currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth and broadly stable shipment volumes. Finally, our strong growth outlook and highly cash-generative business enables us to deleverage while maintaining our steadfast commitment to our progressive dividend policy. Thank you for your attention, Emmanuel, and I will be happy now to answer your questions. Good morning, Chris. So maybe I start and Emmanuel will chip in, I guess. Yes, it's a 115 between the U.S., $115 million between the U.S. and the wellness healthcare, almost evenly spread between the two. Now, you have the air freight and this is more of the thing, which I think, we should start seeing some improvement in 2023 and especially as we go towards the second half of the year. I think, we should start normalize the use of the air freight, which will then obviously continue with the 2024. Now you have the inflationary pressure on the COGS, I think Emmanuel mentioned in his remarks, the leaf. Leaf, obviously is - due to our duration of inventories of the leaf and the way the leaf prices are rolling through the P&L is something which last usually longer right you have a three years above the duration of inventory. So, on a moving average, valuations I mean the spreads over the period of time you have energy, which is obviously the big hit across the number of directly or indirectly through the materials. Now we start seeing energy prices easing at least at this stage, but also you bind it by some contractual arrangements, et cetera. So I don't think that's helping '23, but I remain cautiously optimistic that as of '24, we should start seeing reversal of those. Obviously, you have a cost of the IQOS ILUMA roll out because we are at the year end, we've been at the 16 markets out of 73 markets total IQOS. So there is a bulk of a market in front of us in '23 and we don't want to stop or slow down the rollout of ILUMA. So obviously, you have a pressure on the margin coming from the extra sales of the devices, right, which obviously had a drag on the margins, and which essentially accelerating replacement of the devices at the existing consumers level, but with the very clear view now, that we have a very nice paper going forward with the accelerated acquisition, better consumption, better conversion rates. And that's the key items. So Emmanuel, did I miss something important. Okay, so actually the Russia and Ukraine and obviously, Russia due to its weight even more, there were drag on our performance both in '22 and will be - and it's fair to assume will be a drag in 2023. As you know is, our decision, strong decisions today investor and essentially ILUMA is for example, is the key technology advancements, which will have, which we decided not to rollout in Russia, because it has an impact right. So that, the numbers which we now just for the visibility to the investors of the business, as is today, we're including Russia and Ukraine but above five very much Russia not contributing to the growth. So one good thing opposite excluding Russia and Ukraine, our growth rates would be at a higher level, on a comparable level, capacity, we will. I think we have - we are guiding the market that we expect the better result in the second half of the year. And that's partially reflects the moment when we think, we will be beyond the bottleneck with regards to the capacity around ILUMA. So we really managing the business on a very tight supply chain for still this year, sorry 2022 and for first half of '23 and the second half of '23, we should be okay. I could actually - again - I can bridge back to the famous air freight, et cetera, because all of these things are consequences of us riding on a very, very tight supply chain. Hi Bonnie. Yes, so I maybe take the ILUMA conversion rates in the markets at this stage, [technical difficulty] run-rate conversion rates before an IQOS blade will be somewhere up in the range of a 10 percentage points. Okay, so obviously, different markets, there is some difference between the markets, but as a rule of thumb is about the 10 percentage point, which essentially means, the way we measure conversion at 10% of the devices sold through acquisition of new users, AG Snus and they should, and they are generating the recurring demand for the consumables. So this also has the - there's a better productivity on the user acquisitions and devices sold. I want to just bridge back to the - your previous question, Bonnie, if you allow me. When we look at the U.S. investment, we've highlighted, including the wellness and healthcare, about $150 million. But we shouldn't just look at the investment from the lenses of IQOS, because part of the investments, which we already started, once we committed to make this year, I believe will also benefit further growth opportunity for ZYN, okay, for Swedish Match. So it's not that we're really running business - two separate type of a businesses. We try to look at this from the leveraging and further enhancing the capabilities of Swedish Match and I believe the opportunities for ZYN in the U.S., they had a spectacular or phenomenal growth, depends which adjective you like better. But I think, there is more to come on this one. So the way we're looking at allocating the results is that, it is not just going to prepare us for the IQOS stake back in '24, but also in the meantime, can further - can be a further boost to the ZYN. Now, to your question also about the future rollout of the IQOS alone in the U.S., I think September when we meet, I hope during the Investors Day, we will be in a positions to give a more precise plan. So we obviously taking considerations the expected timelines vis a vis from FDA. We said that we're going to file IQOS ILUMA which is our - the best flagship and the best propositions we have today. And obviously, our objective - prime objective would be to enter markets, U.S. markets with a very big momentum coming from international on the best what we have, but I think, by September, this year, we should have more details and more visibility about this. Thank you, Bonnie. Japan, you pretty good single out Japan in this case, right, this is the biggest pricing from the unknow, right and it's difficult to make any assumptions in Japan, but we have already this year working pretty well with the good results on the - reversing the pricing trend in Indonesia. As you may recall, and I believe we're really turning the corner in Indonesia which always due to volume underlying size of the and the weight of the business to us is very important. I think, we have a stronger Philippines, plus the European markets also come with a strong pricing. So that 6%, which we assume in the - for this year is just the reflection of this. Now depends what's happened in Japan. I mean, all of these things will be coming on the top, but actually Japan from the large geographies is the under market when visibility for obvious reason is very limited to. I mean, it's one of the events which nobody ever experienced. We have a - some sort of similarities with the flavor bans including menthol on the combustible cigarettes you may recall few years ago. And frankly speaking, that has not had any material sort of a impact on the cigarette volume, so I think here - okay we will see, what's going to happen. We think, it's going to be manageable. Thank you, Gaurav. Good morning, Pam. So obviously, you know the focus is to continue and enhance the spectacular momentum of pouches, ZYN growth in the U.S. I mentioned this before answering another question that part of the investments we are allocating to U.S., I believe also will benefit the current business of Swedish Match. I think, there should be a bigger, better pricing, especially on the cigar business, although it is not really our strategic focus, but still obviously helps the overall business performance. And the strategy in terms of long-term, the big question obviously is how we will approach IQOS commercialization, the moment when we fully take it back in that in 2024. And we know what sort of actually capabilities are missing at the Swedish Match level. So we adding them. But the real big commercial spend, I mean, it will depend on the timing and the dense and the intensity of our rollout plans, which we will share, I guess, around September, during the Investors - September this year, around the Investors Day. When it comes to the pouches, on international, I think Swedish Match and us now together have a plans, how to start addressing some share pressure especially in the Nordics, okay but on the bigger international scale, we have quite a few markets, which we will start rolling out the pouches this year but for obvious reasons, I will not mention which markets. But that was the whole purpose of acquisition of Swedish Match, as you recall, leveraged the base and our growth opportunity in the U.S., is the - is a huge relief in a sense of preparedness for IQOS but also I believe the category has the - quite a potential in there or in the regions of this product space on international basis. We will have infrastructure in most of the markets, it's - I'm not releasing really - disclosing any strategic confidential matters, obviously IQOS is present in 70 plus markets. This is where the developed infrastructure is most developed and very likely, the markets for ZYN products will be - which in the list of this markets. Yes. I mean it's a broader rollout of the bonds is more the - we've more strategically planned for the 2024, so the next year. We will have some volume, but nothing compared to be very frank to what we have about the IQOS and ILUMA product. This is by far the prime focus. But I think, the early results, which we get from the Philippines and Colombia, I mean, they are very strong, actually they are very strong, obviously our expectations after a seven or so years of experience with IQOS products are much higher than we ever had. So BONDS have to come and meet that expectations as well. The proposition essentially, we knew that the moment when we will be going more into the emerging markets, lower-income, when the afford - consumer affordability might be at a bottleneck in achieving our smoke-free ambitions. We had to also come up with a technology both on a consumables and on the device which somehow adjust the cost of the propositions to the potential pricing we can offer to the market. So obviously, the focus will be on the emerging markets, but I do believe that that proposition also nicely will help in some developed economies because across the spectrum of the smoker's audience, obviously, they also group of people who, for whom the affordability might create some constraint. So that will be a very nice complement - complementary propositions in our portfolio. And essentially it also help IQOS to continue on its extremely successful history of occupying this premium or medium plus space. This is - this mega brand, which we're trying to build, while preparing our self that one billion plus smokers in the world, I mean they are going across the different various price segments from the premium, mid, low, super-low et cetera and we need to provide the relevant propositions there. So I think, bonds is on the track and this is how we are going to play strategically in the portfolio. Thank you, Pam. Thank you. Hi Vivien Yes, so I partially answered that question before, Vivien. But the characterizing flavor, we had that - we had an experience with the cigarettes - combustible cigarettes in the past and it's the only reference point we might - we have today. And as you recall, the menthol and others ban in Europe, didn't really impact in any material way the volumes of the cigarette, so I think here, one can expect a similar sort of a manageable impact if you like of that ban. The second thing, it's very - but also reminding everyone that IQOS by far today is the best tobacco flavor proposition. Yes, there are some flavors, which we have in our portfolio, in the market , that propulsions might be different, but by far, IQOS on the pure tobacco flavor and this is by the way, were the bulk of the cigarette market, the rest in essentially all geographies. I mean this is an IQOS strength, so there was a portion of a portfolio, which will be impacted. But and I think for the vast majority of the smokers existing of sorry existing comparative to IQOS users and the smokers, which are still on a combustible, I mean IQOS still offers to date best in class taste and a flavor experience which is in the core of the tobacco flavor. Yes. I think there was look - there was a - we're looking also both as a - we are also looking at this, not only on IQOS on a standard basis but IQOS and the ZYN and other parts of the Swedish Match business. And I believe, the obvious, the questions of the optimal distribution and I believe this can pair very well and enhancements already to the distribution which serves not only in a future IQOS but can and will serve actually in growth opportunities today, there is the whole digital aspect, there is a better management of the pricing promotions. The whole consumer piece, right, which is so strong behind an IQOS success. I mean, that's something which we are preparing the infrastructure for. Thank you, Vivien. Good afternoon, Owen. Yes, so I start with the last one. We plan to submit the IQOS ILUMA to PMTA to FDA in the second half of this year. Now with regards to the - to potential, look, we think that an IQOS strength, which is really if you go to the core of the smokers today, when they really enjoy this pure unaffected by any flavors et cetera, tobacco flavor and so on is undisputed. Every market you go, IQOS exactly delivers on the flavor, taste expectations to this audience. And that's also I believe a critical factor in IQOS high conversion rate. And how many people fully adopt the IQOS and not only that they are leaving cigarettes fully behind them, they don't even attempt it on occasional basis to go back to cigarettes, okay, so that's the core and I believe for the audience which with the smoking audience, which you have in the U.S., IQOS perfectly fitting into this whole thing obviously the other platforms, which offer you the different ritual, different experience, the e-cigarettes and the pouches. The e-cigarettes usually more driven by the flavors, and obviously absence the pure tobacco natural type of a flavor, it's - that's the challenge, which partially in our opinion is behind more of the dual consumption that the full conversion, but also the products are under development and they're getting better. And pouch is actually on the risk continuum of the product. I mean, it's an average important offering for the consumers, who really want to reduce significantly exposure and potentially the harm by - while enjoying the product. So I think, there is this complementary, there is this complementary role of each of these platforms with, you know, also that we're working on our platform forward because technically which is Leaf and the Viva products, the electronic cigarette segments going through this own dynamics, is this mix of the flavors, disposable et cetera, it's not necessarily great for the economics, but partially also because of the slower conversion rate compared to the other platforms. So we have said it from the very beginning of our transformation, if you follow us seven, eight years ago, I recall that the - one of the first investors conferences, when we announced the purpose of that we want to go smoke free, we have said that there is the room for every platform at the different moments for different consumers and our job is at the right time to deploy this platforms and the leverage, the opportunities and the benefit to the smokers. Yes as I think, we're also thinking about the 2023, but now having also the ZYN and knowing what ILUMA can do and knowing that before we also need to make sure that we have a right PMTA submission strategy, right, it was an effort behind each of them and we need to prioritize, but the - I mean the way we are thinking, we are - sorry thinking, is more than a thinking, we are working on bringing our P4 to the U.S. as well. Thank you, Owen. Hi Andrei. Yes, you were - I think you're quoting my words, this is Jacek here. Yes, I still do believe that IQOS by 2030 knowing how it performs on the many other international markets. The 10% is not out of - it can be a realistic ambitious - ambition or realistic dream. Now to be very frank, when we look into this, we have not been trying to factor being that there might be some flavors or menthol bans on other products. But you rightly noticed that IQOS today is two variants of IQOS outdoor iced with the menthol flavor, will this be an accelerating factor or not? Look I mean the future will tell, but I still believe that IQOS as is in the current environment due to its strength and the satisfaction it gives to smokers, et cetera has the - that big potential in from the person. Thank you, Andrei. Thank you, hi. Yes I mean, look, they obviously, been very clear about this from the very beginning, I mean, in order to develop and bring to the market of a couple of the programs and products, which we have it in mind, I mean we have to go for the investments, we talked about us prefer also have a very promising investment in the medical of - in the medical space be cannabinoids et cetera. So all of this programs that they agree to establish milestones in terms of the - the development of these products including the series of clinicals and meeting of different regulatory expectation, so that's about what's going to be. We have said historically our ambitious target of achieving this $1 billion revenue by 2025, there is a pipeline of the product but the more interesting actually, what's going to happen with that business beyond '25, because it's the longer-term, longer-term investment. Obviously, when we allocate the capital, we look first with - we allocate the capital behind the -- those things, which are in the near and mid-term for us and it's obviously heat-not-burn and IQOS, ILUMA expansions to the US, and I can go through the long list of an opportunities but they're keeping also denied. This businesses have a quite - wellness and healthcare offers us a very interesting opportunities in the longer run, when we very well leverage both our scientific life science expertise capabilities combined with the commercial et cetera. So, this is how I would look on this thing. I think when we meet on the - in September of this year for the Investors Day, we will start, obviously opening a much more longer-term horizon, how the management, how we see the future of PMI not just in the next year or two, but with the longer time of a perspective. And this is the moment when, I guess, we will share more details, by the way, also I think we'll be able to answer more precisely your first questions to Emmanuel, about the CapEx, because obviously, we open a 10 years horizon for Philip Morris, we will have to touch upon that capital allocation component as well. Thank you. Thank you. Talk to you soon."

Our business driven by the strength of our innovative and expanding smoke-free portfolio generated excellent top and bottom-line 2022 growth despite a very difficult operating environment, and currency headwinds. Our full-year net revenues grew organically by plus 7.7% excluding Russia and Ukraine and by plus 7.1% for total PMI, despite the impact of hyper-inflationary accounting in Turkey. This reflect the continued strength of IQOS, accelerating pricing and the recovery of combustibles in many markets against a pandemic affected comparison, notably in H1. IQOS devices accounted for approximately 5% of our full-year smoke-free net revenue, both including and excluding Russia and Ukraine. Our net revenue per unit grew plus 4.4% organically, excluding Russia and Ukraine and by plus 5.5% in total. This was driven by combustible pricing of plus 4%, excluding Russia and Ukraine and plus 5% overall and the positive mix impact of an increasing proportion of HTUs heated tobacco unit in our overall volumes at higher net revenue per unit. Our 2022 operating income margin contracted organically by 60 basis-points, excluding Russia and Ukraine, and by 70 basis-points in total due to a number of headwinds, which I will come back to. These headwinds were partially mitigated by the growth of IQOS, pricing and ongoing cost-saving. In 2022, we delivered gross saving of $800 million, with over $1.6 billion in the first two years of our cost-efficiency program. This puts us well on track to exceed our target of $2 billion over 2021, 2023 and mitigate recent inflationary pressures. Despite margin pressures, our excellent top-line growth and diligent cost management enabled us to deliver currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 11.9% to $5.34, excluding Russia and Ukraine. This includes unfavorable currency of $0.85 and a small contribution from Swedish Match net of financing cost for the 50 days of consolidated results. For total PMI, we delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $5.98. We also had a strong finish to the year. We delivered excellent Q4 organic net revenue growth of plus 7.9%, excluding Russia and Ukraine. Again, reflecting continued strong IQOS performance and robust combustible pricing. Our Q4 operating income margin expanded organically by 80 basis-points, excluding Russia and Ukraine mainly due to a favorable comparison. On the total PMI basis, organic margin were flat including the impact of a challenging comparison in Ukraine and shipment timing in Russia. Fourth quarter currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS grew by plus 20.8% to $1.23, excluding Russia and Ukraine and plus 15.3% in total to $1.39, an excellent performance. Before discussing our 2023 guidance, I would like to provide an update on our Ukraine and Russia businesses. We continue to support our employees in Ukraine. I would like to personally thank them for their tremendous efforts to secure our business continuity during these extremely difficult times. In Russia, the environment for divestment has become increasingly challenging and complex, especially given recent December 2022 regulatory developments. To provide more clarity to investors on the full extent of our business, we will now include both Ukraine and Russia in our 2023 outlook and reporting. Now turning to the 2023 outlook, we expect to deliver very strong organic net revenue growth of plus 7% to plus 8.5%, supported by a step-up in combustible pricing and another year of rapid progress from IQOS. This would represent the third consecutive year of organic top-line growth above plus 7% and excludes the impact of Swedish Match for the large majority of the year. Including Swedish Match, we expect our reported currency-neutral net revenues to grow into the teens as its business continue to deliver strong performance. We expect excellent IQOS momentum to increase our HTU volume growth on the total PMI basis supported by the growing presence of ILUMA across our key markets. We forecast between 125 billion and 130 billion HTU shipment volumes, representing plus 15% to plus 19% growth. This reflects an acceleration compared to the total PMI growth rate in 2022 despite an expectation of no significant progress in Russia given our decision to restrict investment and innovation. As mentioned previously, the pace of ILUMA launches has also been constrained by supply-chain disruption and the outstanding take up in initial launch markets. We expect these constraint to gradually improve through the first half as we progressively roll-out to more geographies. We expect organic smoke-free net revenue growth to have an aligned progression with the rate of HTU volume growth this year with less distortion from device revenues. Including Swedish Match and at constant-currency, we expect to deliver around $13.5 billion in smoke-free net revenue compared to $10 billion in 2022 and to approach 40% of total PMI net revenues this year. While our topline outlook is very strong, like many other global companies, we are facing significant margin pressure from the intensifying inflationary environment in addition to a number of specific transitory factors and investment, which I will come back to shortly. As a result, we expect our adjusted operating income margin to contract between 50 to 150 basis-points organically. Accordingly, we forecast currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 7% to plus 9%. This includes a full year's positive contribution from Swedish Match net of the related interest expense. However, this benefit is offset by the increased interest cost on our non-Swedish Match debt and planned investments. This translate into an adjusted diluted EPS range of $6.25 to $6.37, including $0.15 of unfavorable currency at prevailing rates. This forecast notably, does not factor any potential favorable court ruling in Germany regarding the legality of the surcharge on the existing excise tax on heated tobacco product effective in Germany. as of 2022. We continue to account for the excise surcharge in our results and outlook. However, the obligation to pay the surcharge is currently suspended. If favorable the difference to our forecasted 2023 excise payment would increase our net revenue by around 1% and adjusted diluted EPS growth by around three point, thereby increasing our forecast currency-neutral growth range to plus 10% to plus 12%. In this scenario, we would expect our operating cash flow would move towards the upper half of our forecast range. We expect a judgment towards the end of the year. There are a number of other assumptions underpinning our outlook, we expect total international industry volumes of cigarettes and heated tobacco units excluding China and the U.S. to decline by minus 1% to minus 2%. Given our leadership in smoke-free product and the growth of the category, we expect to gain share and target total PMI shipment volume to be flat to plus 1%, which would represent the third consecutive year of growth. While we seek to maintain our share of the combustible category, given the current inflationary environment, we assume combustible pricing will accelerate to around plus 6% on an organic basis compared to the plus 5% realized in 2022. We also expect full-year capital expenditure of around $1.3 billion as compared to $1.1 billion in 2022, reflecting increased investment behind our smoke-free platform including ILUMA and Swedish Match portfolio. Let me now come back to the various factors impacting our margins. In 2022, total PMI gross margin contracted by 220 basis points organically. While growing inflationary pressures were a drag, the largest impact came from the combination of the rapid growth of ILUMA and transitory factors such as supply-chain disruption and the need to use air-freight. ILUMA drove accelerated device replacement from existing user in Japan and other launch market. Such devices sales are positive for acquisition, retention and full conversion. However, devices are margin-dilutive and this dynamic is likely to continue on a temporary basis, as we roll out to more markets this year and consumers upgrade from IQOS blade. The initially higher weight and cost of ILUMA consumable also played a role and this meant that the overall impact of our heat-not-burn business including devices was margin-dilutive in 2022. Importantly, average gross margin on HTUs remain around 10 percentage points higher than for cigarettes on the higher net revenue per unit. This is a fundamental long-term positive margin driver through the growing HTU volume mix in our business and this had a plus 110 basis-point favorable impact in 2022. Our two other key long-term margin drivers of pricing and productivities also continued to contribute favorably. Gross margin headwinds were mitigated at the operating income margin level by SG&A cost which declined by 150 basis-points of net revenues, due primarily to cost-efficiency, operating leverage and comparison effect. The picture for 2023 is quite different while our gross margin will face increased inflationary pressure, this is now primarily due to COGS for the cigarette business as leaf, acetate tow, salaries and energy cost increase. An acceleration in combustible pricing and lower air freight cost will serve to mitigate this exceptional inflation. However, a time lag is built into our projections. Importantly, while cost inflation is also headwind for IQOS, the 2023 margin impact of our heat-not-burn business is expected to be favorable due to the positive impact of increased HTU volume at higher net revenue per unit, planned ILUMA efficiencies and a more measured increase in device volumes. Overall, this underlying strength from IQOS combined with pricing will not be sufficient to offset combustible cost inflation in 2023, however, we expect a lower organic gross margin decline compared to last year and for our heat-not-burn business, to have an increasingly visible positive impact as we approach 2024. 2023 SG&A cost would include incremental investments to drive future growth, including in the commercialization of ILUMA. Also included is around $150 million with a broadly even split between the U.S., where we are preparing our organization capability for the launch of IQOS and wellness and healthcare investment in product development and clinical trials. In addition to inflation, this mean an SG&A cost increase more in line with net revenue growth is likely with limited margin impacts. A few words now on 2023 phasing. We expect margin pressures to be weighted to the first half, particularly given the challenging Q1 2022 comparison and a progressive decrease in airfreight cost throughout the year. In addition, investment are expected to be front loaded and we know that the rollout to ILUMA can lead to a short period of slower user acquisition as consumer wait for the launch. Combined with the timing of shipment and cost saving, we expect our 2023 top and bottom line delivery to be heavily H2 weighted. Indeed, we expect the first quarter to be the most challenging with low-single digit organic topline growth and soft margin. Shipment timing and ILUMA launch impact are expected to be pronounced and we accordingly expect HTU shipment volume of around 26 billion to 28 billion HTUs. We also face a comparison with a significantly lower impact from war related disruption. We forecast adjusted diluted EPS of $1.28 to $1.33, including $0.10 of unfavorable currency at prevailing rates. Importantly, we expect margin to improve as we approach 2024 as headwinds relent and the fundamental margin-accretive driver of our smoke-free transformation continue in the form of heated tobacco unit growth, pricing and cost optimization on ILUMA. Our cash flow generation remains strong. We delivered $10.8 billion in 2022 operating cash flows representing plus 3% growth on a currency-neutral basis. This include a favorable timing of certain financing item of around $0.3 billion. Given nonrecurring item and working capital movement benefited 2021 by around $1 billion, this was an excellent result. In 2023, we forecast $10 billion to $11 billion in operating cash-flow despite the notable expected impact from higher working capital requirements due to growth, global inflation and the reversal of one-off timing benefits. This put us on track to deliver our '21, '23 target of around $35 billion given in February 2021 at then prevailing rates. While our net debt is 2.9 times adjusted EBITDA on a 12 months trailing basis, this reflects only 50 days of Swedish Match results, including a full-year contribution for Swedish Match would clearly result in a lower ratio. We target robust EBITDA growth, which combined with strong cash flow allows us to focus on deleveraging, while continuing to invest in innovation and the growth of our business. In addition, our commitment to our progressive dividend policy is unwavering and in line with our long term commitment to return cash to shareholders. Turning back to our 2022 results, both our HTU and in-market sales volume increased by around 21.5% supporting total volume growth of plus 3.2%, excluding Russia and Ukraine. Q4 HTU shipment volume grew by plus 37.5%, partly reflecting the replenishment of inventory for ILUMA in Japan, following lower shipment earlier in the year and favorable shipment timing in the EU, notably in advance of new ILUMA launches. Supported by very solid cigarette performance, we delivered total volume growth for the second consecutive year, both including and excluding Russia and Ukraine. Focusing now on combustibles. Our portfolio delivered robust organic net revenue growth of plus 3.7% for the full-year excluding Russia and Ukraine. Combustible pricing increased in H2 as we continue to adjust to the inflationary environment. This resulted in Q4 organic pricing of plus 4.8%, excluding Russia and Ukraine and yielded full-year pricing in line with our expectation with notable contribution from Germany, the Philippines and Turkey, despite the impact of hyperinflationary accounting. In 2022, our share of the cigarette category increased by plus 0.3 percentage points excluding Russia and Ukraine following category share declines in 2020 and 2021, exacerbated by the pandemic. This includes sequential growth in every quarter of 2022. Marlboro remains extremely resilient despite pressure on disposable income and the impact of IQOS cannibalization with plus 0.2 percentage point share of segment growth. In addition, while we have not yet seen any meaningful acceleration in down trading, our share in the low price segment increased by plus 0.6 percentage points excluding Russia and Ukraine. As Jacek mentioned earlier, maintaining our leadership in the cigarette category is a key enabler in accelerating smokers switching to better alternative. Our robust cigarette share combined with the growth of IQOS delivered an overall market-share gain of plus 0.6 point in 2022, excluding Russia and Ukraine, with notable contribution from Egypt, Italy, Japan and Poland. PMI heated tobacco unit continue to strengthen the position towards becoming the largest nicotine brand in markets where IQOS is present and reached the number two position in 2022 with a record-high share of 8.5% in Q4. Now focusing on IQOS user growth, there were an estimated 20.3 million IQOS user as of December 31st, excluding Russia and Ukraine. This reflect growth of around plus 3.5 million for the full year. For total PMI, we estimate there were almost 25 million IQOS users as of year-end. Consistent with comments in our recent disclosures, user growth in October and November was slower due to higher-than-expected impact from commercial activity and lower acquisition for IQOS brand product in anticipation of the launch of ILUMA in certain key markets. However, we saw a strong rebound in December as ILUMA launches continued delivering robust user growth of plus $0.8 million for the quarter. This actually was close to our initial expectation and we look forward with confidence to 2023 as ILUMA continues to be deployed. ILUMA is driving volume and share growth across its market supporting our strong position in heat-not-burn category. We launched in eight new markets in Q4, including the Czech Republic, Italy, Portugal, and South Korea, bringing the total to 16 markets with ILUMA launched now represent more than half of our total HTU volume. ILUMA delivers a superior consumer experience as evidenced by net promoter scores which on average increased by more than 10 points across its different market archetypes and higher conversion rate compared to IQOS. While the rate of acceleration differ by market in both Switzerland and the more recently launched United Arab Emirates offtake share has almost doubled since launch. Importantly, as I mentioned earlier, the benefit of scale and optimization should allow us to bring down the cost of ILUMA overtime starting in the second half of 2023. Focusing now on the European Union where smoke-free net revenue exceeded 40% of the region for the full year. Our fourth quarter HTU share increased by plus 2.4 points to reach 8.8% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume with a modest flattering effect from timing factor. IMS volumes continue to grow sequentially and reached a record high of 9.3 billion units on the four-quarter moving average. This reflects success across many markets and key cities including Vilnius with over 43% share, as well as Athens and Rome with over 25%. In Japan the heat-not-burn category now represents close to 35% of total tobacco with IQOS increasingly driving its growth In Q4, the adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by plus 2.6 points to 24.5% with offtake share in Tokyo surpassing 30%. Our two-tier consumable portfolio continued to deliver strong results. IMS again grew sequentially to reach a record-high of 8.8 billion units on a four-quarter moving average as the number of Japanese IQOS users crossed a remarkable 7.5 million adult consumers. In addition to strong IQOS gain in developed countries, we continue to see very promising growth in low and middle-income market. In 2022, our HTU shipments grew by almost 50% excluding Russia and Ukraine. This robust performance reflects success across many markets, including Egypt where Urban Cairo exit offtake share surpassed 7% Bulgaria and Malaysia where Q4 offtake share reached 14% in both capital cities. Let's now move on to Swedish Match which finished the year strongly further confirming our belief that this combination will be accretive to our growth and margin profile over the coming years. Please note for housekeeping purposes, that my comments on Swedish Match Financial Results are based on publicly available information through September 30th and from November 11th when it was consolidated in PMI's financial statements. Swedish Match delivered excellent performance following the acquisition, with strong net revenue and adjusted operating income. Most impressive was the phenomenal U.S. growth of ZYN which I will come back to on the next slide. In other U.S. smoke-free products, moist snuff also performed well gaining almost one percentage point share of segment and growing 2022 volumes within a declining category. In Scandinavia, the overall smoke-free market and Swedish Match continued to grow, albeit helped by year end trade inventory movements ahead of a January excise tax increase in Sweden. The cigar business delivered robust performance to end a challenging year with growth in volume and category share. We are very pleased with the strong 2022 results from Swedish Match, which also included positive pricing across all smoke-free category. We look forward to reporting our combined results going forward. Now let's discuss ZYN's recent U.S. performance in more detail. Excellent progress continues with shipment volume growth of plus 37% in 2022 and plus 35% in Q4, reaching a record quarterly high. ZYN category volume share grew sequentially by one percentage point compared to the third quarter and by 2.2 percentage points compared to the prior year, further strengthening its position as the clear number one nicotine pouch brand despite continued heavy competitive discounting from less premium offerings. Importantly retail value share for ZYN remains strong at 75.7%, highlighting its premium positioning and high brand equity. 2023 promises to be a very exciting year. We are thrilled to have welcomed Swedish Match employee and leading oral nicotine portfolio into the PMI, family to create a global smoke-free champion. And we will look we will work together to create value as we accelerate towards our shared vision of the smoke-free future. In particular, bringing in ZYN and IQOS together in both the U.S. and international markets present a significant opportunity to drive accelerated growth and switching of adult smoker to better alternative. As a well-run and successful business we expect continued strong performance from Swedish Match existing operation. A key focus this year will be supporting and further driving strong in growth in the U.S. In addition, we are now preparing for the international expansion of nicotine pouches leveraging Swedish Match rich product portfolio and PMI's extensive smoke-free commercial infrastructure. In parallel, we will be actively Swedish Match U.S. distribution and commercial capabilities for the launch of IQOS in 2024. Moving to sustainability. As we transform our company our business and sustainability strategies are advancing hand-to-hand with increasing momentum. PMI and Swedish Match have a shared vision and values. The combination helps us further accelerate towards achieving our purpose, transforming for good to make cigarettes obsolete and maximize the benefit of smoke-free products. Our goal for best in class ESG performance is aligned as we seek to address the environmental impact of our product, eradicate child labor, reduce our carbon footprint and provide a more inclusive and empowered working environment for all our employees. In December, we published a standalone report detailing our new biodiversity and water ambitions. For biodiversity we aim to achieve no low net loss on ecosystem connected to our value chain by 2033 and contribute towards to a net positive impact on nature by 2050. For Water Stewardship we aim to scale solutions towards a positive impact on water resources by 2033 and contribute towards a positive impact on water resources by 2050. I am also proud to share that for the third consecutive year we have been awarded CDP's Triple A. CDP scored nearly 15,000 companies on their climate change forest and water security disclosures, of which only 12 received this strategic prestigious score. In addition I am excited to share that we are included in the 2023 Bloomberg GenderEquality Index for the third year running. I'll now turn back to Jacek for concluding remarks. Hi, Chris. No, I think you were very exhaustive clearly, Jacek. Just sort of couple of further detail and clearly, in '23, we've been flagging it. We expect our heat-not-burn business to contribute positively at the level of the gross margin rate evolution. So in '23 it's really inflation impacting us very negatively at the level of all cost of goods, but on combustible, we are going to increase price that is not going to be sufficient to offset this impact. And just to give you a color, Jacek was alluding to energy price. We're not talking about even the double-digit inflation, I mean energy price between '23 and '21 we are talking about close to a 3x factor. So it's a big increase with the big impact on the P&L. Over time with price increase, we're going to overcome that, but there is just a lag as we said on matching that. Then there is a big difference also on our SG&A cost evolution. In 2022, we were flat, because we've been generating a lot of efficiencies, inflation was not as others is going to be in '23 with a lot of salary increase and probably on the basis of comparison were more favorable. In '23, we expect to grow our SG&A in line with top-line, more or less which one would expect. We continue to invest a lot in order to support the growth of the business to acquire new user, digital investment. We talk about the U.S. and wellness and healthcare and there would still be efficiency, but not at the same level. Last element that I have to add, the cost of the debt, I'm not talking about the debt of acquisition of Swedish Match because for Swedish Match, we are in line with expectation i.e. low single-digit accretion on the EPS. But clearly for the existing debt, there is also an increase in the cost and that is having an impact on the evolution of the adjusted EPS. I think with that, Chris, we are giving all the information we can on what we are facing in term of evolution on our cost. Good morning, Bonnie. I'm please to take that one, Bonnie. So I think, on the U.S., we've been clear on the fact that we expect something like half of around $150 million, of course it's a rounding of extra investment in the U.S. as we prepare the launch of IQOS in the U.S. that is for 2023. When we have a plan for the coming years and of course, with more detail, we will of course come to you and elaborate and detail that. Now for the rest of the business, I think we are and that was the sense of my comment on SG&A evolution. On a relatively regular basis, we are investing an extra few $100 million in ILUMA to be more specific, because, of course, very sensitive information behind the acceleration of IQOS and it's going to come, of course, behind IQOS ILUMA in 2023. So the growth, when we say, we expect SG&A to grow broadly in line with topline, there is a huge impact of inflation. I mean, I don't need to explain that inflation is in most country around high single digit and we need to reflect that on salary increase. We have efficiency on cost in front of that and that is enabling us to on top of the inflation impact to keep investing on the growth of the business and we do that in a rather consistent manner, of course, very much focus behind ILUMA in 2023. Thank you, Bonnie. Hi Pams. Look I think, you should expect us of course to accompany the growth we are growing volume within more capacities, so the CapEx will reflect that. There is certainly, when it comes to ILUMA, a moment where we build the capacity for ILUMA and that is translating into a significant investment. So you see that in the 1.3. I would say, we are going to certainly regularly invest on the capacity for the Swedish Match overall business, so I'm not able to get at that stage. I'm not giving guidance on '24. I certainly believe that there is this transition moment where we are building the capacity on ILUMA then of course that will be accompanying the growth of ILUMA and - and we are very ambitious, as you know, on growing overall product. So that will come with investment, but, of course, they are not of the same magnitude as the one that we've been making in order to be the capacity on IQOS, smaller volume, smaller base. So notwithstanding back on the long-term anyway. Thank you. Thank you."

Today\u2019s call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. James Bushnell, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead.\nJames Bushnell: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2022 third quarter results. You may access the release on www.pmi.com. A glossary of terms, including the definition for reduced-risk products, or \"RRPs,\" as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures, and additional smoke-free volume and net revenue data are at the end of today\u2019s webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Unless otherwise stated, all references to IQOS are to our IQOS heat-not-burn products, and all references to smoke-free products are to our RRPs. Growth rates presented on an organic basis reflect currency-neutral adjusted results excluding acquisitions and disposals. Figures and comparisons presented on a pro forma basis entirely exclude PMI\u2019s operations in Russia and Ukraine. As mentioned previously, starting in the second quarter of 2022, and on a comparative basis, PMI excludes amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles from its adjusted results. Today\u2019s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today\u2019s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. I\u2019m joined today by Jacek Olczak, Chief Executive Officer; and Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer. Jacek will join us for the question-and-answer session. Over to you, Emmanuel.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, James, and welcome everyone. Today marks a historic day in our journey towards a smoke-free future, with the certainty that we will have full control of IQOS, the world\u2019s leading smoke-free product in the United States, the world\u2019s largest smoke-free market from April 30, 2024. Indeed, today\u2019s agreement with Altria removes the potential of a protracted legal process to regain the U.S. rights to IQOS which Altria previously held, subject to performance milestones, until 2029. We have ambitious plans for the full-scale launch and rapid expansion of IQOS in the U.S. market as soon as we take over and efficient time during the transition period to put our commercial model and related organization and infrastructure in place using our wealth of experience from international markets. We see IQOS as the primary vector for establishing a leadership position in the U.S. smoke-free industry and it will be followed by the other products in our smoke-free portfolio. In this context, Swedish Match offers an immediate position in the oral segment, and mutually beneficial synergies at sales force level. However, should the offer fail, we can certainly build a robust sales force as part of our commercial deployment engine during the transition period. Under both scenarios we see an accelerated path to profitability with an attractive payback period on our IQOS investment, given superior U.S. unit economics and the absence of a legacy cigarette business. I will cover this in more detail later. With regard to Swedish Match, we announced this morning an update to our offer with our best and final price of SEK 116. Our updated offer retains a 90% acceptance condition, which is critical to allow us to capture the full potential of the combination. Now that we are close to the end of the offer period, the increased offer is primarily intended to fairly reflect the higher net value to us of the portion of Swedish Match\u2019s cash flows which are in U.S. dollars given currency movements since our initial offer was announced in May. Equity markets, the global economy and interest rates have also moved unfavorably since then. As such, we believe the updated price, with a premium of 52.5% to the undisturbed share price prior to the initial offer, strengthens the attractiveness yet further for Swedish Match shareholders while maintaining strong value creation for PMI shareholders. This is our best and final price and we hope to complete the transaction next month to achieve full ownership. Turning now to our Q3 earnings, we delivered another very strong performance this quarter, with HTU volumes ahead of our forecast, and robust growth in total volumes, market share and combustible net revenues. With adjusted operating income margins in line with expectations, this resulted in total Q3 adjusted diluted EPS of $1.53, close to our all-time quarterly high despite notable currency headwinds. IQOS\u2019 excellent performance continued, with plus 22% growth in pro forma HTU shipment volumes, a testament to the continued strengthening of our heat-not-burn portfolio and broad-based growth across key regions. IQOS ILUMA continues to drive growth in its launch markets. In combustibles, we delivered robust performance with Q3 organic pro forma net revenue growth exceeding plus 4%, driven by accelerated pricing of almost plus 5%. Cigarette shipment volumes were essentially stable and category share grew, supported by Marlboro, showcasing the resilience of the brand despite current economic conditions. Turning now to the headline numbers, our Q3 volumes grew by 2.3% on a pro forma basis, and by 0.6% in total, including Russia and Ukraine. Pro forma net revenues grew organically by plus 6.9% and by plus 6.7% for total PMI. Our total organic net revenue per unit grew by plus 4.5% on a pro forma basis and by plus 6.1% in total despite lower device revenues. This reflects the increasing weight of IQOS in our sales mix and a step up in combustible pricing. Our Q3 adjusted operating income margin declined organically by 100 basis points on a pro forma basis and by 90 basis points in total, consistent with our expectations. As previously communicated, this reflects the recovery in device volumes, the investments in launching ILUMA including initially higher unit costs, the impact of supply chain disruption, notably due to the war in Ukraine and increasing global inflationary pressures. Despite these headwinds, our strong top-line growth and ongoing cost efficiencies enabled us to outperform our previous currency-neutral guidance to deliver adjusted diluted pro forma EPS of $1.33, including unfavorable currency of $0.23, representing 8.3% currency-neutral growth. Including Russia and Ukraine, we delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $1.53. Our strong third quarter, combined with a robust H1, supported an excellent delivery for the year-to-date. I would highlight our strong pro forma volume growth of plus 3.4% and organic net revenue growth of plus 7.7%, again reflecting continued strong IQOS performance, pricing, and the recovery of the combustible business in many markets against a pandemic-affected comparison. Smoke-free net revenues made up around 30% of our year-to-date pro forma total, putting us on track to reach our ambition of over 50% by 2025. Our year-to-date operating income margin contracted organically by 110 basis points on a pro forma basis, driven by the factors mentioned previously. We remain on track to deliver cost savings of $2 billion over 2021-2023. $1.5 billion of gross savings have already been delivered, including over $200 million in Q3. This allows us to reinvest in the business and mitigate increasing inflationary pressures. Year-to-date currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS grew by plus 9.7% to $4.11 on a pro forma basis and by plus 8.8% in total to $4.59; an excellent performance. Now, let\u2019s turn to the pro forma full year outlook. Given the continued growth of IQOS and robust trends in combustibles, we are revising our top-line forecasts upwards to 2% to 3% growth in total shipment volumes, and 6.5% to 8% growth in organic net revenues. While our top-line outlook remains very strong, like many other global companies we are facing significant inflationary forces in the world economy, and this is reflected in our updated adjusted OI margin forecast. Inflation in our cost of goods remained mid-single-digit in the third quarter. However, inflationary pressures are growing as we renew pricing arrangements, notably for certain direct materials, wages, energy, and transportation costs. In addition, the very strong growth of ILUMA in Japan and other launch markets has an initial negative margin impact, given the higher weight of the consumables and increased cost of both the device and consumables, in the first 12 to 18 months of activation. As mentioned previously, the combination of strong demand, global supply chain disruption and the impact of cancelling induction HTU production in Russia, means our supply chain is not fully optimized. This has resulted in reduced productivity and a number of additional costs, including an approximate $300 million impact from a significant increase in the use of air freight. As a result, while we continue to expect a rebound in our Q4 adjusted OI margin, partly reflecting higher commercial investments in the prior year, we are now forecasting less expansion than previously expected, with pro forma adjusted organic operating income margin flat to slightly negative for the full year. Despite this change to margin expectations, our top-line momentum is strong and we continue to forecast pro forma adjusted diluted EPS growth of 10% to 12% for 2022. This translates into a pro forma adjusted diluted EPS forecast of $5.22 to $5.33, including an estimated unfavorable currency impact of $0.87 at prevailing rates, notably due to the euro and Japanese yen. There is a slide in the appendix with further detail on the estimated exchange rate impact. For total PMI, which assumes a full year contribution from Russia and Ukraine, we expect adjusted diluted EPS of almost $6, including an estimated $0.80 unfavorable currency impact. Lastly, given the continued success of ILUMA and the cancellation of TEREA production in Russia I just referenced, we are working to further accelerate our production of induction consumables. As we convert and transition capacity from blade to induction, we incur certain inefficiencies and limits on the availability of ILUMA HTUs. We are optimizing our inventory levels where possible to minimize any impact on consumer availability. However, these factors are a constraint on our shipments and we are updating our HTU shipment volume forecast to 89 billion to 91 billion units for the year. Importantly, this is a short-term supply dynamic. Consumer offtake trends remain strong and HTU in-market sales volumes are expected to further accelerate their growth to over 25% in Q4, while also growing sequentially compared to Q3. The cash generation capacity of our business remains exceptional, as shown through the challenges of recent years. Our balance sheet and cash flow remain strong. We delivered operating cash flow of $7.7 billion year-to-date, representing growth of 6.5% on a currency-neutral basis. Today we reconfirm our forecast of around $10.5 billion in operating cash flow for the full year, despite an estimated currency headwind of around $1.3 billion. This means we expect to deliver an excellent $22.5 billion over 2021 and 2022. Cash flow was flattered somewhat in 2021 by $0.5 billion from one-off impacts and the timing factors of certain cash flows which benefitted 2021 at the expense of 2022; and by a further $0.5 billion of working capital improvements. However, our 2022 forecast demonstrates underlying growth against this exceptional year. I would also like to highlight that U.S. dollar strength has a positive impact on our net debt, given that more than 60% of our financing is in euros, including derivative overlays. This serves to offset the impact on our earnings and, combined with strong cash generation, contributed to a $1.5 billion reduction in our net debt since December 2021, which is now below 1.6 times adjusted EBITDA on a 12-month rolling basis. This delivery highlights our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet, pay down debt, and invest in the growth of our business. In addition, we recently increased our annualized dividend for the 15th consecutive year, in line with our long-term commitment to return cash to shareholders. Turning back to our results. Our total pro forma shipment volumes increased by 2.3% for Q3 and 3.4% year-to-date, putting us comfortably on track to deliver total volume growth for the second consecutive year on both a pro forma and total PMI basis. Pro forma HTU shipment volumes grew by 21.9% for the third quarter and 15.8% year-to-date. While our shipments have been more volatile this year reflecting the current supply chain dynamics, HTU IMS growth has been consistently strong with 18.2% growth in Q3 and 19.2% year-to-date, with robust performance in the EU Region, Japan, and Low and Middle-Income markets. As I mentioned, we expect a further acceleration of IMS growth in Q4. Focusing now on combustibles, our portfolio delivered robust pro forma organic net revenue growth of 4.1% in Q3 and essentially stable pro forma shipment volume. Our pro forma pricing accelerated to 4.9% in Q3 as we progressively adjust to the inflationary environment. This reflects notable contributions from Australia, Germany, and the Philippines, and a positive quarterly variance from Indonesia for the first time since Q4 2019. We now expect full year pricing to be around 4%. Our pro forma share of the cigarette category increased by 0.2 points year-to-date. This was supported by Marlboro, where volumes grew by almost 4% for total PMI. With a premium position in a challenging consumer environment, this represents an impressive performance from the world\u2019s leading cigarette brand. Our leadership in combustibles helps to maximize switching to smoke-free products and we continue to target a stable category share over time, despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization. The positive combination of stable share in combustibles and the continued growth of IQOS positions us to deliver total market share growth over time. We captured 0.5 points of pro forma share gains in Q3 and 0.6 points year-to-date, with notable contributions from Italy, Indonesia, Japan, and Poland. Despite increasing competition in many markets, our leading share of the growing heat-not-burn category has remained stable since the start of the year at around 75% and grew sequentially in the third quarter. This remarkable achievement is supported by the increasing deployment of a 2-tier HTU portfolio, providing adult smokers with an expanding range of innovative and high-quality alternatives to cigarettes. PMI HTUs again strengthened their position as the second largest nicotine brand in markets where IQOS is present, with a sequential share gain in Q3 of 0.2 points to a record 7.7% share, excluding Russia and Ukraine. Focusing now on IQOS performance, we estimate there were approximately 19.5 million IQOS users as of September 30th, excluding Russia and Ukraine. This reflects growth of around 0.5 million users in Q3 and 2.7 million year-to-date. As shown on the right-hand side of this slide, the third quarter of each year typically experiences slower pro forma user growth due to seasonal factors. The growth of 0.5 million this quarter was very robust in a historical context, noting that the high growth in Q3 2020 benefited from a catch-up effect following the relaxation of COVID restrictions on retail locations and mobility. Importantly, we expect a strong acceleration in user growth in the fourth quarter of 2022. In the EU Region, smoke-free net revenues comprised almost 40% of regional net revenues year-to-date, with a number of markets well above 50%. This performance clearly shows the way towards our ambition to be predominantly smoke-free by 2025. Our EU third quarter HTU share increased by 2.0 points compared to Q3 last year to reach 7.3% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume. I would also highlight the 0.2-point sequential increase, which is a notably strong performance given the usual seasonality of the combustible market. Most importantly, adjusted IMS volumes continued to grow sequentially and reached a record high of 8.7 billion units on a four-quarter moving average. We expect IMS volume growth to continue in Q4, with a corresponding increase in market share. Please refer to the appendix for additional key city and market share data. With regard to regulation in the EU, we are encouraged by the increasing number of countries adopting multi-year fiscal frameworks with clear differentiation of smoke-free products, such as the recent legislation in Romania. We expect the proposal on the EU Tobacco Excise Directive to be published by year-end and hope for a similar approach. As a reminder, the Tobacco Excise Directive will require unanimous support for approval by all 27 EU member states. Now, let\u2019s focus on the performance of ILUMA in the EU region. ILUMA continues to drive user acquisition, the switching of existing users and accelerated category growth in both Spain and Switzerland. In Q3 both markets experienced another quarter of strong sequential IMS volume growth, with offtake exit volume of TEREA now the clear majority of HTU sales in both markets. We also launched ILUMA in Greece at the end of June with promising initial results and introduced the product to Portugal earlier this month. In Japan, the adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by 2.8 points versus the prior year quarter to 23.6%. As in the EU, Q3 last year saw an optical sequential share decline due to combustible seasonality, making the 0.7-point sequential increase this quarter a notable achievement. IMS again grew sequentially to reach a record high of 8.3 billion units on a four-quarter moving average. This was driven by the impressive performance of IQOS ILUMA and the continued growth in key cities such as Tokyo. The heat-not-burn category now represents over one-third of total tobacco in Japan, with IQOS increasingly driving this year\u2019s growth. IQOS ILUMA celebrated its first anniversary of the Japan national launch in September and continues to exhibit strong growth due to excellent conversion, consumer satisfaction, and retention rates. Our premium-priced TEREA HTUs continued to grow strongly in Q3 and strengthened their position as both the second largest nicotine brand and largest RRP brand in Japan, reaching an exit offtake share of 14.9%. Encouragingly, SENTIA HTUs have also grown rapidly since the initial launch in April and national expansion in mid-July, driving consumer acquisition in the mainstream price segment. We exited Q3 with over 25% HTU offtake share, a record high, and continue to see a long runway of growth in Japan over the coming quarters. In addition to strong IQOS gains in developed countries, we continue to see very promising growth in Low and Middle-Income markets which drove around 30% of the Company\u2019s pro forma HTU growth in Q3. Given the large size of these markets, the premium positioning of the existing IQOS portfolio and the relatively early stage of commercialization, this represents outstanding progress. Strong growth in IMS volumes continued, and the pro forma share of our HTU brands grew 0.9 points versus the prior year quarter to 2.8% in Q3, a robust performance, considering the impact of seasonality. This reflects success across many markets, with notable progress in Lebanon, where Q3 offtake share in Beirut increased by 7 points to 18%, and Egypt, where offtake share in Cairo is approaching 6%. Further key city data can be found in the appendix. We are also encouraged by recent positive regulatory developments in the Philippines where the government passed a new law clearly differentiating combustible and noncombustible tobacco products. Smoke-free products will be regulated separately, with different health warnings, permitted product testing or guided trials, and rules to be established for product communication and point of sale activities that will support the switching of adult smokers to better alternatives. In addition, the latest development from our smoke-free innovation pipeline is a new heat-not-burn device that is especially relevant for low- and middle-income markets. It is a simple, convenient, and affordable proposition, which can cater to local taste preferences without compromising on the reduced risk profile of the product. We are planning pilot city launches in Colombia and the Philippines during the fourth quarter, as we further expand our portfolio of smoke-free products to serve different consumer needs. As we continue to innovate, it\u2019s critical to integrate sustainability through eco-design principles, circularity, and efforts to minimize and manage post-consumer waste. Addressing the environmental impact of our products is a key pillar of our sustainability strategy, which is reflected in our sustainability index and forms part of our executive compensation scheme. Our approach to reduce waste related to cigarettes, RRP consumables, devices and packaging is covered in a report, case studies and campaign published last month and available via a dedicated microsite on pmi.com. For example, we are progressing well towards our 2025 aspirations of having at least 80% of our shipment volumes covered by markets with anti-littering programs in place for cigarettes and for over 1 million cumulative smoke-free devices to be refreshed or repaired. Moreover, during September more than 10,000 stakeholders from more than 60 markets joined cleanup initiatives around the world. I am proud of our ESG performance which continues to be recognized worldwide. Our 2021 Low-Carbon Transition Plan and our Business Transformation Strategy were recently nominated for sustainability prizes, and our Chief Sustainability Officer, Jennifer Motles, was nominated for CSO of the year at the World Sustainability Awards. Moving now to perhaps the most impactful news of today, we are delighted to announce that we will soon have full control of IQOS, the world\u2019s leading smoke-free product, in the United States, the world\u2019s largest smoke-free market. As previously communicated, following the ITC decision last year prohibiting the import of IQOS into the U.S., we have been in discussions with Altria to find the best path forward. PMI\u2019s priority has always been to find a solution that best positions IQOS to realize its full potential in the U.S., as quickly as possible. I am excited to report that we have now reached an outcome that achieves this goal. Let me start by briefly summarizing the key terms of the agreement. From April 30, 2024, PMI will have full control over the commercialization of IQOS in the U.S., allowing us to distribute and sell the product, and critically engage directly with adult tobacco users. As part of the agreement, we will pay a total cash consideration of around $2.7 billion to Altria. We believe this agreement represents excellent value to our shareholders, as with the previous agreement potentially stretching to 2029, this solution provides certainty by avoiding what could have been a protracted and uncertain legal process that would have severely held back the development of IQOS. It provides a clear near-term path to commercializing at scale in the U.S., with the unencumbered backing of PMI\u2019s full strategic and financial commitment to the product\u2019s success. IQOS is the world\u2019s leading smoke-free product, with remarkable and rapid growth achieved across a wide range of international markets. From a standing start in 2015, IQOS is already a $9 billion annual net revenue business, having created the attractive heat-not-burn category and driving its growth. The U.S. is the world\u2019s biggest accessible nicotine market by retail value. The estimated retail value of its growing smoke-free market is already around 60% of all international markets combined, excluding China. We have spoken before about our plans to bring a leading portfolio to the U.S. and we expect IQOS to be at the very core of our U.S. smoke-free future, just as it already is elsewhere. The U.S. opportunity for IQOS is particularly encouraging given the clear demand from American adult smokers for credible smoke-free alternatives to cigarettes. Moreover, current smoke-free products have had limited success in fully switching adult smokers away from cigarettes. In the U.S. there are ample opportunities to build adult smoker awareness and understanding of smoke-free product offers, something that is particularly true for IQOS given our MRTP authorizations. We are ready to invest behind IQOS to bring it to market at scale across the U.S., starting with full-scale launches in key cities and regions, with a plan to progress rapidly to national penetration. IQOS remains the only inhalable smoke-free nicotine product to have received a Modified Risk Tobacco Product Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. We know from our experience in over 65 markets worldwide that IQOS\u2019s appeal to adult smokers who have tried the product is strong, as demonstrated by high full switching rates. We have a strong commitment to build awareness and invest behind the category to drive product trial among American smokers. The true potential for IQOS in the U.S. is substantial, as illustrated by the double-digit national shares achieved in just a few years across a number of Asian, European, and other markets, all with varying demographic profiles and adult smoker taste preferences. We believe a volume share of 10% of cigarettes and HTUs by 2030 is very achievable, with potential to go much further. Importantly, the return on investment for IQOS in the highly profitable U.S. tobacco market is compelling. We estimate the total U.S. industry profit pool at over $20 billion, and with average unit margins on U.S. cigarettes more than 3 times greater than for the PMI average, the payback over the next few years on the consideration paid to Altria looks very attractive. As we do not have a legacy cigarette business in the U.S., the opportunity is purely incremental. This also reflects a current excise tax system with no differentiation for heated tobacco products versus cigarettes at the federal level, and differentials on a limited basis in only a handful of states, thus presenting a clear additional opportunity over time. We are already advanced in our plans for IQOS in the U.S., as we prepare for domestic manufacturing and for important regulatory submissions, including for IQOS ILUMA where we plan to file a PMTA in H2 2023. As mentioned previously, we target the first half of next year for the resumption of IQOS domestic supply, which will be available to Altria under our current arrangement up until PMI assumes full commercial responsibility in April 2024. Our proposed combination with Swedish Match would provide certain U.S. sales and distribution capabilities. However, in the case of failure we have a clear path forward for IQOS and the rest of our smoke-free portfolio. Indeed, the most critical parts of the IQOS commercial model center on converting adult smokers, rather than distribution. In addition, the U.S. has an established distribution and retail landscape, with a clear route-to-market. We therefore also have concrete plans to proceed autonomously in building fully controlled and managed U.S. sales and distribution capabilities over the next 18 months leading up to April 2024, in order to ensure a successful IQOS roll-out and the introduction of other smoke-free products should our Swedish Match offer fail. Indeed, we believe today\u2019s agreement is fundamental to unlock the U.S. smoke-free market. As we have shared previously, we expect the heated tobacco category to remain the largest and fastest growing in dollar terms internationally. While the e-vapor and, to a lesser extent, nicotine pouch categories have paved the way for smoke-free products in the U.S., we know that heated tobacco comes closest to replicating the experience that smokers enjoy, with higher conversion and very low unintended use. To conclude today\u2019s presentation, our business delivered strong third-quarter and year-to-date performance, despite some challenging headwinds, and we expect to deliver another excellent year of double-digit adjusted diluted EPS growth on a pro forma currency-neutral basis. Most impressive was the continued excellent IQOS performance, with strong shipment volume and IMS growth reflecting broad-based momentum in the EU region, Japan, and emerging markets. We remain excited by the promising results of IQOS ILUMA, our rich pipeline of smoke-free innovation, and plans for further launches of both ILUMA and VEEBA in the fourth quarter and in 2023. We continue to accelerate investment in our commercial programs, digital engine, and R&D for long-term growth, as well as behind a number of growth opportunities across categories and geographies. The return from such investments remains compelling, as demonstrated by the exceptional top- and bottom-line growth delivered over recent years. In addition to growth in smoke-free products, our combustible business continues to perform well, with organic net revenue growth and essentially stable pro forma shipment volumes. Despite accelerated pricing in the current inflationary environment, temporary margin pressure from inflation and supply chain inefficiencies is likely to continue in the coming quarters. Importantly, our underlying growth fundamentals remain strong and we look forward with confidence. We have secured our near-term access to the substantial U.S. opportunity for IQOS, also forming the backbone for introducing our broader smoke-free portfolio. We are now advancing on our plans to launch at scale with or without Swedish Match. And finally, we have increased the dividend every year as a public company, through the ups and downs of economic and currency cycles. We continue to be steadfastly committed to returning cash to shareholders, as we advance towards our ambition to become predominantly smoke-free by 2025. Thank you. And before we start the question-and-answer session, please note that we are not able to comment on our offer for Swedish Match beyond what has been announced. All materials related to the offer can be found on the website, smokefreeoffer.com. And Jacek and I, we are now more than happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Chris Growe with Stifel.\nChris Growe: I wanted to ask first, if I could, in relation to the operating margin. And I think it was up, if I have my numbers right, about a -- little over 100 basis points if I exclude foreign exchange and acquisitions year-to-date. And I just want to get a sense when you look at the operating margin now, your expectation being down a little bit for the year. Does that incorporate a weaker fourth quarter operating margin? And I guess to understand what\u2019s behind that, if I have my numbers correct here.\nEmmanuel Babeau: No, I don\u2019t think so, Chris. We are organically before ForEx down for the first nine months with a number of impacts that we described due to the situation, of course, of strong disruption on the supply chain coming from the war in Ukraine and the situation in Russia. We have, of course, some element, of course, attached to the development of IQOS ILUMA, and that is, of course, playing. We have a lot of air freight that is impacting the margin. So, you have a number of temporary elements that I\u2019ve been with us since almost the beginning of the year, and that drove the operating margin down. I think that it will take a little bit of time for us to be removed. But we also have seen, for the first line, something that is going to obviously stay with us, which is the inflation. We are seeing an inflation level for the time being around mid-single-digit. It could strengthen further because when we look at the number of inflation in many countries, it is above this mid-single-digit numbers. As we\u2019ve been saying, we are entering into the renewal of a number of contracts that protected us to some extent on the way we are buying energy and the number of components. So, that means that this part of inflation is going to stay. But in Q4, actually, with a more positive mix and some maybe one-off having a lower impact, we are expecting rather a better situation on margin evolution versus the first 9 months. So, that\u2019s the opposite. We expect the Q4 that should be in terms of margin evolution, better than the first nine months.\nChris Growe: Okay. Thank you. And then just a second question would be, in relation to -- you took your volume estimate up for the year, which is very encouraging. You had a very strong performance year-to-date. There\u2019s been a lot of concerns about trade down activity, the concerns of consumers -- having discretionary spending in particular in Europe and particularly as we move forward, as energy costs continue to remain so high. Are you seeing any signs of that, any break down activity, or anything you could share that would help us get a better feeling for the performance of some of your premium brands? Thank you.\nJacek Olczak: Hi Chris, it\u2019s Jacek. Not really. If you look at the down trading type of a pressure, we still don\u2019t see really an acceleration of the tracks, right? So obviously, we see the Indonesia, Philippines under pressure. But it\u2019s not much really changed versus what we have seen before. Now, one could argue that in some geographies that the inflation has a bit of a lagging sort of evolution but nothing today. And you could see also from the shows of Marlboro, right, that we will look pretty strong on the premium propositions. Okay? Despite the fact that we\u2019re taking the pricing and there will be pricing -- more pricing to come.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley.\nPamela Kaufman: So, the U.S. is clearly a large growth and profit opportunity for IQOS, and it helps that you don\u2019t have an existing combustibles business here. How would your commercialization strategy in the U.S. change if you came into the U.S. through Swedish Match or independently? And how should investors think about the required level of investment to commercialize IQOS in the U.S. and the impact to your growth algorithm?\nJacek Olczak: So -- I mean what stands behind the success of IQOS is really the front-end consumer interface, right? That\u2019s the commercialization aspect, which makes -- is one of the key elements of IQOS success, which we measure as the highest in the industry rates of conversion and adoption of IQOS and therefore, switching from cigarettes. Swedish Match doesn\u2019t have it, right? Swedish Match is the component of the sales force, which is essentially in store execution, but IQOS success hinges on that business-to-consumer component. So, in above scenario, obviously, that\u2019s the investment, which is front of us, but vis-\u00e0-vis a great -- the market size and the profitability pool -- and the profitability pool. So, Swedish Match adds the component of the sales force, which is the in-store execution. Obviously, it would be nice to have them, but this is not something which is unique in a sense that -- you cannot make it or attain it organically, for example, right, or other options can be at the table as well. The uniqueness of an IQOS is again is the commercial engine, commercial activations. If you follow us closer, we have spent enormous effort in behind the consumer journey and automating, digitalizing all touch points with the consumers. And that\u2019s the value which we will be bringing. We\u2019ll have to invest, but the know-how is on our side.\nPamela Kaufman: And then, I have a question about the 90% threshold for the Swedish Match deal, which appears difficult to achieve in most circumstances. Would you consider lowering the threshold in the event that fewer shareholders tender? And what would be the challenges in operating the asset with a lower ownership stake?\nJacek Olczak: Well, we have asked for some understanding, not getting the questions on the Swedish Match deal, like the fact of life is, it is SEK 116 and the 90% acceptance level, okay? And this is where we see the value of Swedish Match, the maximum of the value to Swedish Match today, and I will not comment beyond this whole fact. I think, it is a fair market price, fair valuation of the company for the both, group of the shareholders, PMI shareholders, Swedish Match shareholders, both long term and short term, and we will not comment beyond this one.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Gaurav Jain with Barclays.\nGaurav Jain: A couple of questions from me. So, first is on the entire plan around IQOS commercialization in the U.S., and let\u2019s assume you are doing it standalone. So, you will have to hire, and I\u2019m looking at some of your competitors, which have a 10% share in the U.S. like Imperial. So, they have a few thousand employees. So, if you have to hire a few thousand employees and then you incur marketing investments, so should we model in like a few-hundred-million-dollar of losses in the first few years before you scale up IQOS to a big enough volume where it starts generating incremental EBIT? Much like you had when you commercialize IQOS around the world, I remember like between \u201815 and \u201817, you had like a few -- like $700 million or $1 billion kind of loss that you had identified at that time. So, is that something similar we should do as you commercialize U.S.?\nJacek Olczak: Yes. I mean, look, the directional -- you\u2019re right. I mean, obviously, building the infrastructure looking from a scratch requires several hundred thousands of employees now in the scheme of the 80,000 employees, which PMI has, it\u2019s not the first time that we\u2019re building an organization from scratch. And you\u2019re absolutely right that the initial years, couple of years will be on the laws as frankly speaking, we had with IQOS in every country in which we enter. And you\u2019re following us closely, you know that we have achieved on markets, the faster path to the breakeven that we had in the year one or two of our smoke-free journey versus what we\u2019re achieving today. So, it\u2019s a ton of learnings, it\u2019s tremendous learning and capability in our organization, as I call the internal know-how and the systems, et cetera, which we don\u2019t have to reinvent again. So, we know pretty well the blueprint. A lot of things have been attested, et cetera. So, U.S. market will enjoy or leverage that sort of the things. So, summer next year will come with the more visibility on how we see the spending and the path. I think in the release, we have said that the most logical -- based on our experience and the success on international, most logical milestone near term, so let\u2019s say, 2030\u2019s 10 [ph] share point of the market, which if we see where we are in other places and what we achieved six years after to date versus now I add the six years plus/minus to the current 2030, 10%, I think we will execute accordingly. We have -- and Emmanuel, in his remarks made it very clear. We\u2019ll fully stand behind, including monetary and the human resources to deliver the success -- is well overdue success of IQOS in the U.S.\nGaurav Jain: And a follow-up question on the BAT litigation at ITC, which they won, the patent dispute. So, -- look, so that prevents you from importing IQOS devices, which is why you are now setting up the domestic manufacturing facilities. But, can\u2019t BAT use those patent wins, because clearly, they have established, they have some strength in their patent, and go to a domestic U.S. court and also get injunctions against your selling of IQOS devices in the domestic market? So, I\u2019m trying to understand how do you frame this entire patent litigation even around your domestic IQOS manufacturing and commercialization sort of strategy.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Well, Gaurav, on that one, we have to clarify. One thing is the ITC process where indeed there was a decision from ITC. But otherwise, on the federal circuit, I would say, for the time being, there is rather success on our side. One of the family of patents that has been claimed by BAT on their case with IT was actually recognized as not valid in front of a U.S. court. So, I don\u2019t think that you can draw a parallel between what happened in the ITC and what is happening on the federal level in the U.S. And we believe that the domestic manufacturing is giving us a clear path and the capacity to reenter the U.S. market.\nGaurav Jain: Okay. And if I could just ask 1 follow-up on what you just said, the IQOS ILUMA device, does it bypass all these patents, which are under dispute?\nJacek Olczak: The case which we have with -- the ITC case with -- started by BAT is with regards to the IQOS 3.0. ILUMA is in a completely different path.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: My first question is on your guidance. Your Q3 came in better than expected, and you took up your full year currency-neutral revenue guidance. But I guess, I\u2019m trying to reconcile this with your lower guidance on IQOS. I guess, this implies you now expect stronger results in your combustible business and possibly greater device sales. So, could you walk through this for us, especially on device sales expectations in the second half, possibly ramping? And if there\u2019s a risk of retail inventory building that could potentially impact results next year?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes, Bonnie. So no, there is nothing to do with the device in the guidance. You\u2019re right. We have slightly been moving the bracket for the HTUs volume, not massively, were 90% to 92%, and we are now 89% to 91%. So they are still part of the bracket that is the same. Clearly, we see some compensation at the level of a very robust combustible business. I think, I\u2019ve been flagging that in detail in the presentation. And that is giving us this visibility on higher growth in volume than what we were anticipating so far, and we are raising the guidance to plus 2% to 3%. We have been raising the guidance for revenue as well with the low end of the bracket that has been raised to plus 6.5%. And then, we have the same adjusted EPS, notably because we see costs that are probably potentially a bit higher than what we anticipated a few weeks ago. So, that is giving us the same bracket for adjusted EPS. But in a nutshell, that is how the guidance is evolving.\nBonnie Herzog: Okay. Thanks for that. And then just my second question, I -- sorry, I have a follow-up question about the agreement you reached with Altria, maybe asked a little differently. I guess I\u2019m trying to get a sense of how you got comfortable with $2.7 billion payment to Altria, which is quite a large lump sum of money. This is to get your exclusive rights to IQOS back in the U.S. So, how confident are you that you\u2019re going to be able to reach this 10 share in the U.S. market by 2030, especially since it does feel like the ramp will now likely be slower, if you have to go it alone or even with Swedish Match? And then, finally, as it relates to this, how do you think about not being able to use the Marlboro brand name in the U.S. now?\nJacek Olczak: Yes. So, with regards to the confidence, Bonnie, is that -- look, this confidence beyond -- or behind IQOS is growing every year, every quarter. I mean, you see the results on the international markets and we have the markets when we -- slower markets, when we faster. But the potential for IQOS, the heat-not-burn is there, okay? So, if we look at the U.S., I don\u2019t think -- I cannot find the reasons why in the U.S. we cannot replicate to come close to the success of international. And the 10%, if you like, the first double-digit number, which we are obtaining after six years in any other geographies and taking into considerations that U.S. starting with IQOS 3 that we will be also working to bring faster the IQOS ILUMA to the U.S. and our international success has been built on IQOS 2.4, 2.4-plus. So, the U.S. is starting the journey with IQOS, the much better moment from a product perspective of our capability perspective, understanding this entire category that we\u2019ve been in our international markets. So, this is what the confidence is coming from. And the second question with regards to the Marlboro, IQOS TEREA in Japan is now by X factor bigger than the HeatSticks Marlboro. And this was the last market, which we still have been using a Marlboro trademark of our heat-not-burn consumables. And as you know, at the very beginning, six or so years ago in a few markets, I recall it was Switzerland and Italy, we started with Marlboro and very early in the journey, we have almost overnight, we branded that thing and we dropped the Marlboro from the brand, from the proposition. And I actually believe that we have a Marlboro in international, and this is a great brand, but on cigarettes. And I have no doubt today that we are on the path that we can make IQOS as iconic brand on a global basis as in the past we have made Marlboro. So, I don\u2019t see this as an impediment or bottleneck in our strategy in the U.S.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays.\nPriya Ohri-Gupta: First, I just had a quick administrative question. What is the U.S. dollar equivalent for the revised Swedish Match offer? Should we just use the current exchange rate, or would there be an adjustment for any hedging that might have previously been put in place? And then I have another follow-up.\nEmmanuel Babeau: I\u2019m not sure to understand your question, Priya. I mean, the offer is in Swedish krona, so we\u2019ll pay it in Swedish krona. Now, what we\u2019ve been importing is the fact that the price increase that we are offering today corresponds to the impact of the currency fluctuation since the day of the announcement in May between the dollar and the Swedish krona, noting that a significant portion of the cash flow generated by Swedish Match is in dollar. That\u2019s it. So, I\u2019m not sure to understand your question.\nPriya Ohri-Gupta: It was just whether -- so when you announced the transaction, the dollar amount would have been $16 billion. And you\u2019re still sort of close to that just given the FX move, but was there any incremental hedging that was put in place?\nEmmanuel Babeau: We can make our calculation. We can provide you with a number of shares of Swedish Match and you can make the calculation. So, in dollar terms, I think the amount is slightly lower. But again, please take into account the fact that Swedish Match is not 100% generating cash flow in dollars. Okay? So, you cannot just take the dollar amount at 100%, to be very clear.\nPriya Ohri-Gupta: That\u2019s helpful. And then, as we think about sort of the 10% share that you\u2019ve discussed getting to by 2030 in the U.S. market, how much of that includes contribution from ILUMA? I guess, as you put PMTA or submit the PMTA in the latter half of next year, what sort of time line are you assuming around that getting to market and getting nationalized?\nJacek Olczak: Well, I mean, we\u2019re planning to file for PMTA with ILUMA to FDA next year. So, as we\u2019ve seen recently, the factoring in the timing of outcome of dealing with FDA is a little bit of a challenge. But there will be -- ILUMA, obviously, in this 10%. I won\u2019t give you the number now how much of the 10% is hinging on ILUMA, but let\u2019s take it again differently. We have a few markets very successful, but still very few markets when ILUMA plays the role today in our portfolio. And if you look, for example, for the European Union, almost entirely, the success of six years in commercialization of IQOS is built on the IQOS 2.4, 2.4-plus and at 3, 3.1. So, these are the products which we have a relatively clear path to grow in the U.S. So, there will be ILUMA, but it\u2019s too early now to say how much of the 10% will be there. Obviously, for us, it\u2019s -- ILUMA offers benefits even further than the blade technology. But on the blade technology, this is where we are today, 6 years in PMI. So, I think we\u2019ll -- we don\u2019t have to solve that equation today.\nPriya Ohri-Gupta: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then, just final question for me. I think, as you discussed the inflationary pressure ramping from some of the contract renewals that you\u2019re going through right now on the input side, how should we think about that headwind? Is it fair to think of that sort of mid-single-digit rising to the high-single-digits? And then, in terms of cadence, is it fair to assume sort of the greatest effect of that being on the first half of calendar \u201823 and then sort of moderating into the back half as you start to lap some of that? Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Look, on the inflationary pressure, of course, very difficult to give a kind of definitive answer because this is a very fluid situation and with significant evolution. Today, if we assume that at a certain point in time, the inflation we are facing will be in line with the inflation that is seen in many countries. Yes, that would probably mean that the mid-single digit could go to high-single digit. It can be a bit more complex than that because, of course, it depends on which kind of element of inflation we are exposed to. But that could be in some areas an evolution for next year. Frankly, too early to say. And also too early to say when is going to be the climax of that. Is it going to be at the end of this year in terms of cost increasing, are we going to see more inflation through 2023? I think it\u2019s too early to say. Of course, for the -- I mean, we\u2019ll monitor the situation, but I would say energy price is energy price, but I mean there is not much we can do. We still need to buy energy. The answer for us is, of course, to react with price increase. And I think you have seen in our Q3, an acceleration of our price increase. We are getting at almost 5%, which is showing the capacity depending on what\u2019s going to be the environment and whatever it is, to mitigate the impact of what we\u2019re going to see on inflationary pressure with price increase.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s Q&A portion. I would now like to turn the program back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.\nJacek Olczak: So, thank you very much for your attention. We\u2019re very happy that we spent our review, especially in this very important moment for us that our key strategy focus -- strategic focus over the last good few months, if not longer, is how to find a much more clear and predictable path to the U.S. has been achieved towards the -- achieving the deal with Altria gaining the full control of IQOS. So, we\u2019re very happy that you spent this hour with us today. Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you. Talk to you soon.\nJames Bushnell: That concludes our call today. Thank you again for joining us. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations team. Thank you again and have a nice day.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s event. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jacek Olczak",
            "content": "Hi Chris, it's Jacek. Not really. If you look at the down trading type of a pressure, we still don't see really an acceleration of the tracks, right? So obviously, we see the Indonesia, Philippines under pressure. But it's not much really changed versus what we have seen before. Now, one could argue that in some geographies that the inflation has a bit of a lagging sort of evolution but nothing today. And you could see also from the shows of Marlboro, right, that we will look pretty strong on the premium propositions. Okay? Despite the fact that we're taking the pricing and there will be pricing -- more pricing to come. So -- I mean what stands behind the success of IQOS is really the front-end consumer interface, right? That's the commercialization aspect, which makes -- is one of the key elements of IQOS success, which we measure as the highest in the industry rates of conversion and adoption of IQOS and therefore, switching from cigarettes. Swedish Match doesn't have it, right? Swedish Match is the component of the sales force, which is essentially in store execution, but IQOS success hinges on that business-to-consumer component. So, in above scenario, obviously, that's the investment, which is front of us, but vis-a\u0300-vis a great -- the market size and the profitability pool -- and the profitability pool. So, Swedish Match adds the component of the sales force, which is the in-store execution. Obviously, it would be nice to have them, but this is not something which is unique in a sense that -- you cannot make it or attain it organically, for example, right, or other options can be at the table as well. The uniqueness of an IQOS is again is the commercial engine, commercial activations. If you follow us closer, we have spent enormous effort in behind the consumer journey and automating, digitalizing all touch points with the consumers. And that's the value which we will be bringing. We'll have to invest, but the know-how is on our side. Well, we have asked for some understanding, not getting the questions on the Swedish Match deal, like the fact of life is, it is SEK 116 and the 90% acceptance level, okay? And this is where we see the value of Swedish Match, the maximum of the value to Swedish Match today, and I will not comment beyond this whole fact. I think, it is a fair market price, fair valuation of the company for the both, group of the shareholders, PMI shareholders, Swedish Match shareholders, both long term and short term, and we will not comment beyond this one. Yes. I mean, look, the directional -- you're right. I mean, obviously, building the infrastructure looking from a scratch requires several hundred thousands of employees now in the scheme of the 80,000 employees, which PMI has, it's not the first time that we're building an organization from scratch. And you're absolutely right that the initial years, couple of years will be on the laws as frankly speaking, we had with IQOS in every country in which we enter. And you're following us closely, you know that we have achieved on markets, the faster path to the breakeven that we had in the year one or two of our smoke-free journey versus what we're achieving today. So, it's a ton of learnings, it's tremendous learning and capability in our organization, as I call the internal know-how and the systems, et cetera, which we don't have to reinvent again. So, we know pretty well the blueprint. A lot of things have been attested, et cetera. So, U.S. market will enjoy or leverage that sort of the things. So, summer next year will come with the more visibility on how we see the spending and the path. I think in the release, we have said that the most logical -- based on our experience and the success on international, most logical milestone near term, so let's say, 2030's 10 [ph] share point of the market, which if we see where we are in other places and what we achieved six years after to date versus now I add the six years plus/minus to the current 2030, 10%, I think we will execute accordingly. We have -- and Emmanuel, in his remarks made it very clear. We'll fully stand behind, including monetary and the human resources to deliver the success -- is well overdue success of IQOS in the U.S. The case which we have with -- the ITC case with -- started by BAT is with regards to the IQOS 3.0. ILUMA is in a completely different path. Yes. So, with regards to the confidence, Bonnie, is that -- look, this confidence beyond -- or behind IQOS is growing every year, every quarter. I mean, you see the results on the international markets and we have the markets when we -- slower markets, when we faster. But the potential for IQOS, the heat-not-burn is there, okay? So, if we look at the U.S., I don't think -- I cannot find the reasons why in the U.S. we cannot replicate to come close to the success of international.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Emmanuel Babeau",
            "content": "Thank you, James, and welcome everyone. Today marks a historic day in our journey towards a smoke-free future, with the certainty that we will have full control of IQOS, the world's leading smoke-free product in the United States, the world's largest smoke-free market from April 30, 2024. Indeed, today's agreement with Altria removes the potential of a protracted legal process to regain the U.S. rights to IQOS which Altria previously held, subject to performance milestones, until 2029. We have ambitious plans for the full-scale launch and rapid expansion of IQOS in the U.S. market as soon as we take over and efficient time during the transition period to put our commercial model and related organization and infrastructure in place using our wealth of experience from international markets. We see IQOS as the primary vector for establishing a leadership position in the U.S. smoke-free industry and it will be followed by the other products in our smoke-free portfolio. In this context, Swedish Match offers an immediate position in the oral segment, and mutually beneficial synergies at sales force level. However, should the offer fail, we can certainly build a robust sales force as part of our commercial deployment engine during the transition period. Under both scenarios we see an accelerated path to profitability with an attractive payback period on our IQOS investment, given superior U.S. unit economics and the absence of a legacy cigarette business. I will cover this in more detail later. With regard to Swedish Match, we announced this morning an update to our offer with our best and final price of SEK 116. Our updated offer retains a 90% acceptance condition, which is critical to allow us to capture the full potential of the combination. Now that we are close to the end of the offer period, the increased offer is primarily intended to fairly reflect the higher net value to us of the portion of Swedish Match's cash flows which are in U.S. dollars given currency movements since our initial offer was announced in May. Equity markets, the global economy and interest rates have also moved unfavorably since then. As such, we believe the updated price, with a premium of 52.5% to the undisturbed share price prior to the initial offer, strengthens the attractiveness yet further for Swedish Match shareholders while maintaining strong value creation for PMI shareholders. This is our best and final price and we hope to complete the transaction next month to achieve full ownership. Turning now to our Q3 earnings, we delivered another very strong performance this quarter, with HTU volumes ahead of our forecast, and robust growth in total volumes, market share and combustible net revenues. With adjusted operating income margins in line with expectations, this resulted in total Q3 adjusted diluted EPS of $1.53, close to our all-time quarterly high despite notable currency headwinds. IQOS' excellent performance continued, with plus 22% growth in pro forma HTU shipment volumes, a testament to the continued strengthening of our heat-not-burn portfolio and broad-based growth across key regions. IQOS ILUMA continues to drive growth in its launch markets. In combustibles, we delivered robust performance with Q3 organic pro forma net revenue growth exceeding plus 4%, driven by accelerated pricing of almost plus 5%. Cigarette shipment volumes were essentially stable and category share grew, supported by Marlboro, showcasing the resilience of the brand despite current economic conditions. Turning now to the headline numbers, our Q3 volumes grew by 2.3% on a pro forma basis, and by 0.6% in total, including Russia and Ukraine. Pro forma net revenues grew organically by plus 6.9% and by plus 6.7% for total PMI. Our total organic net revenue per unit grew by plus 4.5% on a pro forma basis and by plus 6.1% in total despite lower device revenues. This reflects the increasing weight of IQOS in our sales mix and a step up in combustible pricing. Our Q3 adjusted operating income margin declined organically by 100 basis points on a pro forma basis and by 90 basis points in total, consistent with our expectations. As previously communicated, this reflects the recovery in device volumes, the investments in launching ILUMA including initially higher unit costs, the impact of supply chain disruption, notably due to the war in Ukraine and increasing global inflationary pressures. Despite these headwinds, our strong top-line growth and ongoing cost efficiencies enabled us to outperform our previous currency-neutral guidance to deliver adjusted diluted pro forma EPS of $1.33, including unfavorable currency of $0.23, representing 8.3% currency-neutral growth. Including Russia and Ukraine, we delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $1.53. Our strong third quarter, combined with a robust H1, supported an excellent delivery for the year-to-date. I would highlight our strong pro forma volume growth of plus 3.4% and organic net revenue growth of plus 7.7%, again reflecting continued strong IQOS performance, pricing, and the recovery of the combustible business in many markets against a pandemic-affected comparison. Smoke-free net revenues made up around 30% of our year-to-date pro forma total, putting us on track to reach our ambition of over 50% by 2025. Our year-to-date operating income margin contracted organically by 110 basis points on a pro forma basis, driven by the factors mentioned previously. We remain on track to deliver cost savings of $2 billion over 2021-2023. $1.5 billion of gross savings have already been delivered, including over $200 million in Q3. This allows us to reinvest in the business and mitigate increasing inflationary pressures. Year-to-date currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS grew by plus 9.7% to $4.11 on a pro forma basis and by plus 8.8% in total to $4.59; an excellent performance. Now, let's turn to the pro forma full year outlook. Given the continued growth of IQOS and robust trends in combustibles, we are revising our top-line forecasts upwards to 2% to 3% growth in total shipment volumes, and 6.5% to 8% growth in organic net revenues. While our top-line outlook remains very strong, like many other global companies we are facing significant inflationary forces in the world economy, and this is reflected in our updated adjusted OI margin forecast. Inflation in our cost of goods remained mid-single-digit in the third quarter. However, inflationary pressures are growing as we renew pricing arrangements, notably for certain direct materials, wages, energy, and transportation costs. In addition, the very strong growth of ILUMA in Japan and other launch markets has an initial negative margin impact, given the higher weight of the consumables and increased cost of both the device and consumables, in the first 12 to 18 months of activation. As mentioned previously, the combination of strong demand, global supply chain disruption and the impact of cancelling induction HTU production in Russia, means our supply chain is not fully optimized. This has resulted in reduced productivity and a number of additional costs, including an approximate $300 million impact from a significant increase in the use of air freight. As a result, while we continue to expect a rebound in our Q4 adjusted OI margin, partly reflecting higher commercial investments in the prior year, we are now forecasting less expansion than previously expected, with pro forma adjusted organic operating income margin flat to slightly negative for the full year. Despite this change to margin expectations, our top-line momentum is strong and we continue to forecast pro forma adjusted diluted EPS growth of 10% to 12% for 2022. This translates into a pro forma adjusted diluted EPS forecast of $5.22 to $5.33, including an estimated unfavorable currency impact of $0.87 at prevailing rates, notably due to the euro and Japanese yen. There is a slide in the appendix with further detail on the estimated exchange rate impact. For total PMI, which assumes a full year contribution from Russia and Ukraine, we expect adjusted diluted EPS of almost $6, including an estimated $0.80 unfavorable currency impact. Lastly, given the continued success of ILUMA and the cancellation of TEREA production in Russia I just referenced, we are working to further accelerate our production of induction consumables. As we convert and transition capacity from blade to induction, we incur certain inefficiencies and limits on the availability of ILUMA HTUs. We are optimizing our inventory levels where possible to minimize any impact on consumer availability. However, these factors are a constraint on our shipments and we are updating our HTU shipment volume forecast to 89 billion to 91 billion units for the year. Importantly, this is a short-term supply dynamic. Consumer offtake trends remain strong and HTU in-market sales volumes are expected to further accelerate their growth to over 25% in Q4, while also growing sequentially compared to Q3. The cash generation capacity of our business remains exceptional, as shown through the challenges of recent years. Our balance sheet and cash flow remain strong. We delivered operating cash flow of $7.7 billion year-to-date, representing growth of 6.5% on a currency-neutral basis. Today we reconfirm our forecast of around $10.5 billion in operating cash flow for the full year, despite an estimated currency headwind of around $1.3 billion. This means we expect to deliver an excellent $22.5 billion over 2021 and 2022. Cash flow was flattered somewhat in 2021 by $0.5 billion from one-off impacts and the timing factors of certain cash flows which benefitted 2021 at the expense of 2022; and by a further $0.5 billion of working capital improvements. However, our 2022 forecast demonstrates underlying growth against this exceptional year. I would also like to highlight that U.S. dollar strength has a positive impact on our net debt, given that more than 60% of our financing is in euros, including derivative overlays. This serves to offset the impact on our earnings and, combined with strong cash generation, contributed to a $1.5 billion reduction in our net debt since December 2021, which is now below 1.6 times adjusted EBITDA on a 12-month rolling basis. This delivery highlights our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet, pay down debt, and invest in the growth of our business. In addition, we recently increased our annualized dividend for the 15th consecutive year, in line with our long-term commitment to return cash to shareholders. Turning back to our results. Our total pro forma shipment volumes increased by 2.3% for Q3 and 3.4% year-to-date, putting us comfortably on track to deliver total volume growth for the second consecutive year on both a pro forma and total PMI basis. Pro forma HTU shipment volumes grew by 21.9% for the third quarter and 15.8% year-to-date. While our shipments have been more volatile this year reflecting the current supply chain dynamics, HTU IMS growth has been consistently strong with 18.2% growth in Q3 and 19.2% year-to-date, with robust performance in the EU Region, Japan, and Low and Middle-Income markets. As I mentioned, we expect a further acceleration of IMS growth in Q4. Focusing now on combustibles, our portfolio delivered robust pro forma organic net revenue growth of 4.1% in Q3 and essentially stable pro forma shipment volume. Our pro forma pricing accelerated to 4.9% in Q3 as we progressively adjust to the inflationary environment. This reflects notable contributions from Australia, Germany, and the Philippines, and a positive quarterly variance from Indonesia for the first time since Q4 2019. We now expect full year pricing to be around 4%. Our pro forma share of the cigarette category increased by 0.2 points year-to-date. This was supported by Marlboro, where volumes grew by almost 4% for total PMI. With a premium position in a challenging consumer environment, this represents an impressive performance from the world's leading cigarette brand. Our leadership in combustibles helps to maximize switching to smoke-free products and we continue to target a stable category share over time, despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization. The positive combination of stable share in combustibles and the continued growth of IQOS positions us to deliver total market share growth over time. We captured 0.5 points of pro forma share gains in Q3 and 0.6 points year-to-date, with notable contributions from Italy, Indonesia, Japan, and Poland. Despite increasing competition in many markets, our leading share of the growing heat-not-burn category has remained stable since the start of the year at around 75% and grew sequentially in the third quarter. This remarkable achievement is supported by the increasing deployment of a 2-tier HTU portfolio, providing adult smokers with an expanding range of innovative and high-quality alternatives to cigarettes. PMI HTUs again strengthened their position as the second largest nicotine brand in markets where IQOS is present, with a sequential share gain in Q3 of 0.2 points to a record 7.7% share, excluding Russia and Ukraine. Focusing now on IQOS performance, we estimate there were approximately 19.5 million IQOS users as of September 30th, excluding Russia and Ukraine. This reflects growth of around 0.5 million users in Q3 and 2.7 million year-to-date. As shown on the right-hand side of this slide, the third quarter of each year typically experiences slower pro forma user growth due to seasonal factors. The growth of 0.5 million this quarter was very robust in a historical context, noting that the high growth in Q3 2020 benefited from a catch-up effect following the relaxation of COVID restrictions on retail locations and mobility. Importantly, we expect a strong acceleration in user growth in the fourth quarter of 2022. In the EU Region, smoke-free net revenues comprised almost 40% of regional net revenues year-to-date, with a number of markets well above 50%. This performance clearly shows the way towards our ambition to be predominantly smoke-free by 2025. Our EU third quarter HTU share increased by 2.0 points compared to Q3 last year to reach 7.3% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume. I would also highlight the 0.2-point sequential increase, which is a notably strong performance given the usual seasonality of the combustible market. Most importantly, adjusted IMS volumes continued to grow sequentially and reached a record high of 8.7 billion units on a four-quarter moving average. We expect IMS volume growth to continue in Q4, with a corresponding increase in market share. Please refer to the appendix for additional key city and market share data. With regard to regulation in the EU, we are encouraged by the increasing number of countries adopting multi-year fiscal frameworks with clear differentiation of smoke-free products, such as the recent legislation in Romania. We expect the proposal on the EU Tobacco Excise Directive to be published by year-end and hope for a similar approach. As a reminder, the Tobacco Excise Directive will require unanimous support for approval by all 27 EU member states. Now, let's focus on the performance of ILUMA in the EU region. ILUMA continues to drive user acquisition, the switching of existing users and accelerated category growth in both Spain and Switzerland. In Q3 both markets experienced another quarter of strong sequential IMS volume growth, with offtake exit volume of TEREA now the clear majority of HTU sales in both markets. We also launched ILUMA in Greece at the end of June with promising initial results and introduced the product to Portugal earlier this month. In Japan, the adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by 2.8 points versus the prior year quarter to 23.6%. As in the EU, Q3 last year saw an optical sequential share decline due to combustible seasonality, making the 0.7-point sequential increase this quarter a notable achievement. IMS again grew sequentially to reach a record high of 8.3 billion units on a four-quarter moving average. This was driven by the impressive performance of IQOS ILUMA and the continued growth in key cities such as Tokyo. The heat-not-burn category now represents over one-third of total tobacco in Japan, with IQOS increasingly driving this year's growth. IQOS ILUMA celebrated its first anniversary of the Japan national launch in September and continues to exhibit strong growth due to excellent conversion, consumer satisfaction, and retention rates. Our premium-priced TEREA HTUs continued to grow strongly in Q3 and strengthened their position as both the second largest nicotine brand and largest RRP brand in Japan, reaching an exit offtake share of 14.9%. Encouragingly, SENTIA HTUs have also grown rapidly since the initial launch in April and national expansion in mid-July, driving consumer acquisition in the mainstream price segment. We exited Q3 with over 25% HTU offtake share, a record high, and continue to see a long runway of growth in Japan over the coming quarters. In addition to strong IQOS gains in developed countries, we continue to see very promising growth in Low and Middle-Income markets which drove around 30% of the Company's pro forma HTU growth in Q3. Given the large size of these markets, the premium positioning of the existing IQOS portfolio and the relatively early stage of commercialization, this represents outstanding progress. Strong growth in IMS volumes continued, and the pro forma share of our HTU brands grew 0.9 points versus the prior year quarter to 2.8% in Q3, a robust performance, considering the impact of seasonality. This reflects success across many markets, with notable progress in Lebanon, where Q3 offtake share in Beirut increased by 7 points to 18%, and Egypt, where offtake share in Cairo is approaching 6%. Further key city data can be found in the appendix. We are also encouraged by recent positive regulatory developments in the Philippines where the government passed a new law clearly differentiating combustible and noncombustible tobacco products. Smoke-free products will be regulated separately, with different health warnings, permitted product testing or guided trials, and rules to be established for product communication and point of sale activities that will support the switching of adult smokers to better alternatives. In addition, the latest development from our smoke-free innovation pipeline is a new heat-not-burn device that is especially relevant for low- and middle-income markets. It is a simple, convenient, and affordable proposition, which can cater to local taste preferences without compromising on the reduced risk profile of the product. We are planning pilot city launches in Colombia and the Philippines during the fourth quarter, as we further expand our portfolio of smoke-free products to serve different consumer needs. As we continue to innovate, it's critical to integrate sustainability through eco-design principles, circularity, and efforts to minimize and manage post-consumer waste. Addressing the environmental impact of our products is a key pillar of our sustainability strategy, which is reflected in our sustainability index and forms part of our executive compensation scheme. Our approach to reduce waste related to cigarettes, RRP consumables, devices and packaging is covered in a report, case studies and campaign published last month and available via a dedicated microsite on pmi.com. For example, we are progressing well towards our 2025 aspirations of having at least 80% of our shipment volumes covered by markets with anti-littering programs in place for cigarettes and for over 1 million cumulative smoke-free devices to be refreshed or repaired. Moreover, during September more than 10,000 stakeholders from more than 60 markets joined cleanup initiatives around the world. I am proud of our ESG performance which continues to be recognized worldwide. Our 2021 Low-Carbon Transition Plan and our Business Transformation Strategy were recently nominated for sustainability prizes, and our Chief Sustainability Officer, Jennifer Motles, was nominated for CSO of the year at the World Sustainability Awards. Moving now to perhaps the most impactful news of today, we are delighted to announce that we will soon have full control of IQOS, the world's leading smoke-free product, in the United States, the world's largest smoke-free market. As previously communicated, following the ITC decision last year prohibiting the import of IQOS into the U.S., we have been in discussions with Altria to find the best path forward. PMI's priority has always been to find a solution that best positions IQOS to realize its full potential in the U.S., as quickly as possible. I am excited to report that we have now reached an outcome that achieves this goal. Let me start by briefly summarizing the key terms of the agreement. From April 30, 2024, PMI will have full control over the commercialization of IQOS in the U.S., allowing us to distribute and sell the product, and critically engage directly with adult tobacco users. As part of the agreement, we will pay a total cash consideration of around $2.7 billion to Altria. We believe this agreement represents excellent value to our shareholders, as with the previous agreement potentially stretching to 2029, this solution provides certainty by avoiding what could have been a protracted and uncertain legal process that would have severely held back the development of IQOS. It provides a clear near-term path to commercializing at scale in the U.S., with the unencumbered backing of PMI's full strategic and financial commitment to the product's success. IQOS is the world's leading smoke-free product, with remarkable and rapid growth achieved across a wide range of international markets. From a standing start in 2015, IQOS is already a $9 billion annual net revenue business, having created the attractive heat-not-burn category and driving its growth. The U.S. is the world's biggest accessible nicotine market by retail value. The estimated retail value of its growing smoke-free market is already around 60% of all international markets combined, excluding China. We have spoken before about our plans to bring a leading portfolio to the U.S. and we expect IQOS to be at the very core of our U.S. smoke-free future, just as it already is elsewhere. The U.S. opportunity for IQOS is particularly encouraging given the clear demand from American adult smokers for credible smoke-free alternatives to cigarettes. Moreover, current smoke-free products have had limited success in fully switching adult smokers away from cigarettes. In the U.S. there are ample opportunities to build adult smoker awareness and understanding of smoke-free product offers, something that is particularly true for IQOS given our MRTP authorizations. We are ready to invest behind IQOS to bring it to market at scale across the U.S., starting with full-scale launches in key cities and regions, with a plan to progress rapidly to national penetration. IQOS remains the only inhalable smoke-free nicotine product to have received a Modified Risk Tobacco Product Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. We know from our experience in over 65 markets worldwide that IQOS's appeal to adult smokers who have tried the product is strong, as demonstrated by high full switching rates. We have a strong commitment to build awareness and invest behind the category to drive product trial among American smokers. The true potential for IQOS in the U.S. is substantial, as illustrated by the double-digit national shares achieved in just a few years across a number of Asian, European, and other markets, all with varying demographic profiles and adult smoker taste preferences. We believe a volume share of 10% of cigarettes and HTUs by 2030 is very achievable, with potential to go much further. Importantly, the return on investment for IQOS in the highly profitable U.S. tobacco market is compelling. We estimate the total U.S. industry profit pool at over $20 billion, and with average unit margins on U.S. cigarettes more than 3 times greater than for the PMI average, the payback over the next few years on the consideration paid to Altria looks very attractive. As we do not have a legacy cigarette business in the U.S., the opportunity is purely incremental. This also reflects a current excise tax system with no differentiation for heated tobacco products versus cigarettes at the federal level, and differentials on a limited basis in only a handful of states, thus presenting a clear additional opportunity over time. We are already advanced in our plans for IQOS in the U.S., as we prepare for domestic manufacturing and for important regulatory submissions, including for IQOS ILUMA where we plan to file a PMTA in H2 2023. As mentioned previously, we target the first half of next year for the resumption of IQOS domestic supply, which will be available to Altria under our current arrangement up until PMI assumes full commercial responsibility in April 2024. Our proposed combination with Swedish Match would provide certain U.S. sales and distribution capabilities. However, in the case of failure we have a clear path forward for IQOS and the rest of our smoke-free portfolio. Indeed, the most critical parts of the IQOS commercial model center on converting adult smokers, rather than distribution. In addition, the U.S. has an established distribution and retail landscape, with a clear route-to-market. We therefore also have concrete plans to proceed autonomously in building fully controlled and managed U.S. sales and distribution capabilities over the next 18 months leading up to April 2024, in order to ensure a successful IQOS roll-out and the introduction of other smoke-free products should our Swedish Match offer fail. Indeed, we believe today's agreement is fundamental to unlock the U.S. smoke-free market. As we have shared previously, we expect the heated tobacco category to remain the largest and fastest growing in dollar terms internationally. While the e-vapor and, to a lesser extent, nicotine pouch categories have paved the way for smoke-free products in the U.S., we know that heated tobacco comes closest to replicating the experience that smokers enjoy, with higher conversion and very low unintended use. To conclude today's presentation, our business delivered strong third-quarter and year-to-date performance, despite some challenging headwinds, and we expect to deliver another excellent year of double-digit adjusted diluted EPS growth on a pro forma currency-neutral basis. Most impressive was the continued excellent IQOS performance, with strong shipment volume and IMS growth reflecting broad-based momentum in the EU region, Japan, and emerging markets. We remain excited by the promising results of IQOS ILUMA, our rich pipeline of smoke-free innovation, and plans for further launches of both ILUMA and VEEBA in the fourth quarter and in 2023. We continue to accelerate investment in our commercial programs, digital engine, and R&D for long-term growth, as well as behind a number of growth opportunities across categories and geographies. The return from such investments remains compelling, as demonstrated by the exceptional top- and bottom-line growth delivered over recent years. In addition to growth in smoke-free products, our combustible business continues to perform well, with organic net revenue growth and essentially stable pro forma shipment volumes. Despite accelerated pricing in the current inflationary environment, temporary margin pressure from inflation and supply chain inefficiencies is likely to continue in the coming quarters. Importantly, our underlying growth fundamentals remain strong and we look forward with confidence. We have secured our near-term access to the substantial U.S. opportunity for IQOS, also forming the backbone for introducing our broader smoke-free portfolio. We are now advancing on our plans to launch at scale with or without Swedish Match. And finally, we have increased the dividend every year as a public company, through the ups and downs of economic and currency cycles. We continue to be steadfastly committed to returning cash to shareholders, as we advance towards our ambition to become predominantly smoke-free by 2025. Thank you. And before we start the question-and-answer session, please note that we are not able to comment on our offer for Swedish Match beyond what has been announced. All materials related to the offer can be found on the website, smokefreeoffer.com. And Jacek and I, we are now more than happy to answer your questions. No, I don't think so, Chris. We are organically before ForEx down for the first nine months with a number of impacts that we described due to the situation, of course, of strong disruption on the supply chain coming from the war in Ukraine and the situation in Russia. We have, of course, some element, of course, attached to the development of IQOS ILUMA, and that is, of course, playing. We have a lot of air freight that is impacting the margin. So, you have a number of temporary elements that I've been with us since almost the beginning of the year, and that drove the operating margin down. I think that it will take a little bit of time for us to be removed. But we also have seen, for the first line, something that is going to obviously stay with us, which is the inflation. We are seeing an inflation level for the time being around mid-single-digit. It could strengthen further because when we look at the number of inflation in many countries, it is above this mid-single-digit numbers. As we've been saying, we are entering into the renewal of a number of contracts that protected us to some extent on the way we are buying energy and the number of components. So, that means that this part of inflation is going to stay. But in Q4, actually, with a more positive mix and some maybe one-off having a lower impact, we are expecting rather a better situation on margin evolution versus the first 9 months. So, that's the opposite. We expect the Q4 that should be in terms of margin evolution, better than the first nine months. Well, Gaurav, on that one, we have to clarify. One thing is the ITC process where indeed there was a decision from ITC. But otherwise, on the federal circuit, I would say, for the time being, there is rather success on our side. One of the family of patents that has been claimed by BAT on their case with IT was actually recognized as not valid in front of a U.S. court. So, I don't think that you can draw a parallel between what happened in the ITC and what is happening on the federal level in the U.S. And we believe that the domestic manufacturing is giving us a clear path and the capacity to reenter the U.S. market. Yes, Bonnie. So no, there is nothing to do with the device in the guidance. You're right. We have slightly been moving the bracket for the HTUs volume, not massively, were 90% to 92%, and we are now 89% to 91%. So they are still part of the bracket that is the same. Clearly, we see some compensation at the level of a very robust combustible business. I think, I've been flagging that in detail in the presentation. And that is giving us this visibility on higher growth in volume than what we were anticipating so far, and we are raising the guidance to plus 2% to 3%. We have been raising the guidance for revenue as well with the low end of the bracket that has been raised to plus 6.5%. And then, we have the same adjusted EPS, notably because we see costs that are probably potentially a bit higher than what we anticipated a few weeks ago. So, that is giving us the same bracket for adjusted EPS. But in a nutshell, that is how the guidance is evolving. I'm not sure to understand your question, Priya. I mean, the offer is in Swedish krona, so we'll pay it in Swedish krona. Now, what we've been importing is the fact that the price increase that we are offering today corresponds to the impact of the currency fluctuation since the day of the announcement in May between the dollar and the Swedish krona, noting that a significant portion of the cash flow generated by Swedish Match is in dollar. That's it. So, I'm not sure to understand your question. We can make our calculation. We can provide you with a number of shares of Swedish Match and you can make the calculation. So, in dollar terms, I think the amount is slightly lower. But again, please take into account the fact that Swedish Match is not 100% generating cash flow in dollars. Okay? So, you cannot just take the dollar amount at 100%, to be very clear. Look, on the inflationary pressure, of course, very difficult to give a kind of definitive answer because this is a very fluid situation and with significant evolution. Today, if we assume that at a certain point in time, the inflation we are facing will be in line with the inflation that is seen in many countries. Yes, that would probably mean that the mid-single digit could go to high-single digit. It can be a bit more complex than that because, of course, it depends on which kind of element of inflation we are exposed to. But that could be in some areas an evolution for next year. Frankly, too early to say. And also too early to say when is going to be the climax of that. Is it going to be at the end of this year in terms of cost increasing, are we going to see more inflation through 2023? I think it's too early to say. Of course, for the -- I mean, we'll monitor the situation, but I would say energy price is energy price, but I mean there is not much we can do. We still need to buy energy. The answer for us is, of course, to react with price increase. And I think you have seen in our Q3, an acceleration of our price increase. We are getting at almost 5%, which is showing the capacity depending on what's going to be the environment and whatever it is, to mitigate the impact of what we're going to see on inflationary pressure with price increase. Thank you. Talk to you soon."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management sessions, and the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of the question-and-answer from the investment community. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. James Bushnell, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.\nJames Bushnell: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2022 second quarter results. You may access the release on pmi.com. A glossary of terms, including the definition for reduced risk products or RRPs as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures and additional heated tobacco unit market data are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Unless otherwise stated, all references to IQOS are to our IQOS heat-not-burn products and all references to smoke-free products are to our RRPs. Growth rates presented on an organic basis reflect currency-neutral adjusted results, excluding acquisitions and disposals. Consistent with last quarter, figures and comparisons presented on a pro forma basis entirely exclude PMI\u2019s operations in Russia and Ukraine. As mentioned previously, starting in the second quarter of 2022, and on a comparative basis, PMI will exclude amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles from its adjusted results. Today\u2019s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements disclosure in today\u2019s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It\u2019s now my pleasure to introduce Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer. Over to you, Emmanuel.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, James. Welcome to you in your new role, and welcome, everyone. Before I begin, I want to reiterate our focus on supporting our employees and their families affected by the war in Ukraine and above all on the safety of our people. We continue to deploy pledge humanitarian support and additional benefits for our Ukraine employees. As previously announced, we intend to exit the Russian market in an orderly manner, as the complexities of continuing to operate in Russia increase such as supply chain challenges and financial and banking sector restriction. We continue to actively work on options for doing so in the context of an increasingly complex and rapidly changing regulatory and operating environment, including the requirement to obtain certain governmental approval for any transaction. Turning to our business. We demonstrated strong underlying momentum in the second quarter of 2022 with another quarter of positive volume supporting better-than-expected top and bottom line growth. Most impressive was the continued excellent IQOS performance and strong Q2 pro forma user growth of more than 1.1 million, demonstrating further sequential acceleration compared to Q1 as device limitation and COVID restrictions continue to ease. This reflects strong momentum in the EU region, Japan and developing market. Q2 RP pro forma net revenues grew by plus 11% despite the adverse shipment timing impact due to supply chain constraints highlighted last quarter, while HTU IMS volumes grew by plus 20%. IQOS ILUMA delivered further impressive results in its first three markets of Japan, Switzerland and Spain. The acceleration in category growth in these diverse geographies highlight the exciting future growth opportunity across the world, including in the latest launch market of Greece. In combustible, robust Q2 pro forma volume growth of plus 2.4% and organic net revenue growth of plus 4.2% were driven by Marlboro share gains stronger pricing and the continued recovery of the market. Maintaining leadership of the cigarette category allows us to maximize the switching of adult smokers to smoke-free alternatives and accelerate our transformation into a predominantly smoke-free business by 2025. We expect the strong underlying momentum of our business in H1 to continue, and we are from an organic growth outlook for the year. We are now well on track to deliver two consecutive years of volume growth, confirming our status as a growth company in terms of volumes, organic net revenues and margins. Despite a substantial currency headwind in 2022, we expect to deliver full year adjusted diluted EPS of around $6, including Russia and Ukraine. The proposed addition of Swedish Match would further boost our future financial profile. This is a value-creating offer for both set of shareholders with a compelling strategic and cultural fit, providing an additional opportunity to accelerate our smoke-free future. Turning to the headline numbers. Our Q2 volumes grew by plus 3% on a pro forma basis and by plus 1.1% in total, including Russia and Ukraine. Pro forma net revenues grew organically by plus 6.2% and by plus 5.3% for total PMI, reflecting both the continued strong growth of IQOS and the ongoing recovery of the combustible business in many markets against a pandemic affected comparison. As we anticipated and indicated previously, less unfavorable timing of cigarette shipment also played a role, notably due to replenishment of duty-free inventories. Our total organic net revenue per unit grew by plus 3% on a pro forma basis and by plus 4.1% in total despite the expected delay of HTU shipments to Japan as we manage through global supply chain disruption. This incorporates combustible pricing of plus 3.5% on a pro forma basis or almost plus 5% excluding Indonesia. Our Q2 adjusted operating income margin declined organically by 190 basis points on a pro forma basis and by 150 basis points in total. As expected and communicated in our Q1 quarterly results, this reflects four main factors: first, investment to further expand and match the speed of growth in our smoke-free portfolio. This includes the initial higher cost of ILUMA devices and HTUs and the transitory dilutive margin impact of higher device sales as we roll out ILUMA and replenish distribution channel as device constraint ease to support reaccelerating IQOS user growth. Second, the impact of supply chain disruption, notably due to the war in Ukraine, including around $80 million in additional air freight expenses. Third, inflation of around 4% in our cost of goods driven by the global pandemic recovery and exacerbated by the war, notably for certain direct materials, wages, energy and transportation costs. And last, a challenging prior year margin comparison, which included substantial cost of goods sold productivity savings. Despite these typical margin challenges, our robust top line growth and ongoing cost efficiency enable us to deliver plus 5.6% growth in pro forma currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS ahead of expectation to $1.32 and plus 3.8% growth for total PMI to $1.48, including Russia and Ukraine. Looking at the first half of the year now, our volumes grew by plus 4% on a pro forma basis and by plus 2.2% for total PMI. Pro forma revenues grew by plus 8.1% and by plus 7.1% in total, also driven by strong IQOS performance and the recovery of the cigarette category. We delivered organic net revenue per unit growth of plus 4% on a pro forma basis and plus 4.7% in total, again, reflecting the positive impact of growing HT volumes and pricing. Our H1 adjusted operating income margin contracted organically by 110 basis points on a pro forma basis and 90 basis points in total, driven by the factors mentioned previously. We expect better margin performance in H2, a topic I will review it shortly. Currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS grew by plus 10.4% to $2.79 on a pro forma basis and plus 9.2% in total to $3.06, an excellent performance given the circumstances. Reflecting this strong momentum, we are raising our guidance for 2022. With strong IQOS growth and robust trends in combustible, we foresee an acceleration in our currency-neutral growth expectation relative to our previous forecast. First, we now expect to grow our total pro forma shipment volume by plus 1.5% to plus 2.5% for 2022, achieving another year of volume growth. For pro forma net revenue, we expect to deliver between plus 6% and plus 8% organic growth as compared to the plus 4.5% to plus 6.5% announced previously, despite a greater-than-anticipated drag from hyperinflationary accounting in Turkey. With a strong recovery in device volume, the increasing contribution of ILUMA with initially higher unit cost and ongoing global inflation, we are narrowing our forecast for pro forma adjusted organic OI margin expansion to between zero and plus 50 basis points. We are also raising our growth outlook for pro forma currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS to between plus 10% and plus 12%. This reflects a range of $5.23 to $5.34, including an estimated unfavorable currency impact of $0.80 at prevailing rates notably due to the euro and Japanese yen. We'll include a slide in the appendix with further detail on this estimated impact. For total PMI, which assumes a full year contribution from Russia and Ukraine, we expect adjusted diluted EPS of $5.90 to $6.05, reflecting similar dynamic to the pro forma basis and including an estimated $0.69 unfavorable currency impact. Please note our 2022 forecast assumes no contribution from the proposed combination with Swedish Match, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, subject to Swedish Match shareholder acceptance and the necessary regulatory approvals. The outlook for IQOS growth is excellent, and we now expect to deliver full year pro forma HTU shipment volume of 90 billion to 92 billion units, representing the upper half of our previous forecast range. With growth momentum very strong, the main constraint for not further raising our HTU volume target is our production capacity, notably for ILUMA HTUs due to their outstanding initial success and the cancellation of production in Russia as we convert existing production line for induction consumable. We continue to expect excellent HTU growth in the coming quarters with a progressive improvement in ILUMA HTU capacity through the first half of 2023. We are prioritizing ILUMA launch market accordingly with further launches plan in Q4 as communicated previously. A notable further update to our outlook is an increase in our operating cash flow forecast to around $10.5 billion as compared to around $10 billion previously despite notable currency headwinds. This includes our accelerated pro forma earnings growth forecast and an assumed full year contribution from Russia and Ukraine. We delivered robust operating cash flow growth in H1 of plus 14%. And as shown through the challenges of recent years, the cash generation capacity of our business remains exceptional. While flatted somewhat in 2021 by favorable timing and one-off impact, our revised full year forecast demonstrates underlying growth against this exceptional year after also accounting for higher inflation driven working capital requirements and currency. This underlines our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet, pay down debt and invest in the growth of our business. Our net debt of $23 billion at June 30, 2022, decreased compared to both June and December 2021, despite H1 capital expenditure of $0.5 billion and ongoing dividend payment. Our commitment to our progressive dividend policy is unwavering and we look forward to the additional cash flow, the proposed combination with Swedish Match would bring. We also continue to expect around $1 billion in full year capital expenditure. Moving now to the pro forma outlook for the second half. We expect to deliver strong top line growth, organic adjusted OI margin expansion and further acceleration in bottom line growth. For Q3, we expect mid-single-digit organic top line growth driven by IQOS with around $22 billion in pro forma HTU shipment volumes. While there is a tougher comparison for cigarette and a modest negative impact expected from shipment timing, we expect combustible volume trends to remain resilient by historical standards. Net revenue growth will also continue to be impacted in both Q3 and Q4 by the shift to hyperinflationary accounting in Turkey. While the temporary cost headwinds in Q2 are expected to ease somewhat in the third quarter, we expect this to be broadly offset by a step-up in smoke-free commercial and R&D investment as compared to a device constraint in Q3 2021. This results in an expected Q3 pro forma adjusted diluted EPS range of $1.23 to $1.28, including an estimated adverse currency impact of $0.24 at prevailing rates. We expect a strong Q4 with a rebound in HTU shipment volume due to phasing to the most pronounced as HT capacity constraint improve. The H2 recovery in our pro forma adjusted OI margin is also expected to be Q4 weighted. Turning back to our results. Pro forma HTU in-market sales volume grew strongly by plus 20% for both the second quarter and the first half, notably driven by strong performance in the EU region. As expected, Q2 IMS pro forma growth was significantly ahead of shipment volume growth reflecting the later timing of shipments I mentioned earlier. Our total pro forma shipment volume increased by plus 3% for Q2 and plus 4% for H1. As I touched on earlier, this put us well on track to deliver total volume growth for the second consecutive year on both a pro forma and total PMI basis. With the impressive performance of IQOS, heated tobacco units comprised 12.6% of our pro forma shipment volume in H1 or 14% in total despite the anticipated HTU shipment timing impact in Q2. Our sales mix is also changing rapidly as we aim to become a majority smoke-free company by 2025. Smoke-free net revenues made up almost 30% of our pro forma total and exceeded 30% for total PMI in the first half of the year. IQOS devices accounted for approximately 5% of the $4.2 billion of pro forma H1 RRP net revenues. This reflects higher device volume at a lower average price than last year as we expand our device portfolio with VEEV and ILUMA and price ladder, our blade device portfolio in preparation for the launch of premium position in ILUMA. The positive momentum of IQOS continues and is further accelerating in many geographies, providing a powerful driver of revenue and margin growth. We delivered organic growth of plus 8.1% in H1 pro forma net revenues and shipment on growth of plus 4%. This reflects the twin engines driving our top line in addition to volume. The first is pricing led by combustible. The second is the increasing mix of RRPs in our business at higher net revenue per unit, which continued to deliver substantial growth. This is an increasingly powerful driver as our transformation accelerate. Let's now turn to the drivers of our H1 pro forma adjusted OI margin which contracted organically by 110 basis points. Pro forma gross margin decreased by 280 basis points organically, reflecting the factors I mentioned previously, as we invest in our smoke-free business and manage temporary supply chain disruption and cost inflation. This margin headwind was partially offset by better pro forma adjusted marketing administration and reserve costs, which improved by 160 basis points organically. This was driven by the positive operating leverage of RRP growth and successful cost efficiency program where we generated around $420 million in gross cost savings, of which approximately $170 million came from COGS productivity and over $250 million from SG&A. With more than $1.2 billion of savings realized by this halfway point, we are well on track to deliver cost savings of $2 billion for 2021, 2023. This allows us to reinvest in top line growth and mitigate inflationary pressures while continuing to deliver margin expansion. We continue to accelerate investment in our commercial programs digital engine and R&D for long-term growth as well as a number of growth opportunities across categories and geographies. As reflected in our full year outlook, we expect our operating margin trajectory to improve in the second half of the year as temporary headwind and tough comparison in. Focusing now on combustible, our portfolio again delivered growth in pro forma volume and organic net revenue in Q2. Our pro forma shipment volume grew by plus 2.4% against a pandemic affected comparison notably driven by Indonesia, Poland and Turkey. In addition, we saw a continued recovery in international duty-free outside Asia as passenger traffic increases. Pro forma combustible pricing of plus 3.5% was slightly ahead of our expectations. And while we remain cautious on the economic outlook, the pricing environment has been gradually improving. We expect to deliver a similar level of pricing for the full year. Our leadership in combustibles helps to maximize switching to smoke-free product and both the positive Q2 and H1 segment share demonstrates the strength of our portfolio. We continue to target a stable category share over time despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization. This year marks the 50th anniversary of Marlboro becoming the world's leading cigarette brand. With the return of social consumption occasion, Marlboro volumes grew plus 7% year-over-year in H1, with category share again surpassing 10% on a pro forma 12-month rolling basis. Of course, our long-standing success in building Marlboro's brand equity is the strength we are now -- smoke-free product as we make excellent progress with IQOS as the undisputed global smoke-free leader. The positive combination of a stable share in combustible and the continued growth of IQOS position us to deliver total market share growth over time. We capture plus 40 basis points of pro forma share gain in Q2 including gains in duty-free, Italy, Japan and Turkey. Moreover, PMI HTU strengthened their position as the second largest nicotine brand in markets where IQOS is present with a 7.5% share, excluding Russia and Ukraine. Moving now to IQOS performance. We estimate there were approximately 19 million IQOS users as of June 30 on a pro forma basis. This reflects very strong growth of over plus 1.1 million users in Q2 and plus 2.2 million in H1, a record first half high on this basis. The acceleration of IQOS user growth compared to both Q1 and last year was driven by the reactivation of acquisition and retention program in many markets as device supply constraint receded as well as the impressive start of IQOS ILUMA. While device supply constrained has eased in recent quarter, this is largely due to the success of our own proactive effort. The global supply of semiconductors remain tight, and we continue to closely monitor and manage the situation. In the EU region, we are now approaching the milestone of 9 million IQOS users, reflecting stepped-up commercial activities to drive acquisition and retention, along with the launch of ILUMA in Switzerland and Spain. Our second quarter HTU share increased by plus 1.6 points to 7.1% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume. As noted in prior years, sequential share compared to Q1 was affected by the usual seasonality of the combustible market with the additional element of a strong year-over-year combustible recovery this quarter. Most importantly, IMS volume continued to exhibit robust sequential growth, and we expect this to continue in the second half. The strong performance includes excellent user and volume growth across the region with notable contribution from Italy and Poland. Now to give some further color on our progress in the region. This slide shows a selection of the latest key city of Texas in Q2. Despite the denominator effect of the combustible category I just mentioned, share results remain very strong. Most impressive is Venus, the first city in the world to surpass 40% share while Athens, Budapest and Rome are in the mid- to high 20s. Elsewhere, we are especially pleased by the results in London, Vienna and Zurich. In Japan, IQOS ILUMA is driving -- and our share of market continues to increase in key cities such as Tokyo. Most importantly, our IMS volume trends remained strong with continued sequential growth. As indicated last quarter, Q2 shipments were lower due to timing factors and should recover in the second half with a weighting towards Q4. The adjusted share for our H2 brands increased by plus 1.9 points to a record 22.9% in Q2 despite seasonality. While we are very pleased with these results, our share performance could have accelerated even further. The combustible category was notably resilient in the quarter and our rollout of mainline price entire HTUs for use with ILUMA was slightly slower than initially planned. However, early results were encouraging is designed to cater to its consumers switching to ILUMA and more price-conscious legal-age smokers. We also observed an increase in legal-age users switching from low price competitive product. We estimate users of competitive offering to have less average daily consumption due to lower full conversion, which we believe ILUMA should improve over time. The heat-not-burn category now represents around 1/3 of total tobacco in Japan with IQOS increasingly driving this year's growth. In addition to strong progress in developed countries, we continue to see very promising IQOS growth in low and medium income market. The pro forma share of our HTU brands in the 28 such markets launched by December 31, 2021, continued to grow and reach 2.9% in Q2, reflecting sustained growth in IMS volume. Given the large size of this market, the premium positioning of the existing IQOS portfolio and the relatively early stage of commercialization, this represents outstanding progress. A prime example of this are Lebanon where Q2 of take share in Beirut increased by plus 8.1 points to 17.4%, and Egypt where off-take share in Cairo reached around 5% after launching less than one year ago. Other notable successes include the recently launched market of Morocco and Tunisia, as well as Georgia, Jordan, North Macedonia and the Philippine despite pandemic restriction in Manila. Moving now to IQOS ILUMA, which continued to drive increased conversion and retention rate across initial launch market. In Japan, ILUMA continued to exhibit strong growth with premium priced TEREA HTUs growing rapidly to become the second largest tobacco brand, reaching an off-take share of 14.6% within nine months of national launch. Encouragingly, SENTIA off-take share has already surpassed the level of prefectures covering around 45% of industry volume. The expansion of our device portfolio with ILUMA 1 in Q1 has also seen robust traction with legal smokers. We exited Q2 with a record high of tech share and continue to see a long runway of growth in Japan for ILUMA over the coming quarters. ILUMA and TEREA HTUs also continue their super start in Spain and Switzerland. We launched ILUMA in Spain in March 2022 with very positive initial results, notably in key cities such as Barcelona and Madrid. Sequential IMS volumes grew by 27% in Q2. TEREA exited the quarter, making up over 50% of HTU sales only four months after commercialization and our national HTU share has grown to plus 1.7%. This is especially encouraging as Spain has been a market where regulatory restriction had limited the speed of IQOS growth. In Switzerland, the demand for ILUMA remains very strong. IMA's volume continued to grow sequentially, increasing plus 13% in the second quarter. A significant proportion of existing users have upgraded to ILUMA and the off-take exit volume of TEREA now exceeds 70% of our HTU sales. We continue to expand our global smoke-fee portfolio through our rich pipeline of innovation. We launched ILUMA in Greece in late June with further market launches planned for Q4. With regard to our new heat-not-burn device tailored to low and middle income market, we continue to plan pilot launches in the fourth quarter, further expanding our portfolio to serve different consumer needs and segment the market. In e-vapor, IQOS VEEV continued to deliver encouraging results, and for example, is now the established number two closed-pod brand in Italy with off-take share growing sequentially to around 20%. This is a premium proposition with an average price premium to competitive devices of 20% to 30% as we pursue differentiated and profitable category leadership position over time. In Q2, we expanded into three additional geographies, including France, and are now present in 10 markets. The latest addition to our e-vapor portfolio is the VEEBA disposable device. Responsibly marketed disposable e-vapor product can play an important role as a convenient hassle-free entry into the smoke-free category for legal-age smokers. VEEBA was recently launched in Canada with nine varieties. Our geographic expansion of smoke-free products also continued in Q2 with the launch of IQOS in Bahrain. Of course, the biggest potential near-term addition to our smoke-free portfolio is the proposed combination with Swedish Match. This would deliver a major acceleration in our transformation to becoming a smoke-free company. The visions of our two companies are aligned in working towards a smoke-free future without cigarette and would create a global smoke-free champion. If completed, we would have a comprehensive global smoke-free portfolio with leadership position in heat-not-burn and the fastest growing category of oral nicotine with potential for accelerated international expansion. Another competing rationale for this deal is a large, attractive and growing U.S. smoke-free market. Swedish Match as the leading nicotine pouch franchise, with ZYN, and a substantial U.S. operational platform, which would help us unlock the significant opportunity across other more categories over the coming years. This would be a strong strategic and cultural fit, offering significant shareholder value creation over the medium and long term. As stated in the offer document published on June 28, the waiting period for the transaction under the U.S. antitrust process has expired, meaning that we have satisfied our requirement in the U.S. to proceed with the transaction. We expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter of this year, subject to Swedish Match shareholders acceptance and the necessary regulatory approvals. Moving to sustainability, I want to first draw your attention to our 2021 integrated report published in May, which outlines our new sustainability strategy and ESG performance in detail as we continue to transform for good. Included in the report is our new sustainability index comprised of 19 KPIs across our most material sustainability issues. The index is weighted towards product transformation and now represents 30% of our long-term performance-based equity executive compensation. The definitions, methodology and scope of each of these KPIs are included in our recently published ESG KPI Protocol, providing further transparency on how we define success and major ESG performance. With regard to tackling climate change, I am delighted to report that the science-based target initiative as today validated our 2040 net-zero target. The initiative also revalidated our near-term 2030 target for reducing greenhouse gas emission and our new 2025 target for 15% of our suppliers by spend to have their own Science-Based Target by 2025 a very positive development, given that Scope 3 remains the most challenging aspect of any company decarbonization strategy. To support the achievement of these targets, we are accelerating progress to decarbonize our chain, and we have made eight more factory carbon neutral this year, more than doubling from last year and placing us on track to meet our goal of all factories by 2025. Finally, product health impact remains one of our most critical ESG priorities. There is a growing body of scientific and real-world evidence of the substantial risk reduction potential of smoke-free product compared to smoking. We continue to support policy and fiscal framework that recognize a positive impact tobacco harm reduction policy can have on public health. Recent examples include a further multiyear tax plan with differentiated treatment for smoke-free products in Romania and statement from the Belgian Superior Health Council on the whole e-vapor product can play in switching adult smokers away from cigarettes. To conclude today's presentation, we have delivered a strong first half despite some challenging headwinds, placing us well on track to deliver robust volume growth and an accelerated currency-neutral pro forma financial performance in 2022. We remain excited by the promising results of IQOS ILUMA. Increased consumer satisfaction is driving higher retention and conversion, and we look forward to further market launches later this year. Our combustible business continues to perform well with pro forma volume and organic net revenue growth, maintaining our share of market over time despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization allows us to accelerate further switching of smokers to better alternative and to invest for long-term growth in the development of innovative wellness and health care product will seek to deliver a net positive impact on society. We continue to enrich our pipeline of smoke-free innovation, such as ILUMA and VEEBA to expand and grow across new and existing category and geography. We are raising our pro forma growth guidance for the full year and expect to deliver around $6 in total adjusted in total adjusted diluted EPS, including Russia and Ukraine despite currency headwinds. Importantly, with an excellent 2021 performance and our strong 2022 outlook, we now expect to comfortably exceed our 2021-2023 minimum CAGR target on a pro forma basis of more than plus 5% in organic net revenue growth and more than plus 5% in currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth. Our ambition to become a majority smoke-free business by net revenue in 2025 also remains fully intact. We are confident in the rapid pace of our transformation. Finally, we continue to be steadfastly committed to returning cash to shareholders. Our top priority for capital allocation remain reinvestment in the business and our progressive dividend policy, underpinned by strong cash flow generation. Thank you and we are now more than happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Pamela Kaufman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nPamela Kaufman: I wanted to get a sense for what's contributing to the strong IQOS new user momentum that you've experienced in the last two quarters. Is there anything that you're doing differently? And where are you adding these users geographically? How much is driven by ILUMA versus prior IQOS devices? And then related to that, what do you estimate new user growth would be if you were not constrained by production capacity?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thanks, Pamela. So we are obviously -- and I said it very pleased with the performance of IQOS, and that is certainly being reflected in the very strong user growth of more than 1.1 million in the second quarter. We said that for H1, it's a record growth. The good news is that we are really growing across geographies. So of course, we have a number of countries such as Italy, Poland, Japan, because their size, of course, they contribute more in the quarter. But the reality is that we see very good trends across geographies. And I could mention countries such as Romania, Portugal, Hungary, I mean, these are all countries of smaller size but where the growth is really impressive. So I think it's a tribute to the fact that IQOS is making some clear customer expectation, the fact that people realize all the benefits they can get by switching from combustible cigarettes to the IQOS product. There is certainly ILUMA contributing. But as you know, we are unfortunately today, limited in the number of geographies where we propose ILUMA. It's Japan Switzerland and Spain. We've been launching Greece. So that is certainly in this country, helping the performance. But to be very clear, the performance is across the board, as I said, and including country where we haven't launched yet ILUMA. So certainly, we are improving the way we deliver a great customer experience, including digital customer, how we contact smokers, how we get in touch with them, how we start the dialogue, how we explain the benefit of IQOS and how we are leading them in the journey from moving away from combustible products to IQOS. So no doubt, we continue to improve our commercial engine, and that is helping. There is probably the impact of awareness, visibility that is growing. There are markets where when you start to reach a certain market share, IQOS become visible, more visible, you go in bars, you go in events, you go in social gathering, you see more and more people, and that triggers what we call organic growth, people who wants to discover by themselves about IQOS. They want to learn, friends explaining how it works and why they really enjoy IQOS. We are also accelerating innovation. We have been proposing new devices. We are proposing new type of references. So, we are enlarging the choice and that make probably IQOS even more desirable and attractive. So that's really, I think, all the powerful driver behind the success of IQOS. Now if I focus on ILUMA and what is the potential with more ILUMA capacity, we see it in the three markets where we have been launching. ILUMA is resolving the remaining pain point that was -- that are existing on the previous version of IQOS. It's certainly coming with a great customer experience. It is increasing the conversion, the loyalty. We expect it to increase the average daily consumption as well and to significantly reduce our [indiscernible]. We see the customer Net Promoter Score improving in the countries. So that is obviously bringing more momentum in the country where we are launching ILUMA. And I think we should see it as a kind of second stage of the rocket that we are going to launch in the various countries to sell IQOS even higher, and that we expect in the various countries where we're going to launch in the coming quarters.\nPamela Kaufman: That's very helpful. I also wanted to get a sense for how you would characterize your current appetite for additional acquisitions in the near-term in light of the Swedish Match transaction. There are additional assets for sale in the U.S. market. Are you in a position to consider more acquisitions?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Today, we are focusing on Swedish Match. The time line is the one we were expecting at the beginning. We continue to expect the closing of the transaction in Q4, of course, subject to Swedish Match shareholder acceptance. Nothing has changed. We are focusing on that. Am I closing the door in the future on other things that would further accelerate our journey to become a leading and successful smoke-free company? No. But clearly, the priority and the focus today is on Swedish Match.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBonnie Herzog: I have a question on your pro forma adjusted OP margin in Q2. It declined on an organic basis. And you did highlight that the drag on your margins, at least partly was from the higher cost of ILUMA devices and then HTUs. And then you also lowered your full-year OP margin guidance. So just hoping you could give us a sense of how long margins could be negatively impacted, I guess, from the rollout of ILUMA. And just based on your FY '22 guidance, which does imply lower year-over-year EPS growth in the second half, I assume the drag on margins could be a key driver of this in the second half, but I just wanted to verify that? And just kind of thinking out into 2023, should the drag sort of ease? Or will that continue as you keep pushing on ILUMA?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes. Thanks, Bonnie for the question. So I mean, that's true that in H1, we've seen a number of headwinds on the margin. Needless to say that inflation, of course, is one. And we said that we are seeing around 4% inflation on our input cost. So I guess it's probably lower than inflation that we see in many countries, but that's significant. Obviously, we have costs that are coming from the disruption in the supply chain, notably coming from the war in Ukraine. We have a dramatic acceleration of air freight that is, of course, temporary. We're not going to keep air shipping on the long term. But during a period of time, we need to do that, and it's very costly at the time where the cost of freight is globally, not only for air but globally going up. So we are obviously being impacted. So that is having an impact here. And then there is a launch of ILUMA at the beginning, notably in Japan, where we had a very, very strong investment, which was really important to make on the device. And we have two devices now offering -- three device, actually, three models in Japan, and the strong volume in device has an impact on the margin level. On top of that, we said it since the beginning, we don't start the launch of ILUMA with optimized cost and weight on TEREA and on SENTIA. And that is coming at the beginning with a negative impact on margin which something that is temporary as well. So we expect in the course of 2023 seems to gradually improve. So inflation is not temporary. I think for the rest, a lot of the headwinds that we are seeing in H1 are temporary, and there will be a recovery in the future. I'm not able at that stage and we do that, of course, as we are gaining visibility to phase it in the coming quarter, but that's certainly what we that's what we are expecting. And then clearly, for H2, we are expecting an improvement on the margin. Certainly, that would be skewed to a large extent to Q4, but already the deterioration in Q3 on the gross margin would be lower, but there will be more investment as we know we are just following the growth, and we are putting the right level of investment to cope with the growth. Q4, we'll be clearly seeing a better improvement with the better mix. Remember, we've been impacted also on the margin by the fact that the volume that we should have been shipping and it should have been the P&L to Japan, and that are having a very nice margin are not in the P&L. And so of course, it's another one-off that was impacting H1, but we will have the compensation in H2. So, yes, difficult beginning of the year, it doesn't mean that everything will be back to normal in H2. That will be still with some headwind. But clearly, most of what we are facing is temporary, and they will be over time, a recovery on the margin.\nBonnie Herzog: Okay. That all makes sense. And yes, definitely a lot of moving parts. So that was helpful. And then just my second question is on your proposed acquisition of Swedish Match, I guess, could you give us a little more color on where things are? And then maybe what you see as potential risks of this transaction not happening? I guess I'm asking, thinking about the activist involvement other words, I guess, I'd like to hear how committed are you to this transaction? And how much flexibility do you have in terms of your leverage? I don't think you have a a target leverage ratio, but you've stated in the past you want to maintain your investment-grade ratings. So just maybe wanted to get a sense from you of what the rough, I guess, threshold for that leverage would be to maintain that.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Bonnie. What I can tell you on Swedish Match is, first of all, to repeat that we have cleared the U.S. requisite in terms of regulatory approval. So that is behind us. For the rest, the processes are still ongoing in several jurisdictions according to plan. And we are confirming the fact that we expect what we said in beginning closing in Q4, of course, subject to Swedish Match shareholder acceptance. And here, I would like to reiterate the fact that we believe that this is a very compelling offer for Swedish Match shareholder. Can I remind everybody that we offered a 40% for the premium at the time of the announcement in May, since then, the markets have been quite volatile, most of them going down, and that this offer has been approved by the Board of Swedish Match, which was confirming the fact that they thought it was compelling for their shareholders. So that's what I have to say on Swedish Match. And I have no other comment to make.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Chris Growe with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nChris Growe: I just had a question for you first on the timing of shipments across the second half. You've talked about the -- just over 2 billion sticks that shifted to the second half of the year. Does that shift mostly to the fourth quarter as we're thinking about your guidance for IQOS shipments in 3Q versus what's implied for the fourth quarter?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes, Chris, if I can try to help you, what we expect in Q3 is shipment to be much more in line with the underlying growth that we have seen on the IMS in H1, which was around 20%. So that's what we expect in shipment, but we don't expect the recovery of the shipments that have been missing in H1. We expect this recovery in Q4, where we continue to expect very strong dynamism of IQOS consumables. But then the shipment will be in Q4 above IMS to broadly align for the year, shipment and IMS. So that is the phasing that we expect for the year.\nChris Growe: Okay. And just one other question on relation to device sales. They've been a little elevated here as you had more availability. Does that remain elevated even in, say, the first half of '23 as you continue to build your availability of devices? And is that the right time line to think about the point where you'll have, let's call it, full availability of devices is in the first half of '23 based on the chip shortage?\nEmmanuel Babeau: I think you have two elements, Chris, here. The first one, remember, we had some constraint on device availability that started in Q2, some impact in Q3 and last year. So of course, there is an increase in the device level this year based on low comps. So that's the first element. And I think it's really important to realize how important it is to make sure that smokers can have access to IQOS device to get converted. So I think it's important that we make commercial effort here. And I think we're doing that well. And we see that our device versus maybe some device from the competition is clearly getting a better conversion. On top of it and then the second element, it is clear that with ILUMA, there is a wave of replacement. So, we see in the markets where we launched ILUMA, a rapid replacement of existing IQOS blade device by IQOS ILUMA. And that -- this wave of replacement is creating a very strong one-off acceleration in the level of device. When people will be equipped when the core consumer will be equipped that will be behind us, but we have to go through that. And that is having, again, on a temporary basis, a negative impact on the margin.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Vivien Azer with Cowen. Your line is now open.\nVivien Azer: So my first question has to do with the proposed elimination of menthol variants in the EU for heat-not-burn products. Could you please offer some color on your menthol mix in that geography, and then secondly, an outlook on the timing of that proposal? Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Look, I'm not sure we disclosed the component of menthol. Of course, that's a minority of our business. What I can say about that is that we have to understand that this is a move in application from the TPD in Europe. So it's not a decision. It's an application based on the TPD of 2014, which in certain circumstances was planning for a kind of automatic ban to be implemented. Now this still needs to be approved by the parliament and by the European Council that will be in front of these two bodies later on in 2022, and we'll see what is the final decision. To be very clear, it already has happened on a combustible business with almost no impact or very limited impact. So, the consumer reorganize their taste and they switch to other products, but very limited impact. And therefore, it isn't clear that this will have a meaningful impact if it happens on our heat-not-burn business. In addition to that, we believe that we have superiority in our tobacco taste versus competition, and that's the superiority of our technology with IQOS versus the technology of the competition. So that will mean if we are left with tobacco taste that our product will look great versus competition for people who may decide to go for new product, if they have to abandon on flavor. So we are, of course, waiting to see what are the development. But as you can hear, I guess, from my comments, we have limited concern on that matter.\nVivien Azer: Certainly. And my follow-up question is on IQOS in the U.S. If we can just revisit the timing of reintroducing that product into the marketplace, please? Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes. We expect to be in a position to introduce IQOS in H1 of 2023. I cannot be more precise at this stage. We continue to work on the plan to be able to do that. And of course, we'll keep you posted when we have more clarity and more precise reintroduction date.\nOperator: And we will take our last question from Gaurav Jain with Barclays. Your line is open.\nGaurav Jain: So a couple of questions from me. One is on Russia. So, the way you're now guiding, you are including Russia for the full year and earlier, you had included Russia just for Q1. So can you still export devices into Russia, IQOS devices because you still have IQOS shipments there? And also, can you take cash out of Russia to pay the dividends, which you are paying in USD?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Gaurav. So yes, I confirm that we can still export our device, not covered by sanction. And therefore, you have many parts of the business that are disrupted on the supply chain, but that one for the time being because, of course, you never know how this can evolve, is not impacted. On the payment of the dividend, I'm not able to tell you because we did not try to pay a dividend. So I'm not able to answer. What I can tell you is that for the time being, we've been making the usual payment between our subsidiary and in terms of procurement in terms of any kind of royalties or intercompany normally. So that's what I can tell you at that stage.\nGaurav Jain: Okay. And my second question is on the Canadian market. So clearly, you do not consolidate Canada, but you give the volume numbers. So the market is down 16% in 1H '22 and 19% in Q2. And the retail pricing, I think, is 6% to 7%, which is not out of ordinary. And then you have mentioned in the e-cigarette cannibalization and you have launched Viva, the disposable device in Canada. So what's exactly happening in Canada? Is it that e-cigarettes are now growing very fast and cannibalizing the market? Could you just help us understand that?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes. I think that is a market where you may have some basis of comparison and some one-off element, but the trend is clearly don't take the minus 60% as a reference for the market. But clearly, the trend is for combustible business to go down and for smoke-free product, including vaping, but our ambition is also to grow fast heat-not-burn to develop nicely as a substitute to combustible. That's a market on which things are moving rapidly.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the program back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Well, thank you very much for participating to this call today. We were delighted to share the very good progress that we are making on IQOS and on becoming a smoke-free company despite of fact, of course, the challenges that you all know. And we look forward to talk to you soon. Thank you very much.\nJames Bushnell: That concludes our call today. Thank you again for joining us. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations team. Thank you again, and have a nice day.\nOperator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Emmanuel Babeau",
            "content": "Thank you, James. Welcome to you in your new role, and welcome, everyone. Before I begin, I want to reiterate our focus on supporting our employees and their families affected by the war in Ukraine and above all on the safety of our people. We continue to deploy pledge humanitarian support and additional benefits for our Ukraine employees. As previously announced, we intend to exit the Russian market in an orderly manner, as the complexities of continuing to operate in Russia increase such as supply chain challenges and financial and banking sector restriction. We continue to actively work on options for doing so in the context of an increasingly complex and rapidly changing regulatory and operating environment, including the requirement to obtain certain governmental approval for any transaction. Turning to our business. We demonstrated strong underlying momentum in the second quarter of 2022 with another quarter of positive volume supporting better-than-expected top and bottom line growth. Most impressive was the continued excellent IQOS performance and strong Q2 pro forma user growth of more than 1.1 million, demonstrating further sequential acceleration compared to Q1 as device limitation and COVID restrictions continue to ease. This reflects strong momentum in the EU region, Japan and developing market. Q2 RP pro forma net revenues grew by plus 11% despite the adverse shipment timing impact due to supply chain constraints highlighted last quarter, while HTU IMS volumes grew by plus 20%. IQOS ILUMA delivered further impressive results in its first three markets of Japan, Switzerland and Spain. The acceleration in category growth in these diverse geographies highlight the exciting future growth opportunity across the world, including in the latest launch market of Greece. In combustible, robust Q2 pro forma volume growth of plus 2.4% and organic net revenue growth of plus 4.2% were driven by Marlboro share gains stronger pricing and the continued recovery of the market. Maintaining leadership of the cigarette category allows us to maximize the switching of adult smokers to smoke-free alternatives and accelerate our transformation into a predominantly smoke-free business by 2025. We expect the strong underlying momentum of our business in H1 to continue, and we are from an organic growth outlook for the year. We are now well on track to deliver two consecutive years of volume growth, confirming our status as a growth company in terms of volumes, organic net revenues and margins. Despite a substantial currency headwind in 2022, we expect to deliver full year adjusted diluted EPS of around $6, including Russia and Ukraine. The proposed addition of Swedish Match would further boost our future financial profile. This is a value-creating offer for both set of shareholders with a compelling strategic and cultural fit, providing an additional opportunity to accelerate our smoke-free future. Turning to the headline numbers. Our Q2 volumes grew by plus 3% on a pro forma basis and by plus 1.1% in total, including Russia and Ukraine. Pro forma net revenues grew organically by plus 6.2% and by plus 5.3% for total PMI, reflecting both the continued strong growth of IQOS and the ongoing recovery of the combustible business in many markets against a pandemic affected comparison. As we anticipated and indicated previously, less unfavorable timing of cigarette shipment also played a role, notably due to replenishment of duty-free inventories. Our total organic net revenue per unit grew by plus 3% on a pro forma basis and by plus 4.1% in total despite the expected delay of HTU shipments to Japan as we manage through global supply chain disruption. This incorporates combustible pricing of plus 3.5% on a pro forma basis or almost plus 5% excluding Indonesia. Our Q2 adjusted operating income margin declined organically by 190 basis points on a pro forma basis and by 150 basis points in total. As expected and communicated in our Q1 quarterly results, this reflects four main factors: first, investment to further expand and match the speed of growth in our smoke-free portfolio. This includes the initial higher cost of ILUMA devices and HTUs and the transitory dilutive margin impact of higher device sales as we roll out ILUMA and replenish distribution channel as device constraint ease to support reaccelerating IQOS user growth. Second, the impact of supply chain disruption, notably due to the war in Ukraine, including around $80 million in additional air freight expenses. Third, inflation of around 4% in our cost of goods driven by the global pandemic recovery and exacerbated by the war, notably for certain direct materials, wages, energy and transportation costs. And last, a challenging prior year margin comparison, which included substantial cost of goods sold productivity savings. Despite these typical margin challenges, our robust top line growth and ongoing cost efficiency enable us to deliver plus 5.6% growth in pro forma currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS ahead of expectation to $1.32 and plus 3.8% growth for total PMI to $1.48, including Russia and Ukraine. Looking at the first half of the year now, our volumes grew by plus 4% on a pro forma basis and by plus 2.2% for total PMI. Pro forma revenues grew by plus 8.1% and by plus 7.1% in total, also driven by strong IQOS performance and the recovery of the cigarette category. We delivered organic net revenue per unit growth of plus 4% on a pro forma basis and plus 4.7% in total, again, reflecting the positive impact of growing HT volumes and pricing. Our H1 adjusted operating income margin contracted organically by 110 basis points on a pro forma basis and 90 basis points in total, driven by the factors mentioned previously. We expect better margin performance in H2, a topic I will review it shortly. Currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS grew by plus 10.4% to $2.79 on a pro forma basis and plus 9.2% in total to $3.06, an excellent performance given the circumstances. Reflecting this strong momentum, we are raising our guidance for 2022. With strong IQOS growth and robust trends in combustible, we foresee an acceleration in our currency-neutral growth expectation relative to our previous forecast. First, we now expect to grow our total pro forma shipment volume by plus 1.5% to plus 2.5% for 2022, achieving another year of volume growth. For pro forma net revenue, we expect to deliver between plus 6% and plus 8% organic growth as compared to the plus 4.5% to plus 6.5% announced previously, despite a greater-than-anticipated drag from hyperinflationary accounting in Turkey. With a strong recovery in device volume, the increasing contribution of ILUMA with initially higher unit cost and ongoing global inflation, we are narrowing our forecast for pro forma adjusted organic OI margin expansion to between zero and plus 50 basis points. We are also raising our growth outlook for pro forma currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS to between plus 10% and plus 12%. This reflects a range of $5.23 to $5.34, including an estimated unfavorable currency impact of $0.80 at prevailing rates notably due to the euro and Japanese yen. We'll include a slide in the appendix with further detail on this estimated impact. For total PMI, which assumes a full year contribution from Russia and Ukraine, we expect adjusted diluted EPS of $5.90 to $6.05, reflecting similar dynamic to the pro forma basis and including an estimated $0.69 unfavorable currency impact. Please note our 2022 forecast assumes no contribution from the proposed combination with Swedish Match, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, subject to Swedish Match shareholder acceptance and the necessary regulatory approvals. The outlook for IQOS growth is excellent, and we now expect to deliver full year pro forma HTU shipment volume of 90 billion to 92 billion units, representing the upper half of our previous forecast range. With growth momentum very strong, the main constraint for not further raising our HTU volume target is our production capacity, notably for ILUMA HTUs due to their outstanding initial success and the cancellation of production in Russia as we convert existing production line for induction consumable. We continue to expect excellent HTU growth in the coming quarters with a progressive improvement in ILUMA HTU capacity through the first half of 2023. We are prioritizing ILUMA launch market accordingly with further launches plan in Q4 as communicated previously. A notable further update to our outlook is an increase in our operating cash flow forecast to around $10.5 billion as compared to around $10 billion previously despite notable currency headwinds. This includes our accelerated pro forma earnings growth forecast and an assumed full year contribution from Russia and Ukraine. We delivered robust operating cash flow growth in H1 of plus 14%. And as shown through the challenges of recent years, the cash generation capacity of our business remains exceptional. While flatted somewhat in 2021 by favorable timing and one-off impact, our revised full year forecast demonstrates underlying growth against this exceptional year after also accounting for higher inflation driven working capital requirements and currency. This underlines our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet, pay down debt and invest in the growth of our business. Our net debt of $23 billion at June 30, 2022, decreased compared to both June and December 2021, despite H1 capital expenditure of $0.5 billion and ongoing dividend payment. Our commitment to our progressive dividend policy is unwavering and we look forward to the additional cash flow, the proposed combination with Swedish Match would bring. We also continue to expect around $1 billion in full year capital expenditure. Moving now to the pro forma outlook for the second half. We expect to deliver strong top line growth, organic adjusted OI margin expansion and further acceleration in bottom line growth. For Q3, we expect mid-single-digit organic top line growth driven by IQOS with around $22 billion in pro forma HTU shipment volumes. While there is a tougher comparison for cigarette and a modest negative impact expected from shipment timing, we expect combustible volume trends to remain resilient by historical standards. Net revenue growth will also continue to be impacted in both Q3 and Q4 by the shift to hyperinflationary accounting in Turkey. While the temporary cost headwinds in Q2 are expected to ease somewhat in the third quarter, we expect this to be broadly offset by a step-up in smoke-free commercial and R&D investment as compared to a device constraint in Q3 2021. This results in an expected Q3 pro forma adjusted diluted EPS range of $1.23 to $1.28, including an estimated adverse currency impact of $0.24 at prevailing rates. We expect a strong Q4 with a rebound in HTU shipment volume due to phasing to the most pronounced as HT capacity constraint improve. The H2 recovery in our pro forma adjusted OI margin is also expected to be Q4 weighted. Turning back to our results. Pro forma HTU in-market sales volume grew strongly by plus 20% for both the second quarter and the first half, notably driven by strong performance in the EU region. As expected, Q2 IMS pro forma growth was significantly ahead of shipment volume growth reflecting the later timing of shipments I mentioned earlier. Our total pro forma shipment volume increased by plus 3% for Q2 and plus 4% for H1. As I touched on earlier, this put us well on track to deliver total volume growth for the second consecutive year on both a pro forma and total PMI basis. With the impressive performance of IQOS, heated tobacco units comprised 12.6% of our pro forma shipment volume in H1 or 14% in total despite the anticipated HTU shipment timing impact in Q2. Our sales mix is also changing rapidly as we aim to become a majority smoke-free company by 2025. Smoke-free net revenues made up almost 30% of our pro forma total and exceeded 30% for total PMI in the first half of the year. IQOS devices accounted for approximately 5% of the $4.2 billion of pro forma H1 RRP net revenues. This reflects higher device volume at a lower average price than last year as we expand our device portfolio with VEEV and ILUMA and price ladder, our blade device portfolio in preparation for the launch of premium position in ILUMA. The positive momentum of IQOS continues and is further accelerating in many geographies, providing a powerful driver of revenue and margin growth. We delivered organic growth of plus 8.1% in H1 pro forma net revenues and shipment on growth of plus 4%. This reflects the twin engines driving our top line in addition to volume. The first is pricing led by combustible. The second is the increasing mix of RRPs in our business at higher net revenue per unit, which continued to deliver substantial growth. This is an increasingly powerful driver as our transformation accelerate. Let's now turn to the drivers of our H1 pro forma adjusted OI margin which contracted organically by 110 basis points. Pro forma gross margin decreased by 280 basis points organically, reflecting the factors I mentioned previously, as we invest in our smoke-free business and manage temporary supply chain disruption and cost inflation. This margin headwind was partially offset by better pro forma adjusted marketing administration and reserve costs, which improved by 160 basis points organically. This was driven by the positive operating leverage of RRP growth and successful cost efficiency program where we generated around $420 million in gross cost savings, of which approximately $170 million came from COGS productivity and over $250 million from SG&A. With more than $1.2 billion of savings realized by this halfway point, we are well on track to deliver cost savings of $2 billion for 2021, 2023. This allows us to reinvest in top line growth and mitigate inflationary pressures while continuing to deliver margin expansion. We continue to accelerate investment in our commercial programs digital engine and R&D for long-term growth as well as a number of growth opportunities across categories and geographies. As reflected in our full year outlook, we expect our operating margin trajectory to improve in the second half of the year as temporary headwind and tough comparison in. Focusing now on combustible, our portfolio again delivered growth in pro forma volume and organic net revenue in Q2. Our pro forma shipment volume grew by plus 2.4% against a pandemic affected comparison notably driven by Indonesia, Poland and Turkey. In addition, we saw a continued recovery in international duty-free outside Asia as passenger traffic increases. Pro forma combustible pricing of plus 3.5% was slightly ahead of our expectations. And while we remain cautious on the economic outlook, the pricing environment has been gradually improving. We expect to deliver a similar level of pricing for the full year. Our leadership in combustibles helps to maximize switching to smoke-free product and both the positive Q2 and H1 segment share demonstrates the strength of our portfolio. We continue to target a stable category share over time despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization. This year marks the 50th anniversary of Marlboro becoming the world's leading cigarette brand. With the return of social consumption occasion, Marlboro volumes grew plus 7% year-over-year in H1, with category share again surpassing 10% on a pro forma 12-month rolling basis. Of course, our long-standing success in building Marlboro's brand equity is the strength we are now -- smoke-free product as we make excellent progress with IQOS as the undisputed global smoke-free leader. The positive combination of a stable share in combustible and the continued growth of IQOS position us to deliver total market share growth over time. We capture plus 40 basis points of pro forma share gain in Q2 including gains in duty-free, Italy, Japan and Turkey. Moreover, PMI HTU strengthened their position as the second largest nicotine brand in markets where IQOS is present with a 7.5% share, excluding Russia and Ukraine. Moving now to IQOS performance. We estimate there were approximately 19 million IQOS users as of June 30 on a pro forma basis. This reflects very strong growth of over plus 1.1 million users in Q2 and plus 2.2 million in H1, a record first half high on this basis. The acceleration of IQOS user growth compared to both Q1 and last year was driven by the reactivation of acquisition and retention program in many markets as device supply constraint receded as well as the impressive start of IQOS ILUMA. While device supply constrained has eased in recent quarter, this is largely due to the success of our own proactive effort. The global supply of semiconductors remain tight, and we continue to closely monitor and manage the situation. In the EU region, we are now approaching the milestone of 9 million IQOS users, reflecting stepped-up commercial activities to drive acquisition and retention, along with the launch of ILUMA in Switzerland and Spain. Our second quarter HTU share increased by plus 1.6 points to 7.1% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume. As noted in prior years, sequential share compared to Q1 was affected by the usual seasonality of the combustible market with the additional element of a strong year-over-year combustible recovery this quarter. Most importantly, IMS volume continued to exhibit robust sequential growth, and we expect this to continue in the second half. The strong performance includes excellent user and volume growth across the region with notable contribution from Italy and Poland. Now to give some further color on our progress in the region. This slide shows a selection of the latest key city of Texas in Q2. Despite the denominator effect of the combustible category I just mentioned, share results remain very strong. Most impressive is Venus, the first city in the world to surpass 40% share while Athens, Budapest and Rome are in the mid- to high 20s. Elsewhere, we are especially pleased by the results in London, Vienna and Zurich. In Japan, IQOS ILUMA is driving -- and our share of market continues to increase in key cities such as Tokyo. Most importantly, our IMS volume trends remained strong with continued sequential growth. As indicated last quarter, Q2 shipments were lower due to timing factors and should recover in the second half with a weighting towards Q4. The adjusted share for our H2 brands increased by plus 1.9 points to a record 22.9% in Q2 despite seasonality. While we are very pleased with these results, our share performance could have accelerated even further. The combustible category was notably resilient in the quarter and our rollout of mainline price entire HTUs for use with ILUMA was slightly slower than initially planned. However, early results were encouraging is designed to cater to its consumers switching to ILUMA and more price-conscious legal-age smokers. We also observed an increase in legal-age users switching from low price competitive product. We estimate users of competitive offering to have less average daily consumption due to lower full conversion, which we believe ILUMA should improve over time. The heat-not-burn category now represents around 1/3 of total tobacco in Japan with IQOS increasingly driving this year's growth. In addition to strong progress in developed countries, we continue to see very promising IQOS growth in low and medium income market. The pro forma share of our HTU brands in the 28 such markets launched by December 31, 2021, continued to grow and reach 2.9% in Q2, reflecting sustained growth in IMS volume. Given the large size of this market, the premium positioning of the existing IQOS portfolio and the relatively early stage of commercialization, this represents outstanding progress. A prime example of this are Lebanon where Q2 of take share in Beirut increased by plus 8.1 points to 17.4%, and Egypt where off-take share in Cairo reached around 5% after launching less than one year ago. Other notable successes include the recently launched market of Morocco and Tunisia, as well as Georgia, Jordan, North Macedonia and the Philippine despite pandemic restriction in Manila. Moving now to IQOS ILUMA, which continued to drive increased conversion and retention rate across initial launch market. In Japan, ILUMA continued to exhibit strong growth with premium priced TEREA HTUs growing rapidly to become the second largest tobacco brand, reaching an off-take share of 14.6% within nine months of national launch. Encouragingly, SENTIA off-take share has already surpassed the level of prefectures covering around 45% of industry volume. The expansion of our device portfolio with ILUMA 1 in Q1 has also seen robust traction with legal smokers. We exited Q2 with a record high of tech share and continue to see a long runway of growth in Japan for ILUMA over the coming quarters. ILUMA and TEREA HTUs also continue their super start in Spain and Switzerland. We launched ILUMA in Spain in March 2022 with very positive initial results, notably in key cities such as Barcelona and Madrid. Sequential IMS volumes grew by 27% in Q2. TEREA exited the quarter, making up over 50% of HTU sales only four months after commercialization and our national HTU share has grown to plus 1.7%. This is especially encouraging as Spain has been a market where regulatory restriction had limited the speed of IQOS growth. In Switzerland, the demand for ILUMA remains very strong. IMA's volume continued to grow sequentially, increasing plus 13% in the second quarter. A significant proportion of existing users have upgraded to ILUMA and the off-take exit volume of TEREA now exceeds 70% of our HTU sales. We continue to expand our global smoke-fee portfolio through our rich pipeline of innovation. We launched ILUMA in Greece in late June with further market launches planned for Q4. With regard to our new heat-not-burn device tailored to low and middle income market, we continue to plan pilot launches in the fourth quarter, further expanding our portfolio to serve different consumer needs and segment the market. In e-vapor, IQOS VEEV continued to deliver encouraging results, and for example, is now the established number two closed-pod brand in Italy with off-take share growing sequentially to around 20%. This is a premium proposition with an average price premium to competitive devices of 20% to 30% as we pursue differentiated and profitable category leadership position over time. In Q2, we expanded into three additional geographies, including France, and are now present in 10 markets. The latest addition to our e-vapor portfolio is the VEEBA disposable device. Responsibly marketed disposable e-vapor product can play an important role as a convenient hassle-free entry into the smoke-free category for legal-age smokers. VEEBA was recently launched in Canada with nine varieties. Our geographic expansion of smoke-free products also continued in Q2 with the launch of IQOS in Bahrain. Of course, the biggest potential near-term addition to our smoke-free portfolio is the proposed combination with Swedish Match. This would deliver a major acceleration in our transformation to becoming a smoke-free company. The visions of our two companies are aligned in working towards a smoke-free future without cigarette and would create a global smoke-free champion. If completed, we would have a comprehensive global smoke-free portfolio with leadership position in heat-not-burn and the fastest growing category of oral nicotine with potential for accelerated international expansion. Another competing rationale for this deal is a large, attractive and growing U.S. smoke-free market. Swedish Match as the leading nicotine pouch franchise, with ZYN, and a substantial U.S. operational platform, which would help us unlock the significant opportunity across other more categories over the coming years. This would be a strong strategic and cultural fit, offering significant shareholder value creation over the medium and long term. As stated in the offer document published on June 28, the waiting period for the transaction under the U.S. antitrust process has expired, meaning that we have satisfied our requirement in the U.S. to proceed with the transaction. We expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter of this year, subject to Swedish Match shareholders acceptance and the necessary regulatory approvals. Moving to sustainability, I want to first draw your attention to our 2021 integrated report published in May, which outlines our new sustainability strategy and ESG performance in detail as we continue to transform for good. Included in the report is our new sustainability index comprised of 19 KPIs across our most material sustainability issues. The index is weighted towards product transformation and now represents 30% of our long-term performance-based equity executive compensation. The definitions, methodology and scope of each of these KPIs are included in our recently published ESG KPI Protocol, providing further transparency on how we define success and major ESG performance. With regard to tackling climate change, I am delighted to report that the science-based target initiative as today validated our 2040 net-zero target. The initiative also revalidated our near-term 2030 target for reducing greenhouse gas emission and our new 2025 target for 15% of our suppliers by spend to have their own Science-Based Target by 2025 a very positive development, given that Scope 3 remains the most challenging aspect of any company decarbonization strategy. To support the achievement of these targets, we are accelerating progress to decarbonize our chain, and we have made eight more factory carbon neutral this year, more than doubling from last year and placing us on track to meet our goal of all factories by 2025. Finally, product health impact remains one of our most critical ESG priorities. There is a growing body of scientific and real-world evidence of the substantial risk reduction potential of smoke-free product compared to smoking. We continue to support policy and fiscal framework that recognize a positive impact tobacco harm reduction policy can have on public health. Recent examples include a further multiyear tax plan with differentiated treatment for smoke-free products in Romania and statement from the Belgian Superior Health Council on the whole e-vapor product can play in switching adult smokers away from cigarettes. To conclude today's presentation, we have delivered a strong first half despite some challenging headwinds, placing us well on track to deliver robust volume growth and an accelerated currency-neutral pro forma financial performance in 2022. We remain excited by the promising results of IQOS ILUMA. Increased consumer satisfaction is driving higher retention and conversion, and we look forward to further market launches later this year. Our combustible business continues to perform well with pro forma volume and organic net revenue growth, maintaining our share of market over time despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization allows us to accelerate further switching of smokers to better alternative and to invest for long-term growth in the development of innovative wellness and health care product will seek to deliver a net positive impact on society. We continue to enrich our pipeline of smoke-free innovation, such as ILUMA and VEEBA to expand and grow across new and existing category and geography. We are raising our pro forma growth guidance for the full year and expect to deliver around $6 in total adjusted in total adjusted diluted EPS, including Russia and Ukraine despite currency headwinds. Importantly, with an excellent 2021 performance and our strong 2022 outlook, we now expect to comfortably exceed our 2021-2023 minimum CAGR target on a pro forma basis of more than plus 5% in organic net revenue growth and more than plus 5% in currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth. Our ambition to become a majority smoke-free business by net revenue in 2025 also remains fully intact. We are confident in the rapid pace of our transformation. Finally, we continue to be steadfastly committed to returning cash to shareholders. Our top priority for capital allocation remain reinvestment in the business and our progressive dividend policy, underpinned by strong cash flow generation. Thank you and we are now more than happy to answer your questions. Thanks, Pamela. So we are obviously -- and I said it very pleased with the performance of IQOS, and that is certainly being reflected in the very strong user growth of more than 1.1 million in the second quarter. We said that for H1, it's a record growth. The good news is that we are really growing across geographies. So of course, we have a number of countries such as Italy, Poland, Japan, because their size, of course, they contribute more in the quarter. But the reality is that we see very good trends across geographies. And I could mention countries such as Romania, Portugal, Hungary, I mean, these are all countries of smaller size but where the growth is really impressive. So I think it's a tribute to the fact that IQOS is making some clear customer expectation, the fact that people realize all the benefits they can get by switching from combustible cigarettes to the IQOS product. There is certainly ILUMA contributing. But as you know, we are unfortunately today, limited in the number of geographies where we propose ILUMA. It's Japan Switzerland and Spain. We've been launching Greece. So that is certainly in this country, helping the performance. But to be very clear, the performance is across the board, as I said, and including country where we haven't launched yet ILUMA. So certainly, we are improving the way we deliver a great customer experience, including digital customer, how we contact smokers, how we get in touch with them, how we start the dialogue, how we explain the benefit of IQOS and how we are leading them in the journey from moving away from combustible products to IQOS. So no doubt, we continue to improve our commercial engine, and that is helping. There is probably the impact of awareness, visibility that is growing. There are markets where when you start to reach a certain market share, IQOS become visible, more visible, you go in bars, you go in events, you go in social gathering, you see more and more people, and that triggers what we call organic growth, people who wants to discover by themselves about IQOS. They want to learn, friends explaining how it works and why they really enjoy IQOS. We are also accelerating innovation. We have been proposing new devices. We are proposing new type of references. So, we are enlarging the choice and that make probably IQOS even more desirable and attractive. So that's really, I think, all the powerful driver behind the success of IQOS. Now if I focus on ILUMA and what is the potential with more ILUMA capacity, we see it in the three markets where we have been launching. ILUMA is resolving the remaining pain point that was -- that are existing on the previous version of IQOS. It's certainly coming with a great customer experience. It is increasing the conversion, the loyalty. We expect it to increase the average daily consumption as well and to significantly reduce our [indiscernible]. We see the customer Net Promoter Score improving in the countries. So that is obviously bringing more momentum in the country where we are launching ILUMA. And I think we should see it as a kind of second stage of the rocket that we are going to launch in the various countries to sell IQOS even higher, and that we expect in the various countries where we're going to launch in the coming quarters. Today, we are focusing on Swedish Match. The time line is the one we were expecting at the beginning. We continue to expect the closing of the transaction in Q4, of course, subject to Swedish Match shareholder acceptance. Nothing has changed. We are focusing on that. Am I closing the door in the future on other things that would further accelerate our journey to become a leading and successful smoke-free company? No. But clearly, the priority and the focus today is on Swedish Match. Yes. Thanks, Bonnie for the question. So I mean, that's true that in H1, we've seen a number of headwinds on the margin. Needless to say that inflation, of course, is one. And we said that we are seeing around 4% inflation on our input cost. So I guess it's probably lower than inflation that we see in many countries, but that's significant. Obviously, we have costs that are coming from the disruption in the supply chain, notably coming from the war in Ukraine. We have a dramatic acceleration of air freight that is, of course, temporary. We're not going to keep air shipping on the long term. But during a period of time, we need to do that, and it's very costly at the time where the cost of freight is globally, not only for air but globally going up. So we are obviously being impacted. So that is having an impact here. And then there is a launch of ILUMA at the beginning, notably in Japan, where we had a very, very strong investment, which was really important to make on the device. And we have two devices now offering -- three device, actually, three models in Japan, and the strong volume in device has an impact on the margin level. On top of that, we said it since the beginning, we don't start the launch of ILUMA with optimized cost and weight on TEREA and on SENTIA. And that is coming at the beginning with a negative impact on margin which something that is temporary as well. So we expect in the course of 2023 seems to gradually improve. So inflation is not temporary. I think for the rest, a lot of the headwinds that we are seeing in H1 are temporary, and there will be a recovery in the future. I'm not able at that stage and we do that, of course, as we are gaining visibility to phase it in the coming quarter, but that's certainly what we that's what we are expecting. And then clearly, for H2, we are expecting an improvement on the margin. Certainly, that would be skewed to a large extent to Q4, but already the deterioration in Q3 on the gross margin would be lower, but there will be more investment as we know we are just following the growth, and we are putting the right level of investment to cope with the growth. Q4, we'll be clearly seeing a better improvement with the better mix. Remember, we've been impacted also on the margin by the fact that the volume that we should have been shipping and it should have been the P&L to Japan, and that are having a very nice margin are not in the P&L. And so of course, it's another one-off that was impacting H1, but we will have the compensation in H2. So, yes, difficult beginning of the year, it doesn't mean that everything will be back to normal in H2. That will be still with some headwind. But clearly, most of what we are facing is temporary, and they will be over time, a recovery on the margin. Thank you, Bonnie. What I can tell you on Swedish Match is, first of all, to repeat that we have cleared the U.S. requisite in terms of regulatory approval. So that is behind us. For the rest, the processes are still ongoing in several jurisdictions according to plan. And we are confirming the fact that we expect what we said in beginning closing in Q4, of course, subject to Swedish Match shareholder acceptance. And here, I would like to reiterate the fact that we believe that this is a very compelling offer for Swedish Match shareholder. Can I remind everybody that we offered a 40% for the premium at the time of the announcement in May, since then, the markets have been quite volatile, most of them going down, and that this offer has been approved by the Board of Swedish Match, which was confirming the fact that they thought it was compelling for their shareholders. So that's what I have to say on Swedish Match. And I have no other comment to make. Yes, Chris, if I can try to help you, what we expect in Q3 is shipment to be much more in line with the underlying growth that we have seen on the IMS in H1, which was around 20%. So that's what we expect in shipment, but we don't expect the recovery of the shipments that have been missing in H1. We expect this recovery in Q4, where we continue to expect very strong dynamism of IQOS consumables. But then the shipment will be in Q4 above IMS to broadly align for the year, shipment and IMS. So that is the phasing that we expect for the year. I think you have two elements, Chris, here. The first one, remember, we had some constraint on device availability that started in Q2, some impact in Q3 and last year. So of course, there is an increase in the device level this year based on low comps. So that's the first element. And I think it's really important to realize how important it is to make sure that smokers can have access to IQOS device to get converted. So I think it's important that we make commercial effort here. And I think we're doing that well. And we see that our device versus maybe some device from the competition is clearly getting a better conversion. On top of it and then the second element, it is clear that with ILUMA, there is a wave of replacement. So, we see in the markets where we launched ILUMA, a rapid replacement of existing IQOS blade device by IQOS ILUMA. And that -- this wave of replacement is creating a very strong one-off acceleration in the level of device. When people will be equipped when the core consumer will be equipped that will be behind us, but we have to go through that. And that is having, again, on a temporary basis, a negative impact on the margin. Look, I'm not sure we disclosed the component of menthol. Of course, that's a minority of our business. What I can say about that is that we have to understand that this is a move in application from the TPD in Europe. So it's not a decision. It's an application based on the TPD of 2014, which in certain circumstances was planning for a kind of automatic ban to be implemented. Now this still needs to be approved by the parliament and by the European Council that will be in front of these two bodies later on in 2022, and we'll see what is the final decision. To be very clear, it already has happened on a combustible business with almost no impact or very limited impact. So, the consumer reorganize their taste and they switch to other products, but very limited impact. And therefore, it isn't clear that this will have a meaningful impact if it happens on our heat-not-burn business. In addition to that, we believe that we have superiority in our tobacco taste versus competition, and that's the superiority of our technology with IQOS versus the technology of the competition. So that will mean if we are left with tobacco taste that our product will look great versus competition for people who may decide to go for new product, if they have to abandon on flavor. So we are, of course, waiting to see what are the development. But as you can hear, I guess, from my comments, we have limited concern on that matter. Yes. We expect to be in a position to introduce IQOS in H1 of 2023. I cannot be more precise at this stage. We continue to work on the plan to be able to do that. And of course, we'll keep you posted when we have more clarity and more precise reintroduction date. Thank you, Gaurav. So yes, I confirm that we can still export our device, not covered by sanction. And therefore, you have many parts of the business that are disrupted on the supply chain, but that one for the time being because, of course, you never know how this can evolve, is not impacted. On the payment of the dividend, I'm not able to tell you because we did not try to pay a dividend. So I'm not able to answer. What I can tell you is that for the time being, we've been making the usual payment between our subsidiary and in terms of procurement in terms of any kind of royalties or intercompany normally. So that's what I can tell you at that stage. Yes. I think that is a market where you may have some basis of comparison and some one-off element, but the trend is clearly don't take the minus 60% as a reference for the market. But clearly, the trend is for combustible business to go down and for smoke-free product, including vaping, but our ambition is also to grow fast heat-not-burn to develop nicely as a substitute to combustible. That's a market on which things are moving rapidly. Well, thank you very much for participating to this call today. We were delighted to share the very good progress that we are making on IQOS and on becoming a smoke-free company despite of fact, of course, the challenges that you all know. And we look forward to talk to you soon. Thank you very much."

A glossary of terms, including the definition for reduced-risk products, or RRPs, as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures and additional heated tobacco unit market data are at the end of today\u2019s webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Unless otherwise stated, all references to IQOS are to our IQOS heat-not-burn products, and all references to smoke-free products are to our RRPs. Growth rates presented on an organic basis reflect currency-neutral adjusted results excluding acquisitions. Figures and comparisons presented on a pro forma basis entirely exclude PMI\u2019s operations in Russia and Ukraine. In the third quarter of 2021, we acquired Fertin Pharma, Vectura Group and OtiTopic. On March 31, 2022, we launched a new Wellness and Healthcare business, Vectura Fertin Pharma, which consolidates these entities. The operating results of this new business are reported in the Other category. Business operations of our Wellness and Healthcare business are managed and evaluated separately from the geographical segments. Today\u2019s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements disclosure in today\u2019s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It\u2019s now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, Chief Executive Officer, and Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer. Over to you, Jacek. 1\nJacek Olczak: Thank you, Nick, and welcome everyone. I hope you are all safe and well. Recent months have been extremely challenging for many of us given the tragic events related to the war in Ukraine. I would like to express our sadness and solidarity for the people of Ukraine. Our primary concern is for our employees and their families and we have been doing everything we can to support them, with three priorities. First, evacuating our colleagues, we have evacuated over 1,000 colleagues and family members from the country and supported more than 2,700 others to move from conflict zones to locations away from the heaviest fighting. Second, we are delivering critical aid to people that cannot leave or who decided to remain in Ukraine. And third, we are providing accommodation, immediate assistance and a path forward to those who left the country. In addition, we have already contributed around $10 million in funds and donated essential items across the country, directly to humanitarian organizations and through our own employee-led initiative, Projects With a Heart. This includes providing medicine, food, clothes, and a variety of other items to our colleagues and to the broader population, the purchase of 25 ambulances and the set-up of a mobile hospital. Based on our current visibility, we estimate an additional cost of around $25 million for additional support to employees this year. Our colleagues in neighboring countries continue to provide vital support to all people arriving from Ukraine to seek refuge. Our heartfelt gratitude goes to everyone involved in these generous efforts to help at such a difficult time. In terms of the impact on our business operations, production at our Ukraine manufacturing facility in Kharkiv remains suspended. While business activities in Eastern Ukraine have been mostly heavily impacted, we have seen some resumption in areas where conditions allow as we seek to maximize product availability and service to consumers, using existing inventories on hand. We are also now planning to import products from other manufacturing locations, although this may involve higher costs. We continue to pay salaries to all our Ukrainian employees and to provide substantial in-kind support to them and their families. As communicated in our March 24 press release, PMI\u2019s board of directors and senior executive team are working on options to exit the Russian market in an orderly manner in the context of a complex and rapidly changing regulatory and operating environment. This is no easy task in view of recently introduced complex legislation, but we are committed to seeking a viable path to exit the market while supporting our employees in Russia throughout this period. It is also clear that we cannot continue business as usual in light of regulatory and supply chain disruption, which has already impacted the Russian business in Q1. We have taken concrete steps to scale back our operations, such as the cancellation of all new investments and product launches, including IQOS ILUMA and IQOS VEEV. We are delisting 25% of our cigarette products, including Marlboro and Parliament SKUs. We have also canceled the $150 million investment in capacity to ultimately manufacture more than 20 billion TEREA sticks for IQOS ILUMA in our Russian factory. Clearly, the impact of the conflict has also created disruption in global supply chains and exacerbated inflationary pressures in certain materials and services. However, the Q1 performance and outlook for our business excluding Russia and Ukraine remains strong. On a reported basis our outlook conservatively assumes no further contribution from Russia or Ukraine from April 1. To provide a consistent view, given the uncertainty and volatility of these two markets, we will now also provide adjusted results and guidance on a pro forma basis excluding Russia and Ukraine from both the prior and full current year. I will now hand over to Emmanuel to cover this in more detail.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Jacek. We delivered a very strong performance in Q1, with double-digit organic net revenue and currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth on a pro forma basis, excluding Russia and Ukraine from both the current and prior year quarter. Overall currency-neutral results were also ahead of our expectations. Our IQOS business delivered an excellent quarter, continuing the reacceleration seen last quarter as device supply constraints continue to ease. Our IQOS user base grew by more than 1 million excluding Russia and Ukraine, marking a very strong performance. RRP pro forma net revenues grew by 23%, with pro forma smoke-free net revenues over 30% of the total company. Importantly, pro forma HTU shipment volumes grew plus 18% compared to the prior year quarter. This reflects excellent progress in the EU Region, continued growth in Japan as well as over 50% growth in low and middle income markets. PMI HTUs are now the second largest nicotine brand in markets where IQOS is present as our efforts on innovation, portfolio and geographic expansion drive consumer trial and adoption. The impressive start for IQOS ILUMA continues in Japan and Switzerland, with very encouraging initial take-up in our latest launch market of Spain. The initial success in these three very different markets reaffirms our confidence in ILUMA as an exciting future growth driver for our company. Meanwhile, our combustible business performed robustly, exceeding our objective of stable category share and delivering positive volume and organic net revenue growth. In addition to supporting strong financial performance, this also enhances our ability to maximize the switching of adult smokers to smoke-free alternatives. Overall, our business is off to a strong start and while currency is unfavorable in 2022, we expect to deliver another year of robust organic top and bottom line growth. Turning to the headline numbers, our Q1 net revenues grew organically by plus 9% in total and plus 10% on a pro forma basis. This reflects total volume growth driven by the underlying strength of IQOS, the ongoing recovery of the combustible business in many markets against a pandemic-affected comparison and some positive timing impacts, including inventory movements. Our total organic net revenue per unit grew 5.3% and by plus 4.9% on a pro forma basis, driven by the increasing proportion of IQOS HTUs in our sales mix, higher device volumes, and pricing. Combustible pricing was above expectations at plus 2.9% pro forma or around plus 6% also excluding Indonesia. Our total Q1 adjusted operating income margin declined organically by 30 basis points and by 40 basis points excluding Russia and Ukraine. This reflects a lower gross margin compared to a tough prior year comparison where productivity was higher mostly due to timing factors. As flagged in our full year earnings, Q1 margins were impacted by higher device sales for increasing IQOS user acquisition, channel replenishment and IQOS ILUMA. As mentioned previously, the unit cost and weight of ILUMA consumables and device cost is initially higher as we ramp up production, with improvement expected from next year. Inflation in certain elements of our supply chain, including energy, wages and direct materials and an increase in the use of air freight, was also exacerbated by the impact of the war in Ukraine. Despite these temporary margin challenges, we saw positive effects of the increasing size of IQOS, pricing, and cost efficiencies combined with our strong net revenue growth. This enabled us to deliver adjusted diluted EPS of $1.56, including unfavorable currency of $0.23, representing plus 14% currency-neutral growth. This was comfortably ahead of our currency-neutral expectations, even accounting for timing benefits of around $0.06. Excluding Russia and Ukraine, our pro forma adjusted diluted EPS of $1.46 grew by plus 16%. Turning now to our 2022 outlook. As Jacek mentioned, given the lack of visibility on Russia and Ukraine, we are now providing an adjusted outlook on a pro forma basis excluding these two markets for the entire year. With our underlying business reaccelerating, our growth fundamentals remain strong. Importantly, we expect to deliver organic net revenue growth of plus 4.5% to plus 6.5% compared to 2021 pro forma adjusted net revenues of $29.2 billion. This is above our previous forecast trajectory for total PMI, despite an approximate half-point drag from the shift to hyperinflationary accounting in Turkey. This range incorporates the risk of supply chain disruption for certain materials, a somewhat slower TEREA production capacity build-up due to the production cancellation in Russia, part of which was designated for export, the remaining uncertainty on full device availability, and the pace of the ongoing pandemic recovery. We expect our pro forma adjusted operating income margin to be organically zero to plus 100 basis points higher for the full year. As mentioned at full year results, we expect a lower gross margin as we invest in new innovations and incur temporarily higher unit and transportation costs for the fast growth of ILUMA. Since then, we have observed increased inflation in raw material and energy prices, and additional supply chain costs due to war-related disruptions including a temporary increase in air freight for both HTUs and select cigarette products. Higher expected device sales from the tremendous uptake of IQOS ILUMA, and easing of device supply constraints also have an initial dilutive margin impact. Despite these added headwinds, and a further expected COGS increase of around $300 million compared to our initial expectations we remain confident that we will achieve organic pro forma margin expansion as our strong revenue growth, favorable product mix and cost savings initiatives deliver sustainable accretion. We forecast pro forma currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 9% to plus 11%, also above our prior total PMI full year guidance. This translates into a pro forma adjusted diluted EPS range of $5.35 to $5.46, including an estimated unfavorable currency impact of around $0.63 at prevailing rates. This compared to our previous 2022 adjusted diluted EPS guidance of $6.12 to $6.30 provided in February, with the difference primarily reflecting the exclusion of Russia and Ukraine and an incremental unfavorable currency impact. The underlying IQOS growth outlook remains excellent. On a pro forma basis, we expect to deliver between 88 billion and 92 billion HTU shipment volumes, representing plus 20% to plus 25% growth over the pro forma prior year of 73.5 billion units. This excludes the nearly 5 billion units shipped in Russia and Ukraine in Q1, and while we conservatively assume no further such contribution from April 1, this implies a total outlook of 93 billion to 97 billion units for the year. We continue to expect pro forma HTU shipments to be modestly ahead of IMS for the year, after lagging behind in the second quarter as I\u2019ll explain later. As outlined in today\u2019s release, there are a number of other assumptions underpinning our outlook. We expect the total industry volume of cigarettes and HTUs, excluding Russia, Ukraine, U.S. and China, to decline by up to minus 1%. Given our leadership in smoke-free products, the structural growth of the category and its growing proportion in our business, as well as stabilizing share in combustibles, we expect to gain share. We therefore target positive total PMI pro forma shipment volumes, within a range of flat to plus 1%. We assume full year combustible pro forma pricing of around plus 3%, now including the adverse impact from hyperinflationary accounting in Turkey. The pricing environment is improving, including in Indonesia, although challenges remain due to ongoing pandemic-related impacts and disposable income pressures. Our other assumptions include around $10 billion in operating cash flow and a effective tax rate of 21% to 22%. We continue to expect full-year capital expenditures of around $1 billion. Despite the impact of the war in Ukraine, our balance sheet remains strong and we remain steadfastly committed to returning cash to shareholders through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. With regard to the phasing of pro forma performance this year, we expect a robust H1 overall, with margin expansion and adjusted diluted EPS growth weighted to the second half. In large part, this reflects the reacceleration of IQOS as device supply constraints ease, with a sharp recovery in device volumes as we replenish channel inventories for user acquisition and we supply the accelerated ILUMA replacement cycle in Japan. In addition, our average device price is lower than the prior year, reflecting stepped-up commercial activities to drive acquisition, including the broadening of our device portfolio with LIL and ILUMA ONE. While our devices continue to be priced at a meaningful premium to heavily discounted competitive offerings, we have already seen encouraging signs in stabilizing our high category share. Moreover, as we adjust our supply chain flows to prevailing global disruptions in various materials and logistic services, combined with the effects of the war in Ukraine, there may be a risk of short out-of-stock situations on certain cigarette SKUs in select markets, and we are making adjustments to some products to reflect the availability of specific materials. The reorganization of supply chain flows will contribute to the later timing of shipments to certain markets. We notably expect Q2 to be impacted by a number of temporary or specific factors, including the reversal of certain Q1 timing benefits. Organic pro forma net revenue growth is expected to be low single-digit, with other notable factors including the delayed timing of HTU and cigarette shipments to Japan with an approximate 2 point drag on growth, and a further impact from the shift to hyperinflationary accounting in Turkey, where the Q2 exchange rate comparison is accentuated. We expect total PMI pro forma HTU shipments of around 20 billion in Q2, partly reflecting around 3 billion less HTU shipments to Japan than originally planned. This compares to 18.7 billion pro forma in Q2, 2021. We expect these 3 billion units to move to H2, generating a further growth acceleration in the third and fourth quarters. For Q2 pro forma operating margins, the disproportionate impact of the catchup in device shipments will be accompanied by a corresponding step-up in commercial investments as we support the reacceleration of IQOS user acquisition over the coming quarters. In tandem with the negative mix impact of lower shipments to Japan, the highest expected quarterly increase in air freight costs of over $80 million, and other supply chain adjustment costs, we expect margins to contract further, before a significant recovery in the second half. These dynamics are reflected in our expectation of H1 pro forma adjusted diluted EPS of $2.65 to $2.70, including an unfavorable currency impact of $0.36 at prevailing rates. This represents currency-neutral growth of 5% to 7% compared to $2.86 in the prior year. In combination with our strong first quarter, H1 pro forma top line performance is expected to deliver organic growth of 5% to 7% overall. In H2, the powerful drivers of pricing, scale and efficiencies, and the receding of temporary cost headwinds, should outweigh inflationary pressures to deliver strong top line growth, organic margin expansion and an acceleration in bottom-line growth. Our strong 2022 outlook places us firmly on track to deliver our 2021, 2023 CAGR targets on a pro forma basis of more than 5% in organic net revenue growth, and more than 9% in currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth. We remain on track to deliver around $2 billion in gross cost savings by 2023, which is especially important given global inflationary pressures. Importantly, our ambition to become a majority smoke-free business by net revenues in 2025 remains intact. We remain confident in the rapid pace of our transformation. Turning back to our Q1 results, total shipment volumes increased by 3.5% on a total PMI basis and by 4.9% pro forma. This reflects continued strong broad based pro forma growth of plus 18.4% as user acquisition reaccelerates from the Q3 2021 supply-driven slowdown; and an increase of plus 3.2% in pro forma cigarette volumes reflecting the continued recovery of the total industry and of our category share. The transformation of our business towards smoke-free products continues at a rapid pace. Heated tobacco units comprised almost 13% of our total pro forma shipment volumes in the first quarter, as compared to 11.6% in full year 2021. Our sales mix is also evolving rapidly, as we become majority smoke free company. Smoke-free net revenues made up over 30% of our pro forma total in Q1, compared to 27.9% for full year 2021. IQOS devices accounted for approximately 6% of the $2.1 billion of Q1 RRP pro forma net revenues, reflecting higher year-over-year device volumes as supply constraints ease and ILUMA performs strongly. We delivered organic growth of plus 10% in Q1 pro forma net revenues on shipment volume growth of plus 4.9%. This growth reflects the twin engines driving our top line. The first is pricing, led by combustibles. The second is the increasing mix of regulatory projects in our business at higher net revenue per unit, which continues to deliver substantial growth; an increasingly powerful driver as our transformation accelerates. Let\u2019s now turn to the driver of our Q1 pro forma OI margin, which declined by 40 basis points. Our pro forma gross margin decreased organically by 250 basis points reflecting the factors I mentioned earlier. Conversely, our pro forma adjusted marketing, administration and research costs were 210 basis points better organically, due to the positive operating leverage of IQOS growth and successful cost efficiency programs. We generated around $180 million in gross cost savings in the first quarter, with around $80 million in COGS productivities and $100 million from SG&A. This makes over $1 billion since the start of 2021, already over halfway towards our target of around $2 billion for 2021, 2023. This allows us to reinvest in top line growth, and mitigate inflationary pressures while continuing to deliver solid margin progression. We continue to accelerate investment in our commercial programs, digital engine and R&D, as well as a number of growth opportunities across categories and geographies. As reflected in our full year guidance, we expect our operating margin progression to improve over the course of the year as temporary headwinds and tough comparisons ease. Our combustible portfolio performed well in Q1, with robust pro forma growth in volumes and organic net revenues. This notably reflects a further recovery in Indonesia and the Philippines, supporting an expectation of organic net revenue growth and broadly stable volumes in our South and Southeast Asia region this year. Increased travel also supported volume growth in Spain and Duty Free. Our share of the combustible category continued to recover with a plus 0.4 point pro forma gain in Q1 on a year-over-year basis. This includes gains in Japan, Turkey and Duty Free as our portfolio initiatives bear fruit and social consumption resumes with Marlboro share plus 0.3 points higher. While the category is declining over time, our leadership in combustibles helps to maximize switching to smoke-free products, and we continue to target a stable category share over time, despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization. In terms of our overall market share now, ongoing gains for our IQOS portfolio create continued positive momentum. We delivered pro forma share growth in Q1 as expected, including gains in Italy, Duty Free, Egypt, Germany and Poland. PMI HTUs are now the second largest nicotine brand in the markets where they are present with a 7.5% share excluding Russia and Ukraine. This includes the number one position in six markets. Moving now to the IQOS performance, we estimate there were approximately 17.9 million IQOS users as of March 31, excluding Russia and Ukraine, which had an estimated 4.8 million users at December 31, 2021. This reflects pro forma growth of more than 1 million users, a phenomenal performance by historic standards. This was driven by the resumption of consumer programs in many markets as device supply constraints receded, capitalizing on the strong underlying demand for the brand, as also evident in the very impressive start of IQOS ILUMA. We estimate that 71% of total IQOS users outside Russia and Ukraine or 12.7 million adult smokers have switched to IQOS and stopped smoking, with the balance in various stages of conversion. We were also very encouraged by the FDA\u2019s recent MRTP order for IQOS 3, with the full range of authorized IQOS products now classified as modified risk tobacco products. In the EU Region, first quarter HTU share reached 7.6% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume, representing a first quarter share gain of 2 points, including a small benefit from the timing of inventory movements. Adjusted IMS volumes also continue to exhibit robust sequential growth, and we expect this to continue in the second quarter, noting that the usual seasonality of the combustible market combined with the reversal of Q1 inventory movements is expected to result in a lower sequential share in Q2. This very good performance includes strong user and volume growth across the region, with especially notable contributions from Italy and Poland. I also want to again highlight Hungary and Lithuania where our Q1 national HTU share exceeded 25%. To give some further color on our progress in the EU Region, this slide shows a selection of the latest key city offtake shares. While Vilnius continues to lead the way, approaching 40% share; Budapest, Rome and Athens are also well into the mid-to-high 20s. Elsewhere, we are especially pleased by Vienna more than doubling to 5%, the strong traction in London at over 6% share, and a further acceleration in Zurich with the introduction of ILUMA. In Japan, the adjusted share for our HTU brands increased by plus 1.9 points to a record 22.7% in Q1. This performance reflects the strength of our portfolio and the launch of IQOS ILUMA, which is also driving notable gains in Tokyo and other key cities. We expect strong offtake trends to continue in Q2, reaching around 24% market share, despite seasonality effects. Conversely, as I touched on earlier, supply chain constraints will likely result in Q2 HTU shipments below the prior year. With HTU inventories consequently reduced in the second quarter, we expect the replenishment in H2 to deliver a substantial recovery. Notwithstanding such quarterly volatility, with substantial commercial activities planned and excellent underlying momentum, we expect strong double-digit HTU shipment volume growth in Japan this year. In addition to strong progress in developed countries, we see very promising IQOS growth in low and middle income markets. The share of our HTU brands in the 28 such markets launched by December 31, 2021, excluding Russia and Ukraine, grew by plus 0.8 points compared to the prior year to reach 2.7%. Given the large size of these markets, the premium positioning of the existing IQOS portfolio and the relatively early stage of commercialization, this represents excellent progress. As mentioned last quarter we also intend to bring a new complementary range of heat-not-burn devices and HTUs tailored to emerging markets towards the end of this year. A prime example of this is Egypt, where offtake exit share in Cairo is approaching 5% within 8 months of launch, as compared to total Q1 share of 4.3%. Other notable successes including the recently launched market of Morocco as well as Lebanon, Jordan, the Dominican Republic and the Philippines, despite pandemic restrictions in Manila. Moving now to IQOS ILUMA, we are delighted to report the further outstanding success since its launch, with sales performance and consumer reactions still exceeding our expectations. In Japan, the uptake of ILUMA devices and consumables among both existing IQOS users and legal-age smokers has been rapid, with more than 30% of the large user base up-trading since the August 2021 launch, and over 20% of sales remain to legal-age smokers new to IQOS. Moreover, the enhanced and consistently high quality user experience, better reliability and no need for cleaning has led to significant observed increases in conversion rates, retention rates and Net Promoter Score. This bodes well for volumes, with premium-priced TEREA consumables the fastest growing launch in the smoke-free category, reaching an offtake share of 12% within six months of national launch; overtaking Marlboro Heatsticks and HEETS combined to become the number one smoke-free brand. We now have all three IQOS ILUMA devices in the market following the launch of ILUMA ONE, which provides multiple consecutive use at a more affordable price points. We are also introducing a new HTU brand called SENTIA for use with ILUMA, in select prefectures at a mainline price point comparable to HEETS. Results in Switzerland have again been even more remarkable, with significant sales to new users, and TEREA making up almost two-thirds of HTU sales after only five months of commercialization. Our HTU share growth has accelerated from less than 6% in Q3 to 9% this quarter, with notable success in the German-speaking majority of the country. Our newest ILUMA launch was in Spain last month. While very early days the signs are also very positive with device sales to new users increasing 50% compared to the prior run rate, 10% of existing users upgraded within the first month, and TEREA exiting March at over one quarter of total HTU offtake. These results across three markets with differing consumer characteristics and level of RRP maturity are clearly very encouraging for the wider roll-out of ILUMA around the world. While device supply constraints are easing, the timing of HTU availability for new ILUMA markets has been somewhat delayed given the rapid uptake in the initial markets, and the resulting need for greater supply for each new market than was originally anticipated. In addition, the cancellation of our investment in the production of TEREA HTUs in our Russian facility has a short-term impact. As a result, further market launches are now mostly expected towards the end of H2. With ILUMA, IQOS 3 DUO and LIL, we now have three heat-not-burn technologies under the IQOS umbrella to serve different consumer needs and segment the market. We have an exciting pipeline of innovation on devices and consumables at different price tiers. In e-vapor, IQOS VEEV\u2019s promising results in the first group of markets continue. VEEV is a premium proposition, with an average price premium to competitive devices of 20% to 30%, making these results especially encouraging as we pursue a differentiated and profitable category leadership position over time. We see further success in Italy reaching almost 20% offtake share of closed system pods, with rapid progress also visible in Croatia within eight months of launch. In the Czech Republic, after some temporary supply disruption at the start of the quarter which affected Q1 share, rapid growth has resumed. VEEV was present in seven markets at March 31, and we plan to add more this year, with timing subject to device availability. Separately, our re-launched commercialization of nicotine pouches under the Shiro brand in the Nordics is progressing well, with positive consumer feedback. Moving to sustainability and our ESG priorities, I\u2019m happy to share two important developments published in our 2022 proxy statement. Firstly, our Board of Directors updated our company\u2019s statement of purpose, expanding it beyond smoke-free, to better reflect the role of wellness and healthcare in our corporate strategy and transformation. Second, the introduction of a bespoke Sustainability Index explicitly links our ESG performance to 30% of long-term compensation. Further details will be shared in our Integrated Report on May 17, and further dedicated disclosures. Product health impact remains one of our most critical ESG priorities, and the growing penetration of smoke-free products around the world is accelerating the end of cigarettes, as legal-age smokers switch to better alternatives. There is a growing body of scientific and real-world evidence of the substantial risk reduction potential of smoke-free products compared with smoking. While challenges in some markets are to be expected, we continue to support regulatory and fiscal frameworks that recognize the positive impact tobacco harm reduction policies can have on public health. A recent example of this is Italy, which has established distinct excise tax categories for heatnot-burn, e-vapor and nicotine pouches. Thank you. And I\u2019ll now turn it back to Jacek.\nJacek Olczak: Thank you Emmanuel. Despite the challenges in Russia and Ukraine, we have delivered an excellent start to the year with a strong recovery in IQOS user growth, and exceptional initial results from the groundbreaking innovation of IQOS ILUMA. As we covered recently at CAGNY, we have a rich pipeline of further smoke-free innovations to expand and grow across new and existing categories and geographies. Our combustible business is now stabilizing category share, despite the impact of IQOS cannabilization, which allows us to accelerate further switching of smokers to better alternatives. We also continue to invest for long-term growth through the development of innovative wellness and healthcare products, which seek to deliver a net positive impact on society. Our 2022 fundamentals are strong, with a pro forma expectation of 4.5% to 6.5% organic net revenue growth and 9% to 11% currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth. Despite the significant inflationary pressures and disruption in global supply chains affecting first half and the full year, we also expect our organic operating income margin to expand to up by 100 basis points. In addition, we have taken the conservative assumption in our reported guidance of no further contribution from Russia or Ukraine from April 1. Overall, we are very confident in the near and mid-term growth outlook and remain committed to sustainably rewarding shareholders over time as we continue our transformation. Thank you. And we are now happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nChris Growe: Hi, good morning.\nJacek Olczak: Good morning.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Hi, Chris.\nChris Growe: Hi. I just wanted to ask if I could, first, as I think about your IQOS guidance for the year and obviously reducing that for Russia and Ukraine, I just wanted to be sure, as you think about \u2013 the new guidance incorporates your expectations excluding Russia and Ukraine, is that the only adjustment that you\u2019ve made for volume and that estimate the new 88 billion to 92 billion sticks, is that just taking out your expectation for Russia and Ukraine for this year?\nJacek Olczak: That\u2019s correct. We\u2019re just talking for the entire year the volumes from Russia and Ukraine. But then, obviously, for the Q1 we recognize what have been sold in both geographies, which is 5 billion. Therefore, on a pro forma for the full year excluding Russia and Ukraine looking into 88 billion to 92 billion. But if you add back the 5 billion, which we already sold during the first period, the first quarter, that directly translates to 93 billion-97 billion, which would assume or is assuming that there is no further sales of IQOS as of April 1 in neither Russia nor Ukraine.\nChris Growe: Got it. Thank you. And then I just wanted to understand a little bit about the second quarter, you\u2019ve talked about higher device shipments in the quarter. I think that\u2019ll be a stronger driver of revenue growth at the same time you have some timing differences, it sounds like at least in Japan where that will weigh on revenue overall. I think you\u2019re expecting more like a low single-digit increase in revenue. So I just want to understand I guess to the degree you can help in terms of the magnitude of those two factors. It sounds like the Japan timing maybe a larger factor on 2Q revenue. And then just to understand also the availability of devices. Is it the second-half when that\u2019s back to like a, I\u2019ll call it full availability of devices? And is that a function of not having devices committed to Russia and Ukraine is providing more availability for the rest of the world, help that clear? Thanks.\nJacek Olczak: Yes. Okay. So the first quarter shipments of the devices on the one hand, yes, you\u2019re absolutely right, it contributes to the better help to the global revenue, but remember that the devices are putting a pressure on the margins, right. So that\u2019s started between the devices and the impact on the one hand on the revenue and the margins. The big impact which we expect to have in Q2 is on the supply of the shipments of the consumables. So the heat sticks and TEREA. And as a result, among other constraints on the supply chain of stopping the investment in Russia, we need to resource that missing capacity to our locations and it will take us a while. And therefore, we expect that we will go lower with the inventories in Japan, mainly Japan in order to ensure that on the manufacturing side, the proper resourcing we will have when we expect quite a robust growth on IMS, and the market share. And I think, Emmanuel, on the slide have indicated that we should think we\u2019re aiming at 24% \u2013 around 24% market share for the quarter in Japan. So it\u2019s nothing on the consumer level on the offtake level, but we need to do this operations through the inventories in order to resume to the normal course of shipments in the Q3 and Q4. And hence, this will drive the better performance and stronger performance in the second half than the first half, which will be what we estimate to be impacted by the Q2 difference in the shipments. Now with regards to the devices, I mean, there is this continuous sale of the devices in the excluded geographies, right. So it\u2019s not that we stopped selling, we stopped recognizing this whole thing due to the visibility and the other factors, what is happening in Russia and Ukraine. But in reality, we need to keep at least the replacement devices, right. So it\u2019s not that you can take the volume out of Russia and Ukraine and to redirect them to other locations. We do have actually getting better and better, but not perfect visibility with regards to the device supplies. And remember, we\u2019ve been very cautious about second half of last year. And the moment when we had the better order fulfillment and also better visibility with regards to the future orders for this year, we feel more confident about how we can realize the \u2013 fully realize the opportunity of IQOS. So that looks okay it\u2019s not perfect, but I don\u2019t want to misled anybody it\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s better than say at the beginning of the year. And you saw it at the moment that we have regained some, have almost full-fledged availability of devices how IQOS could accelerate its growth for the user acquisition and the market share progression in Q1. So we know that we have it, but everything hinges on a continually and undisturbed uninterrupted supplies of the both devices and heat sticks.\nEmmanuel Babeau: And Chris maybe just to complement, I think it\u2019s really important that everybody understand the evolution of the gross margin in Q1, Q2 and H1 versus H2. I\u2019m sure you remember that last year, the gross margin in H1 was extremely high, we were at 70%. The gross margin was lower and probably more normative in H2. So what we have seen in Q1 was first of all facing very high comps. I think we\u2019ve been describing in the presentation, the various driver for the 250 basis point reduction in the gross margin. What you can expect for Q2 is this element to continue knowing that the gross margin reference is 70% as well last year in Q2. And on top of it, we will have more device sales even than in Q1, which I think is good news because it shows the success of IQOS. We have increased air freight cost for the reason that we mentioned and the tension on the supply chain and that\u2019s going to have an impact on the margin. And last element, you have this mix, which is a temporary element of course like air freight, by the way on the fact that the volume will be lower for Japan in Q2 with the recovery and the compensation in H2. And with that, you have the reason for increased pressure, gross margin pressure in Q2, but with the compensation that will come in H2.\nChris Growe: That was great color. Thanks so much.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nPamela Kaufman: Hi, good morning.\nJacek Olczak: Good morning.\nPamela Kaufman: I have a question on the 2023 outlook and how you\u2019re thinking about your targets for next year, particularly on the HTU side, should we assume a similar reduction to your heated tobacco target as the guidance reduction for this year of about 20%? And given Russia\u2019s significant contribution to the overall IQOS business, how are you adjusting your strategy for achieving your target for 50% of revenue coming from smoke free products by 2025? Thank you.\nJacek Olczak: Well \u2013 thank you. We continue with the geographical and portfolio expansion of IQOS in the existing and the new geographies and obviously this we confronted with all the supply chain constraints and availability of devices et cetera. So I mean, we all know this. The good way or one of the way maybe to look at that 2023 target, so I believe you\u2019re referring to the absolute volume target for IQOS is that, okay, let\u2019s assume that we don\u2019t have and the lowest assumptions you can make is that we will not realize any further sales as of April 1 in Russia and Ukraine and that\u2019s essentially the floor on that thing. Where do we land? I think everyone will appreciate we need a little bit of a time to really have the full visibility what\u2019s happening or what we will do with our business and our intentions about exiting Russia and also what\u2019s the \u2013 whatever might be the longer term outlook for our Ukrainian et cetera. There will be a band in absolute numbers. It\u2019s no questions about it. The way I look into this whole thing, we may be in a situation that we\u2019ll deliver this target, but with about a 12 months delay. I mean, I am not in a position \u2013 my thinking is not changed the target just recognized that you maybe need a little bit of additional time to deliver on this target. All other parameters, the relative growth targets being the top-line, bottom-line and the relative growth of the \u2013 or relative contribution, which is very important target for us of the non-combustible to combustible business they remain as we have said before. And on that one I\u2019m confident we should be in a position to deliver this. But in absolute volume, yes, I mean, we might have a miss. But the way again, sorry for repetition, I look at this, maybe I need a 12 months more to deliver the same target for other geographies and organic growth in existing geographies.\nEmmanuel Babeau: And Pamela, on your question on how do we get to more than 50% in 2025. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen that in Q1, on a pro forma basis excluding Russia and Ukraine we are a bit below the full perimeter of the Group, but not that much below. So we are at 30% versus around 31%. So, yes, there is a bit more ground to cover to get to 50%. But given the dynamism that we see in our IQOS business and the opportunity we\u2019ve been clearly showing in low-and middle-income country, we think we can catch up and deliver this more than 50%.\nPamela Kaufman: Thanks. And then a question on new IQOS user acquisition, you saw a good recovery this quarter, despite taking out the impact from Russia to 1 million user \u2013 over 1 million users. Do you expect to see a similar piece of new user acquisition over the course of the year? And how much of a role did ILUMA play in that, would there be any impact from the supply disruption on the TEREA consumables? Did you hear my question?\nJacek Olczak: Yes, I think your question was, sorry, because we all cut half the sentence. Your question was can we expect the same dynamics of the user acquisition right going forward?\nPamela Kaufman: Yes.\nJacek Olczak: Okay. So look, I mean, above 1 million acquisition this quarter, which show the growth sequentially above close to 1 million acquisition, the Q4. I mean that directly correlated to our availability of devices and a full portfolio of devices. As you know, we also play now the different price segments game, we have more expensive devices, mid-price devices, lower-price devices. So as long as we have availability of devices, I actually think that number, we should repeat the same sort of the rate, if not actually higher, because you could see from the conversion perspective and the consumer liking measured by NPS and other parameters what we\u2019re offering today that is meeting the consumer expectations. So there\u2019s also bridging somehow to the before questions that once we see the visibility on the devices, right, in the next quarter or so and all the dynamics, which we can achieve outside the Russia and Ukraine then we would be in a positions to revise what actually we will deliver in a year from now in terms of the total IQOS volume.\nPamela Kaufman: Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Vivien Azer with Cowen. Your line is open.\nVivien Azer: Hi, good morning.\nJacek Olczak: Hi, good morning, Vivien.\nVivien Azer: So I wanted to follow up on Japan, I\u2019m just having a hard time reconciling two comments that you guys made. Number one that there was negative device mix in the quarter, but that you had device growth from ILUMA, because last quarter, I thought the launch of ILUMA was mix accretive in Japan, so am I misunderstanding something or did something change? Thanks.\nJacek Olczak: I think that the device mix we\u2019re talking that we\u2019re selling three \u2013 as of now, three versions of IQOS ILUMA, you have a premium, mid and the lower price, lower price was just introduced now to the market to the consumers. So obviously in the shipments, we already had them in the Q1, because this is all recognized on the shipment. And second is that this device, I mean, the ILUMA ONE, which is the lowest price device goes at attractive price in the market, higher than the competitions, but attractive and lower than the price that we used to have on the one version of IQOS 3 before. So maybe here to Vivien we need to look into.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yeah, Vivien if I may, Emmanuel speaking. It\u2019s a positive in the mix within the device, because it come at a higher price. But any growth in device is negative to the mix in term of gross margin, because it\u2019s coming with of course a much reduced gross margin versus the consumables. So the more device we sell, you have some impact on the revenue, which is positive, but it has a dilutive impact on the gross margin rate to be very clear.\nVivien Azer: Understood. I think we had sales graph was the pricing tier. So thank you both for that. For my second question, I was hoping to get some incremental color on Germany, you had meaningful share growth, both on a year-over-year and a sequential basis. Is there anything to call out there from an activation standpoint, because the results were very strong?\nJacek Olczak: No, this again comes so we had post price increase, post price change environment in Germany, the one thing. And second is, again, I mean the Germany start benefiting from not the restricted access to the devices. So this again follows the same story that we have a continuous broad range availability of the devices. We can go into the portfolio again and hence the performance. And this is one additional comment I would make here Vivien is that Germany is still running on the IQOS free one version, which is a blade version and the reasons why we went for example to Switzerland with IQOS ILUMA before opening the larger market, which obviously will take a lot of volume of the device is how IQOS ILUMA would to performing in the similar sort of a geography. So I am very pleased with the success so far of IQOS ILUMA in Switzerland, especially the German speaking part, because I used this as a \u2013 we could use this as the proxy for German on acceleration of the \u2013 further acceleration of the growth in Germany. Now, nothing is certain in life. But I think this is as far as we can read through the consumer reactions in Switzerland.\nVivien Azer: Understood. Thank you very much.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nBonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you. Hi, everyone. I had a few questions on Russia, I guess, I was hoping you could share, maybe just a few more details on your exit from the country and really what the mechanics of that are? I guess, could you help us understand what\u2019s being manufactured in the market currently? And then what about the volume your manufacturing facility in St. Petersburg exports? Can you share with us roughly what percentage of the volume is exported? And then where you plan to maybe shift that volume to and when? And I guess, I\u2019m just trying to think about all this in terms of any costs associated with that? And then is that being reflected in your guidance?\nJacek Olczak: Bonnie, Jacek here. Judging just by the number of details, you mentioned in that question you will appreciate how complex the situation is in Russia. So one by one. Russia in terms of the so far production and export allocation was not really that significant. We had a much more significant plans of expanding Russia is that one of the key suppliers of new IQOS ILUMA and hence our decision to immediately stop that investment as a result of that we created a temporary halt for the rest of the market. Partially for Russia launch of ILUMA, which we also canceled, but also that Russia was supposed to contribute to the supply of the ILUMA consumables that are HeatSticks into other markets, including in Japan. So our first priority is how we can resource that capacity there. Obviously, that capacity means that we have an equipment installed in Russia. And we can\u2019t \u2013 so we don\u2019t use this equipment today. What will happen to that equipment going forward? We are also working on a certain plans, but I would stop here, I will not go into more details. Now to exit Russia in the orderly manner for us that we need to reconcile the interest first of all of our shareholders, the employees in Russia. And you know that the ever-evolving legislation in Russia puts the significant risk or constraints of our ability to adhere. And this is only in the context of the very evolving regulatory environment, both on the international, it\u2019s obviously the sanctions, but also the legislations or legislation in Russia. So if we want to, we have a significant presence in Russia, as we all know it. We\u2019re in the market, organically built the business over the last 30 years. This is 100% business of PMI International. We don\u2019t have any partners contributing to the core business. We obviously are connected with the local supply chains and wholesale and distribution components. But PM Izhora and Philip Morris sales and distribution is 100% Philip Morris business. We have some shareholding in addition to this, we have a key distributor in the market together along with our major tobacco company. And to unwind in orderly manner all the strengths, which we have in Russia is a complex endeavor, but we are committed to do so. Hence, in our guidance and the decisions to look at the PMI as the rest of the business, which is doing absolutely great despite all of the headwinds, which we have and so on rather than have polluted with something which we have limited visibility and ability to act accordingly. So I know that my answer have not gave you more clarity, but that is the best which we can say at this moment. I mean, we\u2019re working on exit, but presumably, one of the most complicated transactions in the terms of the history of the group, which we\u2019re drawing from the board.\nBonnie Herzog: Yes, I can only imagine. I appreciate the color. And just to be clear, just in terms of the exit. Do you have a target date, the full exit of the market that you can share?\nJacek Olczak: Well, we rather not delay beyond what is necessary as long as we satisfy all the teams or the groups if you like. And again I repeat it, I mean our \u2013 we have a responsibility to shareholders. But we also have responsibility to employees in Russia. And overall, broad group of stakeholders with the various expectations and try to resolve that equation to the satisfaction of everyone that\u2019s becoming complex exercise. But we are working relentlessly of how to move forward. I mean I would appreciate that if this was any other size of the business and presence in the market things could have looked differently. But this was a very big business for us.\nBonnie Herzog: And honestly, that kind of brings me to my second question, as I think about your new pro forma HTU volume guidance of 88 billion to 92 billion units for this year, which is assuming 22% growth at the midpoint. I guess, I\u2019d like to understand the key drivers of that since the growth outlook is now I guess, above your previous guidance, but Russia really I thought was such an important driver of that and for your future. So I just kind of want to understand what gives you the confidence, especially also on top of the uncertainty related to the semiconductor chip shortage situation? Thanks.\nJacek Olczak: Yes. Thank you. So obviously we need to make some or making some assumptions on the supply chain, as I said earlier. We don\u2019t live today in a perfect visibility for all the remaining quarters of this year. But I think we have enough of the confidence to come up with this pro forma estimate or this pro forma guidance. Now, look, you see that continuous trajectory of IQOS growth in essentially in all geographies, including the geographies that historically were a bit tougher for us, where yet we had the progress, but they were not really growing at the group level of the growth and now we see that Japan, with that ILUMA and a few other locations with ILUMA already having a massive acceleration of the growth. We know what we have in our plans for this thereafter with ILUMA. We also know that IQOS [indiscernible] which is the currently the mostly sold device also continues to be very attractive. And this is continuously despite the fact that we offering our portfolio both of the devices and the consummables at a significant premium to any other market propositions. I think we\u2019re getting this confidence that IQOS continue to grow and we\u2019re looking forward also to the moment when it will accelerate its growth. Will IQOS in a near term excluding Russia and Ukraine, sorry, the rest of the geographies compensate the lack of Russia and Ukraine? I think over a longer period of time, we once notice, but in shorter period of time it might a bit challenging, okay. We\u2019re not making any promises at this stage.\nBonnie Herzog: Okay. Thank you.\nJacek Olczak: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Gaurav Jain with Barclays. Your line is open.\nGaurav Jain: [Technical Difficulty]\nNick Rolli: Gaurav, we can\u2019t hear you. Could you repeat the question please?\nGaurav Jain: Sure. Is this better?\nNick Rolli: Yes, it\u2019s better. Yes, thank you.\nGaurav Jain: Sorry about that. So my first question is your guidance on industry volume and your own volume ex-Russia and Ukraine. So it seems to have become better. And if I look, especially at your European volumes, they are quite strong. So we have this sort of the macro pressure on consumers and inflationary pressure and Europe might be in recession, not in recession oil price impact. So my question is that why are you seeing stronger volumes? And is it that when cigarette prices historically used to be up 4 in Europe and wage growth was 1, so cigarettes are becoming less affordable and right now cigarette pricing is still 4 while wage inflation is probably 4 or 5, so cigarettes are actually becoming more affordable and that\u2019s why you are seeing better volume trends?\nJacek Olczak: Well, I think we should \u2013 I mean, we have the information of Q1 that are pointing to this evolution. It is true, Gaurav, that there are no uncertainty on what\u2019s going to be the growth of the global economy in the coming quarters. I suppose there is some trend in the market that our underlying trends in term of demographics and behaviors. Let\u2019s face it there is also still the contribution of rebound after the COVID. So last year was not a normal year, we are becoming much more normal. I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re there yet. I mean, in Duty Free, we\u2019re not. But in other markets, we can hope that for the coming months to be more normal and that\u2019s going to be a positive. So I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to be the impact of a potential slowdown of the economy. By the way, we\u2019re going to have an impact on volume or more on downtrading and some countries in consumer going for cheaper offering. Today what we see and we\u2019ve been highlighting that is Marlboro recovering market share and we see Chesterfield being very successful and we see of course great success with all our IQOS brands. So that is what is driving for us this outlook for growth in volume. And of course, starting Q1 with a very nice growth, even if we flag the fact that there were some \u2013 maybe some anticipation, but I think that the Q1 numbers are there. It shows the dynamism that we are seeing in our portfolio.\nGaurav Jain: Sure. And coming to the EPS guidance and the dividend. So your dividend payout ratio will now be north of 90%. So how does that impact, how you\u2019re thinking about share repurchases? And we keep seeing the cycles with PM every three years, you have massive adverse FX and we go back 10 years, euro used to be \u20ac150, yen was JPY70, then we had one cycle in 2014 and 2017. Now we have another cycle of FX. And clearly a lot of your costs are in Swiss franc and dollar. So is there something you can do so that the cost mismatch, the transaction FX mismatch is lesser? And we again get into the situation where dividend payout ratio is becoming very tight.\nJacek Olczak: Well, Gaurav, so yes, of course on the basis of the guidance that we\u2019ve been giving, we would have a payout ratio that would significantly increase versus 2021. I think we\u2019ve shown in the past, the capacity to grow in profit over time and reduce that. Our objective to go down over time and we didn\u2019t give any kind of precise to go down to 75% is still there. I agree that given the adverse event that we are facing, it\u2019s going to take a bit more time to get there. That\u2019s the case, not so much, I mean, the currency is playing, but it\u2019s really the accumulation of currency and Russia leaving the perimeter of the group that is driving that situation. Now on the ForEx there\u2019s two elements. One is the pressure on margin and we continue to work on trying to equalize better the currency in which we\u2019re investing and the currency in which we have our cost. We do that with the supply chain. There are some limitation, because there are a number of things that you buy in dollar, of course, we do that through everything we buy. But there is one element that we kind change that we have limited invoicing in dollar. So when the dollar is going up versus most of the currency that is an impact, which is mechanical and on which there is not much we can do. So we can work and I think we continue to work on the margin dimension. We cannot work on the fact that we have limited invoicing.\nGaurav Jain: Sure. Thanks a lot.\nJacek Olczak: Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Owen Bennett with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nNick Rolli: Owen, do you have a question?\nOperator: And it appears Mr. Bennett has dropped. We will go ahead and take our next question from Jared Dinges with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJared Dinges: Hi guys. I just wanted to ask about the pricing environment given inflation in places like Europe is reaching levels not seen for a long time. Do you think there could be more of an opportunity to put through additional price increases given you are seeing cost inflation as well on a global basis, especially post Russia and Ukraine? Maybe we can see a bit more of a margin offset.\nJacek Olczak: We\u2019re taking a price increase and a price variance. So the opening of the \u2013 came in be better than we initially thought. We will see what the remaining part of the year and especially the second half will bring. When we look at the inflation, I mean, we also have to look of what is the inflation of the material. So like the cost of living and what is the inflation of the income, right? Because we haven\u2019t yet seen the inflation on the income level at the concept level. So we have to find the right spot at the right balance where do we get into this. But in most of the geographies I mean the pricing environment, I would characterize it is getting positive. I mean, Emmanuel, talk about the Indonesia. On the other hand, we have a very strong rebound in volumes in Indonesia. And hopefully also Indonesia, which used to be quite important a significant contributor to the pricing will hopefully towards the end of this year or definitely 2023 will resume this pricing contribution. We had a price increase in Germany flowing through the market, the Philippines, Turkey, okay. Now Turkey goes to the hyper-inflationary accounting. We\u2019re trying to price it widely, looking at the inflation as the pressure. But as I said, at the beginning of the year we already started with the ahead of our own expectations pricing variance. So let\u2019s see how that this will continue through the year.\nJared Dinges: Got it. And maybe just to follow up on Southeast Asia, clearly it\u2019s a very strong start to the year in terms of volumes, what are your expectations there on the volume side for the rest of the year?\nJacek Olczak: Well, there is this continuous \u2013 remember this is the part of the world, which is still not out of the woods with regards to COVID unfortunately, right? So the situation is not really didn\u2019t get back to the pre-COVID side. I believe there is some underlying growth opportunities just by the fact that if they continue to recover from the COVID situation, we should start seeing the continuously better volume. And as I said, I mean we took the price increase in, Philippines, we\u2019re taking some pricing in, we\u2019re taking the pricing a little bit accelerated in Indonesia, but on the other hand, we are still in the \u2013 as you remember, Indonesia take a couple of around steps of a price increase to pass on the beginning of the excise increase. So we still need a bit of time to go into the net margin improvement territory. But it\u2019s very much hinges essentially to keep it short on continuous recovery and no further surprises with regards of the COVID situation.\nEmmanuel Babeau: And Jared, as we said, we expect to grow nicely revenue in the region this year, which would be a very nice evolution.\nJared Dinges: That\u2019s correct. Thanks, guys.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nNick Rolli: Thank you. That was the last question, operator.\nOperator: And there are no further questions on the line. I will turn the program back over to Nick Rolli for any additional or closing remarks.\nNick Rolli: I think Jacek had some closing remarks.\nJacek Olczak: Okay, so thank you everyone for your attention and the patients and the quarter was pretty complex and complicated for us and since due to some technical problems the earnings call also can\u2019t somehow adjusted to the situations in the quarter. I have one on the comment toward everyone I hope is still on the line. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Nick Rolli, outstanding contribution to PMI and our former parent company over the past 35 years and particularly as the Vice President, Investor Relations since the 2008 Philip Morris International. As you all believe will agree with me, he has been a critical contributor through the journey of our company. And I know that you, our investors and analysts will join me in congratulating Nick and to wish him all the best for his very well deserved retirement. At the same time, I would also like to congratulate James Bushnell on his new role I have a pleasure because I personally was hiring Mr. Bushnell to PMI in his new role as the successor to Nick Rolli and I believe he would receive the same support and we welcome as Nick Rolli enjoy from you for the last 35 years. So welcome James, and thank you, Nick.\nNick Rolli: Thank you, Jacek. Thank you, Emmanuel. Congratulations, James. Thank you all on the call because I know we had some long relationships with many of you and I value that relationship and thank you very much. That concludes the call. And we apologize for the technical difficulties on my last call. But we\u2019ll will resolve everything and look forward to dealing with your follow-up questions. Thank you very much.\nJacek Olczak: See you soon, guys. Thank you.\nOperator: This does conclude today\u2019s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

            "name": "Jacek Olczak",
            "content": "Thank you, Nick, and welcome everyone. I hope you are all safe and well. Recent months have been extremely challenging for many of us given the tragic events related to the war in Ukraine. I would like to express our sadness and solidarity for the people of Ukraine. Our primary concern is for our employees and their families and we have been doing everything we can to support them, with three priorities. First, evacuating our colleagues, we have evacuated over 1,000 colleagues and family members from the country and supported more than 2,700 others to move from conflict zones to locations away from the heaviest fighting. Second, we are delivering critical aid to people that cannot leave or who decided to remain in Ukraine. And third, we are providing accommodation, immediate assistance and a path forward to those who left the country. In addition, we have already contributed around $10 million in funds and donated essential items across the country, directly to humanitarian organizations and through our own employee-led initiative, Projects With a Heart. This includes providing medicine, food, clothes, and a variety of other items to our colleagues and to the broader population, the purchase of 25 ambulances and the set-up of a mobile hospital. Based on our current visibility, we estimate an additional cost of around $25 million for additional support to employees this year. Our colleagues in neighboring countries continue to provide vital support to all people arriving from Ukraine to seek refuge. Our heartfelt gratitude goes to everyone involved in these generous efforts to help at such a difficult time. In terms of the impact on our business operations, production at our Ukraine manufacturing facility in Kharkiv remains suspended. While business activities in Eastern Ukraine have been mostly heavily impacted, we have seen some resumption in areas where conditions allow as we seek to maximize product availability and service to consumers, using existing inventories on hand. We are also now planning to import products from other manufacturing locations, although this may involve higher costs. We continue to pay salaries to all our Ukrainian employees and to provide substantial in-kind support to them and their families. As communicated in our March 24 press release, PMI's board of directors and senior executive team are working on options to exit the Russian market in an orderly manner in the context of a complex and rapidly changing regulatory and operating environment. This is no easy task in view of recently introduced complex legislation, but we are committed to seeking a viable path to exit the market while supporting our employees in Russia throughout this period. It is also clear that we cannot continue business as usual in light of regulatory and supply chain disruption, which has already impacted the Russian business in Q1. We have taken concrete steps to scale back our operations, such as the cancellation of all new investments and product launches, including IQOS ILUMA and IQOS VEEV. We are delisting 25% of our cigarette products, including Marlboro and Parliament SKUs. We have also canceled the $150 million investment in capacity to ultimately manufacture more than 20 billion TEREA sticks for IQOS ILUMA in our Russian factory. Clearly, the impact of the conflict has also created disruption in global supply chains and exacerbated inflationary pressures in certain materials and services. However, the Q1 performance and outlook for our business excluding Russia and Ukraine remains strong. On a reported basis our outlook conservatively assumes no further contribution from Russia or Ukraine from April 1. To provide a consistent view, given the uncertainty and volatility of these two markets, we will now also provide adjusted results and guidance on a pro forma basis excluding Russia and Ukraine from both the prior and full current year. I will now hand over to Emmanuel to cover this in more detail. Thank you Emmanuel. Despite the challenges in Russia and Ukraine, we have delivered an excellent start to the year with a strong recovery in IQOS user growth, and exceptional initial results from the groundbreaking innovation of IQOS ILUMA. As we covered recently at CAGNY, we have a rich pipeline of further smoke-free innovations to expand and grow across new and existing categories and geographies. Our combustible business is now stabilizing category share, despite the impact of IQOS cannabilization, which allows us to accelerate further switching of smokers to better alternatives. We also continue to invest for long-term growth through the development of innovative wellness and healthcare products, which seek to deliver a net positive impact on society. Our 2022 fundamentals are strong, with a pro forma expectation of 4.5% to 6.5% organic net revenue growth and 9% to 11% currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth. Despite the significant inflationary pressures and disruption in global supply chains affecting first half and the full year, we also expect our organic operating income margin to expand to up by 100 basis points. In addition, we have taken the conservative assumption in our reported guidance of no further contribution from Russia or Ukraine from April 1. Overall, we are very confident in the near and mid-term growth outlook and remain committed to sustainably rewarding shareholders over time as we continue our transformation. Thank you. And we are now happy to answer your questions. Good morning. That's correct. We're just talking for the entire year the volumes from Russia and Ukraine. But then, obviously, for the Q1 we recognize what have been sold in both geographies, which is 5 billion. Therefore, on a pro forma for the full year excluding Russia and Ukraine looking into 88 billion to 92 billion. But if you add back the 5 billion, which we already sold during the first period, the first quarter, that directly translates to 93 billion-97 billion, which would assume or is assuming that there is no further sales of IQOS as of April 1 in neither Russia nor Ukraine. Yes. Okay. So the first quarter shipments of the devices on the one hand, yes, you're absolutely right, it contributes to the better help to the global revenue, but remember that the devices are putting a pressure on the margins, right. So that's started between the devices and the impact on the one hand on the revenue and the margins. The big impact which we expect to have in Q2 is on the supply of the shipments of the consumables. So the heat sticks and TEREA. And as a result, among other constraints on the supply chain of stopping the investment in Russia, we need to resource that missing capacity to our locations and it will take us a while. And therefore, we expect that we will go lower with the inventories in Japan, mainly Japan in order to ensure that on the manufacturing side, the proper resourcing we will have when we expect quite a robust growth on IMS, and the market share. And I think, Emmanuel, on the slide have indicated that we should think we're aiming at 24% \u2013 around 24% market share for the quarter in Japan. So it's nothing on the consumer level on the offtake level, but we need to do this operations through the inventories in order to resume to the normal course of shipments in the Q3 and Q4. And hence, this will drive the better performance and stronger performance in the second half than the first half, which will be what we estimate to be impacted by the Q2 difference in the shipments. Now with regards to the devices, I mean, there is this continuous sale of the devices in the excluded geographies, right. So it's not that we stopped selling, we stopped recognizing this whole thing due to the visibility and the other factors, what is happening in Russia and Ukraine. But in reality, we need to keep at least the replacement devices, right. So it's not that you can take the volume out of Russia and Ukraine and to redirect them to other locations. We do have actually getting better and better, but not perfect visibility with regards to the device supplies. And remember, we've been very cautious about second half of last year. And the moment when we had the better order fulfillment and also better visibility with regards to the future orders for this year, we feel more confident about how we can realize the \u2013 fully realize the opportunity of IQOS. So that looks okay it's not perfect, but I don't want to misled anybody it's not perfect, but it's better than say at the beginning of the year. And you saw it at the moment that we have regained some, have almost full-fledged availability of devices how IQOS could accelerate its growth for the user acquisition and the market share progression in Q1. So we know that we have it, but everything hinges on a continually and undisturbed uninterrupted supplies of the both devices and heat sticks. Good morning. Well \u2013 thank you. We continue with the geographical and portfolio expansion of IQOS in the existing and the new geographies and obviously this we confronted with all the supply chain constraints and availability of devices et cetera. So I mean, we all know this. The good way or one of the way maybe to look at that 2023 target, so I believe you're referring to the absolute volume target for IQOS is that, okay, let's assume that we don't have and the lowest assumptions you can make is that we will not realize any further sales as of April 1 in Russia and Ukraine and that's essentially the floor on that thing. Where do we land? I think everyone will appreciate we need a little bit of a time to really have the full visibility what's happening or what we will do with our business and our intentions about exiting Russia and also what's the \u2013 whatever might be the longer term outlook for our Ukrainian et cetera. There will be a band in absolute numbers. It's no questions about it. The way I look into this whole thing, we may be in a situation that we'll deliver this target, but with about a 12 months delay. I mean, I am not in a position \u2013 my thinking is not changed the target just recognized that you maybe need a little bit of additional time to deliver on this target. All other parameters, the relative growth targets being the top-line, bottom-line and the relative growth of the \u2013 or relative contribution, which is very important target for us of the non-combustible to combustible business they remain as we have said before. And on that one I'm confident we should be in a position to deliver this. But in absolute volume, yes, I mean, we might have a miss. But the way again, sorry for repetition, I look at this, maybe I need a 12 months more to deliver the same target for other geographies and organic growth in existing geographies. Yes, I think your question was, sorry, because we all cut half the sentence. Your question was can we expect the same dynamics of the user acquisition right going forward? Okay. So look, I mean, above 1 million acquisition this quarter, which show the growth sequentially above close to 1 million acquisition, the Q4. I mean that directly correlated to our availability of devices and a full portfolio of devices. As you know, we also play now the different price segments game, we have more expensive devices, mid-price devices, lower-price devices. So as long as we have availability of devices, I actually think that number, we should repeat the same sort of the rate, if not actually higher, because you could see from the conversion perspective and the consumer liking measured by NPS and other parameters what we're offering today that is meeting the consumer expectations. So there's also bridging somehow to the before questions that once we see the visibility on the devices, right, in the next quarter or so and all the dynamics, which we can achieve outside the Russia and Ukraine then we would be in a positions to revise what actually we will deliver in a year from now in terms of the total IQOS volume. Hi, good morning, Vivien. I think that the device mix we're talking that we're selling three \u2013 as of now, three versions of IQOS ILUMA, you have a premium, mid and the lower price, lower price was just introduced now to the market to the consumers. So obviously in the shipments, we already had them in the Q1, because this is all recognized on the shipment. And second is that this device, I mean, the ILUMA ONE, which is the lowest price device goes at attractive price in the market, higher than the competitions, but attractive and lower than the price that we used to have on the one version of IQOS 3 before. So maybe here to Vivien we need to look into. No, this again comes so we had post price increase, post price change environment in Germany, the one thing. And second is, again, I mean the Germany start benefiting from not the restricted access to the devices. So this again follows the same story that we have a continuous broad range availability of the devices. We can go into the portfolio again and hence the performance. And this is one additional comment I would make here Vivien is that Germany is still running on the IQOS free one version, which is a blade version and the reasons why we went for example to Switzerland with IQOS ILUMA before opening the larger market, which obviously will take a lot of volume of the device is how IQOS ILUMA would to performing in the similar sort of a geography. So I am very pleased with the success so far of IQOS ILUMA in Switzerland, especially the German speaking part, because I used this as a \u2013 we could use this as the proxy for German on acceleration of the \u2013 further acceleration of the growth in Germany. Now, nothing is certain in life. But I think this is as far as we can read through the consumer reactions in Switzerland. Bonnie, Jacek here. Judging just by the number of details, you mentioned in that question you will appreciate how complex the situation is in Russia. So one by one. Russia in terms of the so far production and export allocation was not really that significant. We had a much more significant plans of expanding Russia is that one of the key suppliers of new IQOS ILUMA and hence our decision to immediately stop that investment as a result of that we created a temporary halt for the rest of the market. Partially for Russia launch of ILUMA, which we also canceled, but also that Russia was supposed to contribute to the supply of the ILUMA consumables that are HeatSticks into other markets, including in Japan. So our first priority is how we can resource that capacity there. Obviously, that capacity means that we have an equipment installed in Russia. And we can't \u2013 so we don't use this equipment today. What will happen to that equipment going forward? We are also working on a certain plans, but I would stop here, I will not go into more details. Now to exit Russia in the orderly manner for us that we need to reconcile the interest first of all of our shareholders, the employees in Russia. And you know that the ever-evolving legislation in Russia puts the significant risk or constraints of our ability to adhere. And this is only in the context of the very evolving regulatory environment, both on the international, it's obviously the sanctions, but also the legislations or legislation in Russia. So if we want to, we have a significant presence in Russia, as we all know it. We're in the market, organically built the business over the last 30 years. This is 100% business of PMI International. We don't have any partners contributing to the core business. We obviously are connected with the local supply chains and wholesale and distribution components. But PM Izhora and Philip Morris sales and distribution is 100% Philip Morris business. We have some shareholding in addition to this, we have a key distributor in the market together along with our major tobacco company. And to unwind in orderly manner all the strengths, which we have in Russia is a complex endeavor, but we are committed to do so. Hence, in our guidance and the decisions to look at the PMI as the rest of the business, which is doing absolutely great despite all of the headwinds, which we have and so on rather than have polluted with something which we have limited visibility and ability to act accordingly. So I know that my answer have not gave you more clarity, but that is the best which we can say at this moment. I mean, we're working on exit, but presumably, one of the most complicated transactions in the terms of the history of the group, which we're drawing from the board. Well, we rather not delay beyond what is necessary as long as we satisfy all the teams or the groups if you like. And again I repeat it, I mean our \u2013 we have a responsibility to shareholders. But we also have responsibility to employees in Russia. And overall, broad group of stakeholders with the various expectations and try to resolve that equation to the satisfaction of everyone that's becoming complex exercise. But we are working relentlessly of how to move forward. I mean I would appreciate that if this was any other size of the business and presence in the market things could have looked differently. But this was a very big business for us. Yes. Thank you. So obviously we need to make some or making some assumptions on the supply chain, as I said earlier. We don't live today in a perfect visibility for all the remaining quarters of this year. But I think we have enough of the confidence to come up with this pro forma estimate or this pro forma guidance. Now, look, you see that continuous trajectory of IQOS growth in essentially in all geographies, including the geographies that historically were a bit tougher for us, where yet we had the progress, but they were not really growing at the group level of the growth and now we see that Japan, with that ILUMA and a few other locations with ILUMA already having a massive acceleration of the growth. We know what we have in our plans for this thereafter with ILUMA. We also know that IQOS [indiscernible] which is the currently the mostly sold device also continues to be very attractive. And this is continuously despite the fact that we offering our portfolio both of the devices and the consummables at a significant premium to any other market propositions. I think we're getting this confidence that IQOS continue to grow and we're looking forward also to the moment when it will accelerate its growth. Will IQOS in a near term excluding Russia and Ukraine, sorry, the rest of the geographies compensate the lack of Russia and Ukraine? I think over a longer period of time, we once notice, but in shorter period of time it might a bit challenging, okay. We're not making any promises at this stage. Thank you. Well, I think we should \u2013 I mean, we have the information of Q1 that are pointing to this evolution. It is true, Gaurav, that there are no uncertainty on what's going to be the growth of the global economy in the coming quarters. I suppose there is some trend in the market that our underlying trends in term of demographics and behaviors. Let's face it there is also still the contribution of rebound after the COVID. So last year was not a normal year, we are becoming much more normal. I'm not saying we're there yet. I mean, in Duty Free, we're not. But in other markets, we can hope that for the coming months to be more normal and that's going to be a positive. So I don't know what's going to be the impact of a potential slowdown of the economy. By the way, we're going to have an impact on volume or more on downtrading and some countries in consumer going for cheaper offering. Today what we see and we've been highlighting that is Marlboro recovering market share and we see Chesterfield being very successful and we see of course great success with all our IQOS brands. So that is what is driving for us this outlook for growth in volume. And of course, starting Q1 with a very nice growth, even if we flag the fact that there were some \u2013 maybe some anticipation, but I think that the Q1 numbers are there. It shows the dynamism that we are seeing in our portfolio. Well, Gaurav, so yes, of course on the basis of the guidance that we've been giving, we would have a payout ratio that would significantly increase versus 2021. I think we've shown in the past, the capacity to grow in profit over time and reduce that. Our objective to go down over time and we didn't give any kind of precise to go down to 75% is still there. I agree that given the adverse event that we are facing, it's going to take a bit more time to get there. That's the case, not so much, I mean, the currency is playing, but it's really the accumulation of currency and Russia leaving the perimeter of the group that is driving that situation. Now on the ForEx there's two elements. One is the pressure on margin and we continue to work on trying to equalize better the currency in which we're investing and the currency in which we have our cost. We do that with the supply chain. There are some limitation, because there are a number of things that you buy in dollar, of course, we do that through everything we buy. But there is one element that we kind change that we have limited invoicing in dollar. So when the dollar is going up versus most of the currency that is an impact, which is mechanical and on which there is not much we can do. So we can work and I think we continue to work on the margin dimension. We cannot work on the fact that we have limited invoicing. Thank you. We're taking a price increase and a price variance. So the opening of the \u2013 came in be better than we initially thought. We will see what the remaining part of the year and especially the second half will bring. When we look at the inflation, I mean, we also have to look of what is the inflation of the material. So like the cost of living and what is the inflation of the income, right? Because we haven't yet seen the inflation on the income level at the concept level. So we have to find the right spot at the right balance where do we get into this. But in most of the geographies I mean the pricing environment, I would characterize it is getting positive. I mean, Emmanuel, talk about the Indonesia. On the other hand, we have a very strong rebound in volumes in Indonesia. And hopefully also Indonesia, which used to be quite important a significant contributor to the pricing will hopefully towards the end of this year or definitely 2023 will resume this pricing contribution. We had a price increase in Germany flowing through the market, the Philippines, Turkey, okay. Now Turkey goes to the hyper-inflationary accounting. We're trying to price it widely, looking at the inflation as the pressure. But as I said, at the beginning of the year we already started with the ahead of our own expectations pricing variance. So let's see how that this will continue through the year. Well, there is this continuous \u2013 remember this is the part of the world, which is still not out of the woods with regards to COVID unfortunately, right? So the situation is not really didn't get back to the pre-COVID side. I believe there is some underlying growth opportunities just by the fact that if they continue to recover from the COVID situation, we should start seeing the continuously better volume. And as I said, I mean we took the price increase in, Philippines, we're taking some pricing in, we're taking the pricing a little bit accelerated in Indonesia, but on the other hand, we are still in the \u2013 as you remember, Indonesia take a couple of around steps of a price increase to pass on the beginning of the excise increase. So we still need a bit of time to go into the net margin improvement territory. But it's very much hinges essentially to keep it short on continuous recovery and no further surprises with regards of the COVID situation. Okay, so thank you everyone for your attention and the patients and the quarter was pretty complex and complicated for us and since due to some technical problems the earnings call also can't somehow adjusted to the situations in the quarter. I have one on the comment toward everyone I hope is still on the line. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Nick Rolli, outstanding contribution to PMI and our former parent company over the past 35 years and particularly as the Vice President, Investor Relations since the 2008 Philip Morris International. As you all believe will agree with me, he has been a critical contributor through the journey of our company. And I know that you, our investors and analysts will join me in congratulating Nick and to wish him all the best for his very well deserved retirement. At the same time, I would also like to congratulate James Bushnell on his new role I have a pleasure because I personally was hiring Mr. Bushnell to PMI in his new role as the successor to Nick Rolli and I believe he would receive the same support and we welcome as Nick Rolli enjoy from you for the last 35 years. So welcome James, and thank you, Nick. See you soon, guys. Thank you."

            "name": "Emmanuel Babeau",
            "content": "Thank you, Jacek. We delivered a very strong performance in Q1, with double-digit organic net revenue and currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth on a pro forma basis, excluding Russia and Ukraine from both the current and prior year quarter. Overall currency-neutral results were also ahead of our expectations. Our IQOS business delivered an excellent quarter, continuing the reacceleration seen last quarter as device supply constraints continue to ease. Our IQOS user base grew by more than 1 million excluding Russia and Ukraine, marking a very strong performance. RRP pro forma net revenues grew by 23%, with pro forma smoke-free net revenues over 30% of the total company. Importantly, pro forma HTU shipment volumes grew plus 18% compared to the prior year quarter. This reflects excellent progress in the EU Region, continued growth in Japan as well as over 50% growth in low and middle income markets. PMI HTUs are now the second largest nicotine brand in markets where IQOS is present as our efforts on innovation, portfolio and geographic expansion drive consumer trial and adoption. The impressive start for IQOS ILUMA continues in Japan and Switzerland, with very encouraging initial take-up in our latest launch market of Spain. The initial success in these three very different markets reaffirms our confidence in ILUMA as an exciting future growth driver for our company. Meanwhile, our combustible business performed robustly, exceeding our objective of stable category share and delivering positive volume and organic net revenue growth. In addition to supporting strong financial performance, this also enhances our ability to maximize the switching of adult smokers to smoke-free alternatives. Overall, our business is off to a strong start and while currency is unfavorable in 2022, we expect to deliver another year of robust organic top and bottom line growth. Turning to the headline numbers, our Q1 net revenues grew organically by plus 9% in total and plus 10% on a pro forma basis. This reflects total volume growth driven by the underlying strength of IQOS, the ongoing recovery of the combustible business in many markets against a pandemic-affected comparison and some positive timing impacts, including inventory movements. Our total organic net revenue per unit grew 5.3% and by plus 4.9% on a pro forma basis, driven by the increasing proportion of IQOS HTUs in our sales mix, higher device volumes, and pricing. Combustible pricing was above expectations at plus 2.9% pro forma or around plus 6% also excluding Indonesia. Our total Q1 adjusted operating income margin declined organically by 30 basis points and by 40 basis points excluding Russia and Ukraine. This reflects a lower gross margin compared to a tough prior year comparison where productivity was higher mostly due to timing factors. As flagged in our full year earnings, Q1 margins were impacted by higher device sales for increasing IQOS user acquisition, channel replenishment and IQOS ILUMA. As mentioned previously, the unit cost and weight of ILUMA consumables and device cost is initially higher as we ramp up production, with improvement expected from next year. Inflation in certain elements of our supply chain, including energy, wages and direct materials and an increase in the use of air freight, was also exacerbated by the impact of the war in Ukraine. Despite these temporary margin challenges, we saw positive effects of the increasing size of IQOS, pricing, and cost efficiencies combined with our strong net revenue growth. This enabled us to deliver adjusted diluted EPS of $1.56, including unfavorable currency of $0.23, representing plus 14% currency-neutral growth. This was comfortably ahead of our currency-neutral expectations, even accounting for timing benefits of around $0.06. Excluding Russia and Ukraine, our pro forma adjusted diluted EPS of $1.46 grew by plus 16%. Turning now to our 2022 outlook. As Jacek mentioned, given the lack of visibility on Russia and Ukraine, we are now providing an adjusted outlook on a pro forma basis excluding these two markets for the entire year. With our underlying business reaccelerating, our growth fundamentals remain strong. Importantly, we expect to deliver organic net revenue growth of plus 4.5% to plus 6.5% compared to 2021 pro forma adjusted net revenues of $29.2 billion. This is above our previous forecast trajectory for total PMI, despite an approximate half-point drag from the shift to hyperinflationary accounting in Turkey. This range incorporates the risk of supply chain disruption for certain materials, a somewhat slower TEREA production capacity build-up due to the production cancellation in Russia, part of which was designated for export, the remaining uncertainty on full device availability, and the pace of the ongoing pandemic recovery. We expect our pro forma adjusted operating income margin to be organically zero to plus 100 basis points higher for the full year. As mentioned at full year results, we expect a lower gross margin as we invest in new innovations and incur temporarily higher unit and transportation costs for the fast growth of ILUMA. Since then, we have observed increased inflation in raw material and energy prices, and additional supply chain costs due to war-related disruptions including a temporary increase in air freight for both HTUs and select cigarette products. Higher expected device sales from the tremendous uptake of IQOS ILUMA, and easing of device supply constraints also have an initial dilutive margin impact. Despite these added headwinds, and a further expected COGS increase of around $300 million compared to our initial expectations we remain confident that we will achieve organic pro forma margin expansion as our strong revenue growth, favorable product mix and cost savings initiatives deliver sustainable accretion. We forecast pro forma currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 9% to plus 11%, also above our prior total PMI full year guidance. This translates into a pro forma adjusted diluted EPS range of $5.35 to $5.46, including an estimated unfavorable currency impact of around $0.63 at prevailing rates. This compared to our previous 2022 adjusted diluted EPS guidance of $6.12 to $6.30 provided in February, with the difference primarily reflecting the exclusion of Russia and Ukraine and an incremental unfavorable currency impact. The underlying IQOS growth outlook remains excellent. On a pro forma basis, we expect to deliver between 88 billion and 92 billion HTU shipment volumes, representing plus 20% to plus 25% growth over the pro forma prior year of 73.5 billion units. This excludes the nearly 5 billion units shipped in Russia and Ukraine in Q1, and while we conservatively assume no further such contribution from April 1, this implies a total outlook of 93 billion to 97 billion units for the year. We continue to expect pro forma HTU shipments to be modestly ahead of IMS for the year, after lagging behind in the second quarter as I'll explain later. As outlined in today's release, there are a number of other assumptions underpinning our outlook. We expect the total industry volume of cigarettes and HTUs, excluding Russia, Ukraine, U.S. and China, to decline by up to minus 1%. Given our leadership in smoke-free products, the structural growth of the category and its growing proportion in our business, as well as stabilizing share in combustibles, we expect to gain share. We therefore target positive total PMI pro forma shipment volumes, within a range of flat to plus 1%. We assume full year combustible pro forma pricing of around plus 3%, now including the adverse impact from hyperinflationary accounting in Turkey. The pricing environment is improving, including in Indonesia, although challenges remain due to ongoing pandemic-related impacts and disposable income pressures. Our other assumptions include around $10 billion in operating cash flow and a effective tax rate of 21% to 22%. We continue to expect full-year capital expenditures of around $1 billion. Despite the impact of the war in Ukraine, our balance sheet remains strong and we remain steadfastly committed to returning cash to shareholders through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. With regard to the phasing of pro forma performance this year, we expect a robust H1 overall, with margin expansion and adjusted diluted EPS growth weighted to the second half. In large part, this reflects the reacceleration of IQOS as device supply constraints ease, with a sharp recovery in device volumes as we replenish channel inventories for user acquisition and we supply the accelerated ILUMA replacement cycle in Japan. In addition, our average device price is lower than the prior year, reflecting stepped-up commercial activities to drive acquisition, including the broadening of our device portfolio with LIL and ILUMA ONE. While our devices continue to be priced at a meaningful premium to heavily discounted competitive offerings, we have already seen encouraging signs in stabilizing our high category share. Moreover, as we adjust our supply chain flows to prevailing global disruptions in various materials and logistic services, combined with the effects of the war in Ukraine, there may be a risk of short out-of-stock situations on certain cigarette SKUs in select markets, and we are making adjustments to some products to reflect the availability of specific materials. The reorganization of supply chain flows will contribute to the later timing of shipments to certain markets. We notably expect Q2 to be impacted by a number of temporary or specific factors, including the reversal of certain Q1 timing benefits. Organic pro forma net revenue growth is expected to be low single-digit, with other notable factors including the delayed timing of HTU and cigarette shipments to Japan with an approximate 2 point drag on growth, and a further impact from the shift to hyperinflationary accounting in Turkey, where the Q2 exchange rate comparison is accentuated. We expect total PMI pro forma HTU shipments of around 20 billion in Q2, partly reflecting around 3 billion less HTU shipments to Japan than originally planned. This compares to 18.7 billion pro forma in Q2, 2021. We expect these 3 billion units to move to H2, generating a further growth acceleration in the third and fourth quarters. For Q2 pro forma operating margins, the disproportionate impact of the catchup in device shipments will be accompanied by a corresponding step-up in commercial investments as we support the reacceleration of IQOS user acquisition over the coming quarters. In tandem with the negative mix impact of lower shipments to Japan, the highest expected quarterly increase in air freight costs of over $80 million, and other supply chain adjustment costs, we expect margins to contract further, before a significant recovery in the second half. These dynamics are reflected in our expectation of H1 pro forma adjusted diluted EPS of $2.65 to $2.70, including an unfavorable currency impact of $0.36 at prevailing rates. This represents currency-neutral growth of 5% to 7% compared to $2.86 in the prior year. In combination with our strong first quarter, H1 pro forma top line performance is expected to deliver organic growth of 5% to 7% overall. In H2, the powerful drivers of pricing, scale and efficiencies, and the receding of temporary cost headwinds, should outweigh inflationary pressures to deliver strong top line growth, organic margin expansion and an acceleration in bottom-line growth. Our strong 2022 outlook places us firmly on track to deliver our 2021, 2023 CAGR targets on a pro forma basis of more than 5% in organic net revenue growth, and more than 9% in currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth. We remain on track to deliver around $2 billion in gross cost savings by 2023, which is especially important given global inflationary pressures. Importantly, our ambition to become a majority smoke-free business by net revenues in 2025 remains intact. We remain confident in the rapid pace of our transformation. Turning back to our Q1 results, total shipment volumes increased by 3.5% on a total PMI basis and by 4.9% pro forma. This reflects continued strong broad based pro forma growth of plus 18.4% as user acquisition reaccelerates from the Q3 2021 supply-driven slowdown; and an increase of plus 3.2% in pro forma cigarette volumes reflecting the continued recovery of the total industry and of our category share. The transformation of our business towards smoke-free products continues at a rapid pace. Heated tobacco units comprised almost 13% of our total pro forma shipment volumes in the first quarter, as compared to 11.6% in full year 2021. Our sales mix is also evolving rapidly, as we become majority smoke free company. Smoke-free net revenues made up over 30% of our pro forma total in Q1, compared to 27.9% for full year 2021. IQOS devices accounted for approximately 6% of the $2.1 billion of Q1 RRP pro forma net revenues, reflecting higher year-over-year device volumes as supply constraints ease and ILUMA performs strongly. We delivered organic growth of plus 10% in Q1 pro forma net revenues on shipment volume growth of plus 4.9%. This growth reflects the twin engines driving our top line. The first is pricing, led by combustibles. The second is the increasing mix of regulatory projects in our business at higher net revenue per unit, which continues to deliver substantial growth; an increasingly powerful driver as our transformation accelerates. Let's now turn to the driver of our Q1 pro forma OI margin, which declined by 40 basis points. Our pro forma gross margin decreased organically by 250 basis points reflecting the factors I mentioned earlier. Conversely, our pro forma adjusted marketing, administration and research costs were 210 basis points better organically, due to the positive operating leverage of IQOS growth and successful cost efficiency programs. We generated around $180 million in gross cost savings in the first quarter, with around $80 million in COGS productivities and $100 million from SG&A. This makes over $1 billion since the start of 2021, already over halfway towards our target of around $2 billion for 2021, 2023. This allows us to reinvest in top line growth, and mitigate inflationary pressures while continuing to deliver solid margin progression. We continue to accelerate investment in our commercial programs, digital engine and R&D, as well as a number of growth opportunities across categories and geographies. As reflected in our full year guidance, we expect our operating margin progression to improve over the course of the year as temporary headwinds and tough comparisons ease. Our combustible portfolio performed well in Q1, with robust pro forma growth in volumes and organic net revenues. This notably reflects a further recovery in Indonesia and the Philippines, supporting an expectation of organic net revenue growth and broadly stable volumes in our South and Southeast Asia region this year. Increased travel also supported volume growth in Spain and Duty Free. Our share of the combustible category continued to recover with a plus 0.4 point pro forma gain in Q1 on a year-over-year basis. This includes gains in Japan, Turkey and Duty Free as our portfolio initiatives bear fruit and social consumption resumes with Marlboro share plus 0.3 points higher. While the category is declining over time, our leadership in combustibles helps to maximize switching to smoke-free products, and we continue to target a stable category share over time, despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization. In terms of our overall market share now, ongoing gains for our IQOS portfolio create continued positive momentum. We delivered pro forma share growth in Q1 as expected, including gains in Italy, Duty Free, Egypt, Germany and Poland. PMI HTUs are now the second largest nicotine brand in the markets where they are present with a 7.5% share excluding Russia and Ukraine. This includes the number one position in six markets. Moving now to the IQOS performance, we estimate there were approximately 17.9 million IQOS users as of March 31, excluding Russia and Ukraine, which had an estimated 4.8 million users at December 31, 2021. This reflects pro forma growth of more than 1 million users, a phenomenal performance by historic standards. This was driven by the resumption of consumer programs in many markets as device supply constraints receded, capitalizing on the strong underlying demand for the brand, as also evident in the very impressive start of IQOS ILUMA. We estimate that 71% of total IQOS users outside Russia and Ukraine or 12.7 million adult smokers have switched to IQOS and stopped smoking, with the balance in various stages of conversion. We were also very encouraged by the FDA's recent MRTP order for IQOS 3, with the full range of authorized IQOS products now classified as modified risk tobacco products. In the EU Region, first quarter HTU share reached 7.6% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume, representing a first quarter share gain of 2 points, including a small benefit from the timing of inventory movements. Adjusted IMS volumes also continue to exhibit robust sequential growth, and we expect this to continue in the second quarter, noting that the usual seasonality of the combustible market combined with the reversal of Q1 inventory movements is expected to result in a lower sequential share in Q2. This very good performance includes strong user and volume growth across the region, with especially notable contributions from Italy and Poland. I also want to again highlight Hungary and Lithuania where our Q1 national HTU share exceeded 25%. To give some further color on our progress in the EU Region, this slide shows a selection of the latest key city offtake shares. While Vilnius continues to lead the way, approaching 40% share; Budapest, Rome and Athens are also well into the mid-to-high 20s. Elsewhere, we are especially pleased by Vienna more than doubling to 5%, the strong traction in London at over 6% share, and a further acceleration in Zurich with the introduction of ILUMA. In Japan, the adjusted share for our HTU brands increased by plus 1.9 points to a record 22.7% in Q1. This performance reflects the strength of our portfolio and the launch of IQOS ILUMA, which is also driving notable gains in Tokyo and other key cities. We expect strong offtake trends to continue in Q2, reaching around 24% market share, despite seasonality effects. Conversely, as I touched on earlier, supply chain constraints will likely result in Q2 HTU shipments below the prior year. With HTU inventories consequently reduced in the second quarter, we expect the replenishment in H2 to deliver a substantial recovery. Notwithstanding such quarterly volatility, with substantial commercial activities planned and excellent underlying momentum, we expect strong double-digit HTU shipment volume growth in Japan this year. In addition to strong progress in developed countries, we see very promising IQOS growth in low and middle income markets. The share of our HTU brands in the 28 such markets launched by December 31, 2021, excluding Russia and Ukraine, grew by plus 0.8 points compared to the prior year to reach 2.7%. Given the large size of these markets, the premium positioning of the existing IQOS portfolio and the relatively early stage of commercialization, this represents excellent progress. As mentioned last quarter we also intend to bring a new complementary range of heat-not-burn devices and HTUs tailored to emerging markets towards the end of this year. A prime example of this is Egypt, where offtake exit share in Cairo is approaching 5% within 8 months of launch, as compared to total Q1 share of 4.3%. Other notable successes including the recently launched market of Morocco as well as Lebanon, Jordan, the Dominican Republic and the Philippines, despite pandemic restrictions in Manila. Moving now to IQOS ILUMA, we are delighted to report the further outstanding success since its launch, with sales performance and consumer reactions still exceeding our expectations. In Japan, the uptake of ILUMA devices and consumables among both existing IQOS users and legal-age smokers has been rapid, with more than 30% of the large user base up-trading since the August 2021 launch, and over 20% of sales remain to legal-age smokers new to IQOS. Moreover, the enhanced and consistently high quality user experience, better reliability and no need for cleaning has led to significant observed increases in conversion rates, retention rates and Net Promoter Score. This bodes well for volumes, with premium-priced TEREA consumables the fastest growing launch in the smoke-free category, reaching an offtake share of 12% within six months of national launch; overtaking Marlboro Heatsticks and HEETS combined to become the number one smoke-free brand. We now have all three IQOS ILUMA devices in the market following the launch of ILUMA ONE, which provides multiple consecutive use at a more affordable price points. We are also introducing a new HTU brand called SENTIA for use with ILUMA, in select prefectures at a mainline price point comparable to HEETS. Results in Switzerland have again been even more remarkable, with significant sales to new users, and TEREA making up almost two-thirds of HTU sales after only five months of commercialization. Our HTU share growth has accelerated from less than 6% in Q3 to 9% this quarter, with notable success in the German-speaking majority of the country. Our newest ILUMA launch was in Spain last month. While very early days the signs are also very positive with device sales to new users increasing 50% compared to the prior run rate, 10% of existing users upgraded within the first month, and TEREA exiting March at over one quarter of total HTU offtake. These results across three markets with differing consumer characteristics and level of RRP maturity are clearly very encouraging for the wider roll-out of ILUMA around the world. While device supply constraints are easing, the timing of HTU availability for new ILUMA markets has been somewhat delayed given the rapid uptake in the initial markets, and the resulting need for greater supply for each new market than was originally anticipated. In addition, the cancellation of our investment in the production of TEREA HTUs in our Russian facility has a short-term impact. As a result, further market launches are now mostly expected towards the end of H2. With ILUMA, IQOS 3 DUO and LIL, we now have three heat-not-burn technologies under the IQOS umbrella to serve different consumer needs and segment the market. We have an exciting pipeline of innovation on devices and consumables at different price tiers. In e-vapor, IQOS VEEV's promising results in the first group of markets continue. VEEV is a premium proposition, with an average price premium to competitive devices of 20% to 30%, making these results especially encouraging as we pursue a differentiated and profitable category leadership position over time. We see further success in Italy reaching almost 20% offtake share of closed system pods, with rapid progress also visible in Croatia within eight months of launch. In the Czech Republic, after some temporary supply disruption at the start of the quarter which affected Q1 share, rapid growth has resumed. VEEV was present in seven markets at March 31, and we plan to add more this year, with timing subject to device availability. Separately, our re-launched commercialization of nicotine pouches under the Shiro brand in the Nordics is progressing well, with positive consumer feedback. Moving to sustainability and our ESG priorities, I'm happy to share two important developments published in our 2022 proxy statement. Firstly, our Board of Directors updated our company's statement of purpose, expanding it beyond smoke-free, to better reflect the role of wellness and healthcare in our corporate strategy and transformation. Second, the introduction of a bespoke Sustainability Index explicitly links our ESG performance to 30% of long-term compensation. Further details will be shared in our Integrated Report on May 17, and further dedicated disclosures. Product health impact remains one of our most critical ESG priorities, and the growing penetration of smoke-free products around the world is accelerating the end of cigarettes, as legal-age smokers switch to better alternatives. There is a growing body of scientific and real-world evidence of the substantial risk reduction potential of smoke-free products compared with smoking. While challenges in some markets are to be expected, we continue to support regulatory and fiscal frameworks that recognize the positive impact tobacco harm reduction policies can have on public health. A recent example of this is Italy, which has established distinct excise tax categories for heatnot-burn, e-vapor and nicotine pouches. Thank you. And I'll now turn it back to Jacek. Hi, Chris. And Chris maybe just to complement, I think it's really important that everybody understand the evolution of the gross margin in Q1, Q2 and H1 versus H2. I'm sure you remember that last year, the gross margin in H1 was extremely high, we were at 70%. The gross margin was lower and probably more normative in H2. So what we have seen in Q1 was first of all facing very high comps. I think we've been describing in the presentation, the various driver for the 250 basis point reduction in the gross margin. What you can expect for Q2 is this element to continue knowing that the gross margin reference is 70% as well last year in Q2. And on top of it, we will have more device sales even than in Q1, which I think is good news because it shows the success of IQOS. We have increased air freight cost for the reason that we mentioned and the tension on the supply chain and that's going to have an impact on the margin. And last element, you have this mix, which is a temporary element of course like air freight, by the way on the fact that the volume will be lower for Japan in Q2 with the recovery and the compensation in H2. And with that, you have the reason for increased pressure, gross margin pressure in Q2, but with the compensation that will come in H2. And Pamela, on your question on how do we get to more than 50% in 2025. I'm sure you've seen that in Q1, on a pro forma basis excluding Russia and Ukraine we are a bit below the full perimeter of the Group, but not that much below. So we are at 30% versus around 31%. So, yes, there is a bit more ground to cover to get to 50%. But given the dynamism that we see in our IQOS business and the opportunity we've been clearly showing in low-and middle-income country, we think we can catch up and deliver this more than 50%. Thank you. Yeah, Vivien if I may, Emmanuel speaking. It's a positive in the mix within the device, because it come at a higher price. But any growth in device is negative to the mix in term of gross margin, because it's coming with of course a much reduced gross margin versus the consumables. So the more device we sell, you have some impact on the revenue, which is positive, but it has a dilutive impact on the gross margin rate to be very clear. And Jared, as we said, we expect to grow nicely revenue in the region this year, which would be a very nice evolution. Thank you."

I\u2019m joined today by Jacek Olczak, Chief Executive Officer, and Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer. Over to you, Jacek.\nJacek Olczak: Thank you, James, and welcome everyone. PMI delivered another strong operating performance in 2023. We achieved our third consecutive year of positive volumes and high single-digit organic top line growth, driven by smoke-free products. Smoke-free products delivered accelerated accretion to profitability in the fourth quarter, as our IQOS business delivered meaningful 2023 operating leverage, mitigating a significant drag from combustibles. I am also very pleased to report the continued outstanding growth of ZYN, which was not included in organic metrics until mid-November. Importantly, smoke-free products reached nearly 40% of total PMI net revenues in the fourth quarter and over 40% of gross profit. For the year, smoke-free gross profit increased by 19% organically and we expect smoke-free organic growth to accelerate for both net revenues and gross profit in 2024. ZYN delivered exceptional growth in its first year within PMI with U.S. pro forma volumes up by over 60% for the year and over 75% in the quarter four. Oral smoke-free is accretive to both our smoke-free business and the overall group, with Swedish Match contributing 50 basis points organic uplift to Q4 OI margins from only 50 days of the period. Our IQOS business continues to deliver excellent results with 15% adjusted in-market sales growth for heated tobacco units reflecting broad-based momentum in Europe, Japan, and emerging markets. The rollout of IQOS ILUMA is substantially complete, now present in 51 markets representing over 95% of IQOS geographies by volume excluding Russia and Ukraine.  The superior experience and design of ILUMA combined with the strong premium brand equity of IQOS and our unrivalled commercial infrastructure enabled IQOS to outgrow the heat-not-burn category, despite holding a category share of over 75%. Importantly, as we have seen in Japan, the launch of ILUMA is a multiyear growth driver consistent with past IQOS innovations. Our 2023 combustible performance was margin dilutive despite strong commercial results, with very good pricing and higher category share. This reflects the significant cost pressures in the category, geographic mix from volume growth in lower margin markets without smoke-free products, and the impact of IQOS cannibalization. This was also compounded by the technical impact of third-party manufacturing in Indonesia and Ukraine. While cost and currency headwinds impacted our earnings in 2023, the strengthening growth and margin profile of smoke-free products set us up well to deliver sustainable growth and returns including currency in 2024 and beyond. We reached a number of key transformation milestones in Q4. First, IQOS net revenues surpassed Marlboro to become the number one international nicotine brand on this measure. This demonstrates the power of innovative smoke-free alternatives to switch adult smokers away from cigarettes, and to address the societal issue of combustible tobacco. It is also testament to our organization\u2019s ability to build strong and sustainable brand equity. This also applies to ZYN, the fastest growing U.S. smoke-free brand with another outstanding performance in Q4, marked by an increase in category volume share, retail value share, and overall volumes. We are also proud to have reached 25 markets where smoke-free products exceed 50% of our top line for both Q4 and the full year. We aim to reach 60 markets by 2030, driving our ambition to exceed two-thirds of group net revenues. Last, as I already mentioned, over 40% of our total gross profit was generated by smoke-free products with the adjusted gross margin rate on smoke-free surpassing combustibles for both the quarter and year. We are encouraged by the increasing number of governments adopting tobacco harm reduction policies to encourage reduced risk nicotine consumption instead of smoking, which is ultimately more sustainable for society. Nevertheless, a considerable amount of work remains. Sustainable growth requires a sustainable business, and we continue to garner increasing recognition for our sustainability performance across the key product and operational topics for our company. PMI was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the first time, and for the fourth year in a row DJSI North America. In addition, PMI was awarded carbon disposal projects Triple A rating for the fourth consecutive year. I will now hand it over to Emmanuel to discuss our results and outlook in more detail.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Jacek. Let\u2019s start with the headline numbers. We finished the year strongly with Q4 organic net revenue growth of 8.3%. This includes 14% growth from smoke-free products despite slower HTU shipment growth due to comparison effects, and also 5% growth from combustibles. Pricing was a strong driver for both categories, with smoke-free pricing including the impact of retail price increases on HTUs. While Swedish Match was only included in organic metrics as of November 12, it contributed 0.8 percentage points to Q4 organic top line growth and grew by an excellent 26% on a pro forma basis. Operating income grew organically by a very good 8%, including a Swedish Match contribution of 2.2 points. As expected, Q4 margins were broadly stable organically, and grew excluding the technical effects mentioned by Jacek. This enabled our business to deliver another quarter of double-digit currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth at 12.2%. This exceeded our prior expectations with ZYN\u2019s remarkable growth a notable contributor. Despite this strong currency-neutral result, Q4 adjusted diluted EPS of $1.36 was adversely affected by a greater than expected currency impact of $0.20. This includes a $0.09 balance sheet related impact under hyperinflationary accounting in Argentina, following the devaluation of the peso in mid-December. As with the previously mentioned impact in Q3, this reflects the depreciation of monetary net assets denominated in pesos, which are subject to capital controls. By its nature, this does not carry forward to future periods. Turning to the full year. Net revenues grew by plus 7.8% organically, representing the third straight year of high single-digit growth. Similar to Q4, this reflects continued excellent IQOS momentum and strong combustible pricing. In 2023, Swedish Match, led by ZYN, grew pro forma ex-currency net revenues by 20%. Operating income grew by plus 3.7% organically, reflecting a challenging first half followed by strong growth in H2. We delivered expansion in both adjusted gross margins and operating income margins in H2, driven by the strong progress of smoke-free products. With the impact of accelerated device sales from the ILUMA rollout in the base and a return to sea freight to Japan, the effects of growing HTU volumes and ongoing cost optimization are clearly visible. As expected, OI margins organically contracted 150 basis points for the full year, primarily due to acute cost and supply chain headwinds in H1. As flagged in prior quarters, full year margins include a 40 basis point headwind from the accounting treatment of third-party manufacturing in Indonesia and Ukraine, primarily reflecting the Indonesia excise tax gross up of around $250 million growth in both net revenues and cost of sales. While headwinds in combustibles have not fully abated, our smoke-free business is delivering excellent profit growth, and our organic results will include the strong contributions from Swedish Match going forward. We successfully mitigated inflationary pressures and supported investments with efficiencies. Across our total operating cost base, we delivered an incremental $100 million in gross cost efficiencies in Q4, and $2.2 billion for 2021/2023 overall, surpassing our $2 billion target. We target an additional $2 billion over the next three years. These positive factors allowed us to deliver very strong currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 11%, ahead of our prior expectations. Adjusted diluted EPS of $6.01 includes unfavorable currency of $0.63, primarily reflecting the Japanese yen, Russian ruble, and specific Argentine peso dynamics I just explained. We include a slide in the appendix to this presentation with more detail. Focusing now on volumes. We comfortably achieved a third consecutive year of shipment growth driven by a 15% increase for IQOS HTUs, in addition to a resilient combustible performance. Our smoke-free volumes made up over 20% of total PMI in Q4, and with continued mid-teens or better growth expected here, we are very well-positioned to continue growing volumes over the mid and long-term. 2023 HTU shipment volumes of 125.3 billion units were at the lower end of our targeted range due to delayed launches in Saudi Arabia and Taiwan, combined with lower-than-expected underlying growth in Russia and Ukraine. For IQOS HTUs, we believe the best indicator of underlying growth is adjusted IMS, as the closest metric to consumer offtake. For the full year, adjusted in-market volumes and shipment growth were in line at plus 15%. In the fourth quarter, HTU shipment growth of 6% reflects trade inventory build-up in the prior year quarter and the plus 14% adjusted IMS growth is therefore a more reliable measure of continued strong growth momentum. Excluding Russia and Ukraine, adjusted in-market sales grew by more than plus 17% for the year. For context, across the two years before the war began in 2022 these markets made up 23% of HTU shipment volumes and exceeded the company\u2019s growth rate by a notable margin. These smoke-free volume growth rates exclude the excellent development of our oral nicotine portfolio driven by ZYN, with shipment volumes up by plus 23% in Q4 and plus 17% in 2023 on a pro forma basis. Cigarette shipments declined by a modest 1.4% in 2023, outperforming the international category decline of 2.4%. Turning to profits. Organic operating income growth stepped up in H2 to plus 10% following the exceptional headwinds of H1. We believe this is more representative of the underlying momentum of our business, and in line with our 2024/2026 CAGR target range of plus 8% to 10%. Focusing now on some key drivers of our full year operating income, smoke-free gross profit grew organically by an excellent plus 19%, expanding gross margins by 340 basis points. This reflects part of the operating leverage of IQOS I already mentioned, with a notable contribution from Swedish Match oral nicotine in the last 50 days of Q4 with organic operating profit growth of over 50%. With smoke-free commercial costs also increasing by less than net revenues, this clearly bodes well for 2024 as we continue to benefit from scale effects and manufacturing optimization. Despite very strong pricing there was only marginal organic growth in combustible gross profits. This partly reflects the negative geographic mix I already mentioned, with greater volume declines in higher margin markets like Japan as adult smokers switch to smoke-free products, and better volume trends in lower margin geographies where smoke-free products are small or not available such as Turkey. There were also significant inflationary pressures on leaf, direct materials and other manufacturing costs. Cost increases on leaf, where inventories cover multiple crop years, and wages are likely to carry over into 2024, and should ease thereafter. Moving now to Swedish Match, which delivered outstanding performance in its first full year as part of PMI, with adjusted pro forma currency neutral top line growth of 26% in Q4 and 20% in 2023. When we announced our offer for Swedish Match in 2022, we targeted a return on investment in excess of our cost of capital within five years. With the growth of ZYN surpassing our expectations, we now expect to achieve this well ahead of time. ZYN delivered another remarkable U.S. performance with plus 78% volume growth in Q4 and 62% in 2023. Internationally, we have launched or relaunched ZYN in 10 markets as planned, as we continue to focus on building a truly global brand. U.S. cigars posted robust 2023 results, growing net revenues and profits. This was driven by strong pricing following an increase in April, partially offset by volume declines which reflect lagged competitor pricing and comparison effects. ZYN\u2019s excellent U.S progress continued in Q4 with 15% sequential growth in 12-month rolling shipments. Impressively, category volume share grew for the third consecutive quarter to 72.8%, an increase of plus 5.4 points year-on-year and plus 2 points sequentially. Retail value share also grew during the quarter to 77.4%, highlighting ZYN\u2019s premium positioning and superior brand equity. This accelerated growth again reflects a broad step-up in nationwide store velocities and gradual distribution expansion as the category gains strong traction with adult nicotine users for its convenience and pleasurable experience. Now focusing on IQOS, starting with user growth. We estimate there were 28.6 million IQOS users as of December 31st, representing growth of 1.2 million users in the quarter and 3.7 million for the full year, a nice acceleration compared to 2022. This includes notable progress in Japan and Europe, in addition to a broad range of other geographies. ILUMA is now available in essentially all major markets outside Russia and Ukraine, with over 17 million estimated adult users as of December 31, 2023. This reflects the switching of existing IQOS users and the acquisition of adult smokers. We expect ILUMA to drive continued strong IQOS user growth in 2024 and beyond. Considering the seasonal fluctuations and volatility in quarterly user estimation, we plan to report this metric on a semi-annual basis going forward. With the addition of ZYN to our portfolio, and a smaller, but growing VEEV e-vapor business, we also intend to provide a more holistic view of our total smoke-free user base to investors. Moving now to IQOS in the Europe region, where smoke-free products made up more than 45% of Q4 net revenues. Our Q4 adjusted HTU share increased by plus 1.2 points to 9.6% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume. A key driver is the growing uptake of ILUMA, which is available to around 90% of IQOS users in the region after eight further launches during the quarter. In the EU, 11 markets making up nearly 30% of regional IQOS volumes adopted the delegated directive to implement a characterizing flavor ban on heated tobacco products and implemented clean-shelf policies in October. While still early days, we estimate only a small impact on offtake as consumers adjust, as well as on trade inventory levels. Indeed, adjusted IMS volumes continue to exhibit very good sequential growth and reached a record high 12.4 billion units on a four-quarter moving average. This reflects double-digit year-on-year progression of plus 13% in Q4, despite the lack of growth in Ukraine. We expect the remaining EU markets to adopt the characterizing flavor ban in 2024 and estimate a full year consumer adjustment impact of around 2 billion units on both shipment and IMS, representing less than 5% of regional volumes and less than 2% of total PMI. This is consistent with other past flavor restrictions, such as the EU ban applied to combustibles in 2020. Based on the initial data from markets that have enacted the ban, our fundamental view remains the same. We do not expect a meaningful change in the structural trajectory of the category, and indeed expect Europe adjusted IMS progression to be broadly in line with the group growth rate in 2024. Europe is also an important geography for innovation. LEVIA zero-tobacco HTUs were launched in the Czech Republic in mid-October through limited channels with an encouraging initial response. We plan a broader Czech rollout later this month and further market launches this year. In Japan, the heat-not-burn category now represents close to 40% of the total industry, with IQOS driving its growth and reaching over 8.5 million adult users. In Q4, the adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by 3.1 points to 27.6% with off-take share surpassing 34% in Tokyo. Adjusted IMS volumes increased by 14.5% year-over-year for 2023 and 13.4% in Q4 alone, reaching a record high of almost 10 billion units on a four-quarter moving average. Such impressive growth in a market with already high category penetration is a clear testament to the sustainable potential of IQOS around the world. HTU shipment volumes returned to a more normalized state in the fourth quarter as compared to a tough prior year inventory comparison, following the substantial completion of the transition back to sea freight in Q3. In addition to strong IQOS share gains in developed countries, we continue to see very promising growth in low and middle income markets. This slide highlights a selection of Q4 key city off-take shares across markets in Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Egypt continues to impress with Cairo off-take share up plus 3 points to 9.4%, also noting encouraging results elsewhere in the region such as Morocco and Lebanon. Indonesia also saw notable progress in its capital city, especially given limited commercialization. We continue to see dynamic off-take volume growth across these important future markets, with the city shares towards the right of this chart an indication of the exciting potential. While we have already covered the margin dynamics on combustibles, our 2023 commercial performance was very robust with organic top line growth of plus 5.5%. This reflects both strong pricing, with notable contributions from Germany and Indonesia, and positive share performance within a resilient international category. Our cigarette category share grew by plus 0.1 points in Q4 and plus 0.2 points in 2023 with notable contributions from Egypt, Poland, and Turkey. Although flattered by competitor supply constraints in Egypt, which may normalize in 2024, we again achieved our ongoing objective of stable category share excluding this effect, despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization. This remains key as our leadership in combustibles helps to maximize switching to smoke-free products. This combustible share performance combined with the structural growth of IQOS led to an increase of plus 0.6 points of international cigarette and HTU share for the full year. As mentioned previously, our superior share of smoke-free products gives us a formidable platform for sustainable share gains, with superior unit economics. Before we turn to the 2024 outlook, let me briefly reflect on our strong delivery over the past three years, in spite of a number of substantial headwinds. The performance was clearly positive compared to our currency neutral 2021/2023 targets of more than 5% organic top line and more than 9% bottom line growth, supported by overall growing volumes. For the next three years we target a similar strong volume delivery, a plus 6% to 8% organic net revenue CAGR, and a step-up in organic operating income growth to plus 8% to 10%. We target an adjusted EPS CAGR of plus 9% to 11% ex-currency growth at constant 2023 corporate tax rates, including an increase in net financing costs which skews towards the first year of the period in 2024. Okay. This brings me to the outlook for 2024, where we expect a strong acceleration in smoke-free performance across IQOS volumes, smoke-free net revenues and gross profit. We forecast the highest ever absolute increase in HTU adjusted IMS volumes to deliver plus 14% to plus 16% growth in percentage terms, despite the inclusion of an estimated impact of around 2 billion units from consumer adjustment to the EU characterizing flavor ban I mentioned earlier, and essentially no off-take growth in Russia. For shipment volumes, we target more than 140 billion units, subject to the usual inherent volatility of shipment timing, new market launches and potential supply chain disruptions, such as the ongoing situation in the Red Sea. While shipment growth rates naturally follow adjusted IMS over time, there is a possibility of some lower inventory levels compared to 2023 given the substantial completion of ILUMA launches and opportunities for working capital optimization. We expect continued excellent U.S. ZYN volume growth to around 520 million cans. We have also accelerated our capacity expansion plans to support this further significant step-up in volumes and to manage inventory levels, which are naturally affected by the recent level of growth. Such a strong outlook for IQOS and ZYN means we expect to deliver an acceleration in organic smoke-free top line growth compared to 2023, reaching close to $15 billion in net revenues at prevailing exchange rates. This supports a total PMI forecast of plus 6.5% to plus 8% organic net revenue progression, including a fourth consecutive year of total volume growth and mid-single digit combustible pricing. We also forecast an acceleration in smoke-free gross profit growth from the organic plus 19% delivered in 2023 as IQOS profitability expands and ZYN\u2019s excellent economics continue. We expect smoke-free to again drive the lion\u2019s share of our forecast organic OI growth of plus 8% to plus 9.5%, notably given the enduring cost pressures and negative geographic mix in combustibles I just mentioned. This naturally implies organic margin expansion, even factoring in the ongoing technical dilution impact of third-party manufacturing in Indonesia. We expect a meaningful organic improvement in overall gross margins excluding technical impacts, and a very limited currency impact on adjusted OI margins. This forecast includes notable capability investments in the U.S., but as mentioned at Investor Day we still expect to deliver strong double-digit operating income growth in this market. As flagged at last year\u2019s Investor Day, we anticipate an increased net financing expense this year as debt is renewed at higher rates. We forecast a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, as compared to $1.1 billion in 2023. We also assume a higher effective corporate tax rate due to Russia\u2019s suspension of certain double tax treaties and earnings mix. These tax and interest factors combined impact our currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth projection by around 2 percentage points. Accordingly, we forecast currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 7% to plus 9%. This translates into an adjusted diluted EPS range of $6.32 to $6.44, including an unfavorable currency impact of $0.11 at prevailing rates. This notably includes a net favorable impact of $0.13 related to the revaluation of monetary balances in hyperinflationary economies in 2023, skewed to the second half comparison. Moving to the shape of expected 2024 performance on a quarterly basis, we anticipate good double-digit growth in adjusted IMS HTU growth every quarter supporting the full year forecast of plus 14% to plus 16%. We forecast a strong Q1 overall with HTU shipment volumes of 31 billion to 32 billion and continued strong volume growth from ZYN. We expect organic top line and operating income growth to be broadly consistent with the full year outlook, which implies organic margin expansion as with the full year. We project strong Q1 currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 7% to plus 10%. This translates to a range of $1.37 to $1.42, including a negative currency variance of $0.10 at prevailing rates, with currency comparisons improving in the second half as we lap the Argentina impacts of 2023. Our business remains highly cash generative. However, the $9.2 billion in 2023 operating cash flow was lower than expected. This was due to currency effects on net earnings including the Argentine peso devaluation, other year-end currency impacts and higher-than-expected working capital needs. In 2024, we target between $10 billion and $11 billion in operating cash flow at prevailing exchange rates and subject to working capital requirements. We continue to prioritize investing in innovation and the growth of our smoke-free portfolio. In 2024, we expect capital expenditures of around $1.2 billion including the ZYN capacity expansion I just mentioned. Deleveraging remains a key priority for us, and as expected our 2023 net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was around three times given the 2023 purchase of the remaining Swedish Match minorities and the final U.S. IQOS payment to Altria. We target much better progress of 0.3 to 0.5 times deleverage in 2024, driven by continued EBITDA growth and strong cash flow generation. We continue to target a ratio of around two times by the end of 2026, with buybacks to be considered once confirmed we are on track. Finally, our commitment to our progressive dividend policy is unwavering and in line with our long-term commitment to return cash to shareholders. I'll now turn it back to Jacek for concluding remarks.\nJacek Olczak: Thank you, Emmanuel. Let me now take a moment to cover our key strategic priorities for 2024. First is supporting the sustained growth momentum of IQOS through continuous innovation. This includes leveraging the rollout of ILUMA to maximize user growth, while innovating further on both devices and consumables. Second is to continue the strong U.S. growth of ZYN, supported by targeted commercial investment, long-term capacity expansion and organizational infrastructure, which will also support IQOS. Outside the U.S., we intend to continue developing our integrated multi-category offering to adult nicotine users with further launches of ZYN and, where relevant, our VEEV e-vapor portfolio. Of course, 2024 will be a landmark year for IQOS in the U.S. While the ultimate launch of IQOS ILUMA is the main priority, we continue to prepare for the first city tests of the IQOS 3 blade product starting in Q2 this year. These small-scale pilot launches will allow us to experiment with different aspects of commercialization and support our drive for at-scale commercial success once ILUMA is authorized. While we have no update on the expected PMTA timeline, the patent settlement agreement announced last week allows for commercialization of both blade and induction products while mitigating risks of patent-related disruption and enables us to leverage the scale, optimized cost and flexibility of our global supply chain. In combustibles, we continue to target a stable category share over time despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization, while taking judicious pricing actions to drive a positive profit contribution. Our capital allocation priorities are crystal clear. We will continue to invest in the growth of smoke-free products, and our commitment to the dividend remains steadfast. Following the acquisition of Swedish Match, deleveraging remains our key balance sheet objective. We aim to continue our excellent progress on sustainability initiatives, including those related to product impact such as youth access prevention and post-consumer waste. Finally, and importantly, we remain committed to transforming the tobacco harm reduction landscape by providing superior alternatives to adult smokers who would otherwise continue smoking and advocating for science-based regulations. We will be expanding further on many of these topics at the CAGNY conference in two weeks\u2019 time. Let me now conclude today\u2019s presentation. Overall, our business delivered a strong 2023 performance in the face of notable cost headwinds, driven by structural smoke-free momentum. The continued excellent performance of IQOS and remarkable growth of ZYN strengthened their positions as leading brands with excellent equity. Combined with our unrivalled commercial and innovative capabilities, we have a powerful platform to expedite our smoke-free future as we broaden our portfolio and reach to adult smokers. We expect 2024 to be a year of accelerated growth for smoke-free products and remain confident in our 2024-2026 growth targets. We have exciting opportunities in the U.S. and internationally, which we are fully dedicated to capture as we progress towards our ambition of being sustainably smoke-free by 2030. Finally and importantly, our strong growth outlook and highly cash-generative business underpins our ability to deleverage while returning cash to shareholders. Thank you. And Emmanuel and I are now happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: Hi, everyone. I actually wanted to ask a high-level question on the year. You originally guided FX-neutral EPS growth in '23 of 7% to 9%. Yet, you really did finish out the year a lot stronger, reporting 11% currency-neutral EPS growth. So as you look back, what were some of the key areas of outperformance versus your initial expectations? And then as you think about this year, you're initially guiding to 7% to 9% FX-neutral EPS growth again. So just trying to understand how conservative this may be, especially considering your 9% to 11% midterm growth target?\nJacek Olczak: So Bonnie, with regards to 2023, I think the momentum which we have in the category is in Japan, is really well worth singling out. And despite the fact that as you know IQOS occupies a very sizable part of the segment, I mean where we capture well above our segments, I think we captured about 80% of the entire segment growth in Japan. So this is very strong. Japan is on the forefront of a smoke-free transformation. We're approaching the year 10 anniversary of IQOS in Japan. And if I just look over the last few weeks how category is continuously expansions in Japan, I think in the Tokyo area, the smoke-free products now about exceeded the size of the cigarette category. So if IQOS continues after 10 years participating in this phenomenal growth, this is really worth singling out. Clearly, ZYN and as we indicated very much, we've been very keen and very pleased that we could conclude the acquisition of Swedish Match, that adds the important element of our portfolio of alternative smoking, the pouches and obviously, creates a very good opening for us in entering the U.S. market and that ZYN is clearly is growing above their expectations. What is very important is we hear from time-to-time, quite rightly, conversations about some unintended consequences about the use of the product. I am so pleased with both IQOS and with ZYN actually are delivering of as they were designed for, i.e. going after adult smokers in the U.S. above 21 years. We're all familiar with the CDC data, less than 80% youth usage, the same is for IQOS and international. So we have a good -- my view is we have a very good, sustainable growing two fabulous propositions in a smoke-free product, and we're also trying here to be very focused from a financial perspective with regards to the e-vape. So right now, if we roll this forward to 2024, I think that Japan is on the good momentum. ZYN in the U.S. continues this momentum. Europe is going very strongly very well. Yes, we have this distortion maybe potential headwinds we're getting there. We very clearly indicated the $2 billion potential impact from the flavor ban in the EU.  But other than that, these key geographies and these key geographies also are very important from the margin perspective expansion, they really are on the positive side. And I don't want to sound negative on the rest of the world. However, one thing you should note that, on occasions, there might be some conversations around the growth trajectory of IQOS and so on. And you remember during Investors Day, I've been very clear. We're running IQOS 10 consecutive years of fabulous growth despite the fact that we essentially lost any growth, access to any growth in Russia and Ukraine. And historically, I mean, Russia alone was delivering, and depends how you now -- which period you pick up, but easily above the 4 billion maybe even 5 billion per annum growth of the category. So I think we need to look at this trajectory from this perspective, which makes me even more confident about our 3-year outlook.\nBonnie Herzog: Okay. Thank you. That was helpful. And then I did want to ask a little bit more on margins. Just hoping for a little bit more color on your margins in Q4, especially in Americas, where they were actually negative. I'm assuming, I think you called this out, a key driver of this is your investments ahead of the IQOS relaunch in the U.S. in May. So in the context of this, how should we think about operating income growth in Americas this year? Will it continue to be negative? And then for the full year of '24 year, just total company, your guidance is for FX-neutral revenue growth and operating income growth does imply operating margin expansion. So could you maybe touch on your expectations for gross margin and OpEx in the context of that?\nJacek Olczak: Yes, Bonnie, Emmanuel can chip in a little more details. I think in the Americas segment, where it's more the impact of the devaluation in Argentina which drove the margins down rather than the U.S. market. Specifically about the U.S. market, yes, there is the increased investment also to continue supporting ZYN growth, and ZYN expansion, but also in preparing Swedish Match organization or Philip Morris International in the U.S. organization for being able to handle IQOS soon and obviously have the organizations, which is after the opportunities and the challenges of the U.S. market. So there are some investments which are already flowing through the P&L even ahead of the IQOS process start of the commercialization. Emmanuel, do you want to?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes, just to complement -- to answer your question, Bonnie, and complement what Jacek was saying on what is behind the higher-than-expected performance for '23. Clearly, as I described, a very strong dynamic on the volume on the commercial dimension, if you want. But we've been very pleased as well with the development of our margin on our smoke-free product. And we are today seeing the margin both on IQOS and on ZYN being above the average margin on CC. We are making progress on the profitability of the IQOS product and we have some price increase in Q4 overall. So that was the planned dynamic, but it is happening maybe even a bit better than what we're expecting, and we expect that to continue in Q4. And in that perspective, I mean, clearly, the U.S. is a fantastic market. We've described the fact that the margin of ZYN in the U.S. is best-in-class among our portfolio of products. And therefore, make no mistake, even if indeed, we're going to continue to invest in the U.S., the U.S. is going to be super nicely accretive in all parameters of our P&L at the level of the, of course, revenue growth but also at the level of the margin evolution and at the level of the operating income. And we reflect the fact that we talk about double-digit growth and very strong double-digit growth. U.S. is a very powerful contributor to our financial performance.\nBonnie Herzog: Okay. Emmanuel, if I may just clarify something then. For this year, you are expecting gross margin and possibly op margin expansion? Based on your guidance, it implies op margin.\nJacek Olczak: Yes. We do absolutely, Bonnie. Yes.\nBonnie Herzog: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Gaurav Jain with Barclays.\nGaurav Jain: Hi, good morning. Two questions from me. One is just to clarify the Argentinian peso impact. So you have a $0.19 impact this year, which is linked to balance sheet revaluation. And on the slide, you are using the Argentinian peso rate, which is equal to the spot rate. So there shouldn't be any further balance sheet revaluation down, which means that there is an automatic $0.19 benefit to EPS. Isn't that the way the math works?\nJacek Olczak: Look, of course, we cannot speculate on any further devaluation of the peso. The reality is that the amount in dollar terms has been significantly reduced by the last devaluation. So a further devaluation would impact to a much lower amount. Now I don't know whether more devaluation could come. Frankly, we're not able to anticipate this kind of thing. What you have to take into account is that the basis has been -- in fact, as basically with the devaluation in December. So any further devaluation would apply to a lower base in Argentinian peso.\nGaurav Jain: Sure. Maybe I can ask it separately. And my second question is around ZYN. We are hearing a lot of statements. We had a statement by Chuck Schumer. A lot of investors are concerned, they think that regulation is coming on, then flavors will get banned. So how do you plan to get ahead of this entire potential controversy that could emerge around ZYN?\nJacek Olczak: Yes. So we observed over the last few weeks, I heard a lot of conversations around Brazil in social media and generally Internet and media. I think, look, ZYN is in the U.S. market for 10 years, okay? And if you look at the numbers, CDC latest data on the underage usage, et cetera, it stays very below. I think it's 50% which is the lowest from any product nicotine and also other products where there's some major restrictions applied. I think we know what about the Swedish Match marketing practices, and we were taking this very seriously during the acquisition of the (inaudible). We have said that the alignment with Service Match was not only that they were pursuing the smoke-free trajectory, but also that they have a very responsible and a disciplined approach to the marketing as we are on -- with IQOS, with heat-not-burn and the international. We have reached out to the few people who have been the most vocal too in these conversations with general consumer, but also to FDA and I think the facts are different than sometimes it is being -- trying to be the positions in the media. So the product is helping adult smokers with very strict with the age verifications. Obviously, when it comes to the conversations among the adults in the social media, that's going a little -- well, going anticipating, frankly speaking, in the territories we wouldn't have a control. ZYN is not using any paid ambassadors or whatever this is being called in the social media. So we think what we're doing is put the right product from the potential of the reduction of the harm where the product is based on science position and the risk reduction continuum, frankly speaking, it is the best nicotine alternative to any another nicotine product, very much obviously versus the cigarette. We have a pending PMTA with FDA and feel the science is very strong and very conclusive on the site. So I feel very confident. From the very beginning of our transformation, solid Swedish Match, we put the marketing team and very much the protection of the youth very, very high on our agenda. So I think it gives me the confidence that, as I said earlier to Bonnie's question, we have a progress, phenomenal growth on the products, which are delivered in a very sustainable manner to adult smoker.\nOperator: We'll go now to Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley.\nPamela Kaufman: Good morning. I have a question about ZYN as well. It's seen phenomenal growth in the U.S. Can you talk about what's driving the acceleration in growth in ZYN in the U.S.? And are there any particular regions where you're seeing stronger growth? And just on the ZYN guidance, it implies about 35% growth in U.S. shipments, but that seems conservative given the strength that we've seen. So is there anything that would temper ZYN's growth outlook relative to what we're observing?\nJacek Olczak: Yes. So the ZYN, as you might remember from our Investors Day, the profile of the ZYN, when it comes toward the smoke or where the adults are coming from, there is any sourcing very nicely from a combustible cigarette, obviously, serves from the overall categories, including the tobacco-containing pouches, Swedish snus or similar products, but also resourcing from the vape category. So it is being recognized by the growing number of adults, the convenience of usage of Brazil. It is -- another way of looking at ZYN, it is a natural innovation or extension of the Swedish snus product, the tobacco-containing pouches. Obviously, as we know them, some people were not maybe comfortable of having a tobacco in the pouch. There are some optical hygienic type where they may be constraints, et cetera, and ZYN is something which is -- looks cleaner and is white, it doesn't contain tobacco, which might have been for a -- might be for some consumer create some resistance. So this is what I can say. I think the product has a good trajectory. The market is a large market in the U.S. with a well-developed e-vape category, obviously, still a very sizable combustible cigarette category and also many other oral tobacco forms, so it's a nice sourcing for ZYN, which is appealing to these audiences. With regards to your comments about the number of accounts forecasted, naturally related to our guidance for next year. We are very well familiar with that slightly trend in the U.S. Can ZYN surprise us to the positive? Yes. Can -- but guidance is built on the number of the assumptions, right? I mean it's a global business, multi-category and there are some headwinds, which we are aware today. I'm not sure whether there's a lot of materialized, but I think it's a matter of prudence is that this part of the year at the beginning of the year to single them amount and be prudent, but there are also some upsides and the tailwinds, which we are well aware of. The year-end faults will come to the Q1. I mean as a player, we build the confidence as you go through the year.\nJacek Olczak: Yes. And Pam, to clarify the guidance here, we are coming with a growth year-on-year that would be similar than the one we've been experiencing in terms of total volume growth and not in a big percentage year versus '23 and '22. So these are similar volume growth. It's related to a reduction in the growth rate. We'll see whether your -- we have still going even higher than what we are forecasting for the time being.\nPamela Kaufman: Okay. Thank you. That makes sense. And a question on the patent settlement with BAT. Can you elaborate on the implications of that? I know you've been investing in manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. for IQOS. How does the settlement influence your ability to import into the U.S.? And does it change your manufacturing strategy?\nJacek Olczak: Well, it actually allows us now to also connect IQOS in the U.S. to the supply chain, which is on the international supply chain from day 1, which is operating with all the benefits of economies of scale, et cetera. So obviously, as the mitigating type of a strategy we have been implementing in parallel the alternative manufacturing in the U.S., but that obviously is the first factory, first volumes. We would obviously result in the increased or elevated cost both on the devices and the HeatSticks and it will take a while until U.S., on a stand-alone basis, would close at the same level of the benefits of the cost, if you like, as we had on international. So for us, it clears the path for IQOS, top blend and ILUMA. So we're bringing a lot of -- or removing that, I should say, uncertainty from today and going forward. And IQOS because it is U.S., it's just another market which we added to the geographical family of IQOS presence from a day one, will have an access as I said to the pipeline of the products and its economic cost benefits as an international market. So for us, actually, is clarity and acceleration which we gain through this agreement. And obviously, as we all know, the patent litigation territory has a high degree of uncertainty. And we're running a very sizable business and we plan to have even more sizable business with the addition now of U.S. and that clarity and the visibility going forward is very important which I believe is also important for investors too.\nOperator: We'll go next to Faham Baig with UBS.\nMirza Faham Ali Baig: Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Thank you for the questions. I have a couple as well, please. Firstly, you're guiding for another impressive year of mid-teens heated tobacco in-market sales growth. You've highlighted Europe will be within that range. Historically, Europe has done slightly better. What markets make up the sort of difference to help you to still get to the mid-teens growth? If you could allude to the larger markets. And within that, are you assuming any contribution from Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, you mentioned? And what should we expect for the U.S. as well, please?\nJacek Olczak: So maybe I start with the U.S. I mean the U.S., we will do the test market on IQOS three point -- what we called IQOS 3.0 blade product, which is literally for us the high cost and we keep looking forward to get more visibility from FDA with regards to the PMTA MRTPA for IQOS which would allow us to accelerate the broader, more national type of a commercialization. So what we have assumed in 2024 in terms of the volume contribution of IQOS from U.S., it's very minimal. We are not treating this as testing the engine, commercial, the consumer phasing type of a solution rather than a lowered the current version of the product at the full scope. We have assumed -- we made some assumptions with regards of opening the markets in which IQOS today is not allowed. The trade not on the list is obviously Taiwan. Okay, that's each other assumptions and we might be right or wrong, but these are the assumptions which we made. It obviously hinges on the speed of some regulatory decisions and the laws being passed and et cetera. And with regards to Europe, look, I mean although I believe and the history have shown with the flavor type of regulations in the different categories, in the different places, that over a period of time, they don't have much of an impact to the dollar. But we're going in a period that some markets or markets will be implementing these regulations. I think they need to be cautious that there might be some distortions. I mean that they put in a guidelines and these will be transparent and still give you potential with headwind, which we take in, in the volume outlook for IQOS, but we'll have to see where this materializes. Not materialize, I think it's a matter of who then we should talk about this. Other than that, the underlying IQOS growth, if I look at the value of a share evolution, essentially, our European market is pretty strong despite the fact that very much in Central Europe, there is maybe more of the pricing competition from other heat-not-burn participants. But we also have a very strong price competition, extremely strong price competition, I should say, both on the devices and the consumables, consumables in Japan. And over the period of time, IQOS navigates for this highly sometimes aggressive competitive pricing environment very well. So that's essentially where we are. Germany grows very nicely. Italy continues with a very strong growth momentum. Again, the major driver is Spain. We make the -- we start making a significant progress. So that's it for me.\nMirza Faham Ali Baig: Thank you. And then just one other question, please. So you're expecting a smoke-free acceleration in 2024, but that's not translating into group net revenue growth acceleration in 2024. Are you expecting a softer performance in combustibles in '24? Is that the discrepancy?\nJacek Olczak: Yes. I mean look, this is the blended -- at this moment in time, at the beginning of the year, the blended outlook for the group revenue is combustibles, oral and, obviously, heat-not-burn. There's few other in smaller things. But we have managed last year to deliver a very strong pricing variance. I think again, it's fair to assume that the driver of a pricing variance may not be repeatable this year. But there is obviously a pricing potential, which we baked in, in the -- or included in the guidance. Look, for some of these things, we need a little bit more visibility to start increasing our confidence. I still believe that if I compare what Philip Morris is delivering now, number of the years when we leave the revenue top line above 7%. And remember very well the times when we started transformations when they were the 3% to 5%, now I think a quality what counts for us, and this is what we pay a lot of attention, that we not only want to lead in a sustainable matter the revenue growth, but obviously important is the quality of that revenue growth. So having a 3-year total group volumes to start with above was no decline, not even flat, but growing, when you start overlaying this by pricing and managing to -- focusing to avoid the risk of some down-trading, et cetera, I think that the 7% is there, well, above 7% revenue growth is the pretty -- from a qualitative perspective, not just from the nominal growth perspective, I would think that is all that EBITDA.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Just to add to what Jacek has just been saying. I mean indeed, it's taking into account that 2023 was exceptional when it comes to price increase with close to 9% on the combustible portfolio and we don't intend to repeat that. We are guiding to a mid-single-digit price increase for 2024. So of course, that will have an impact and make a difference on the growth of our revenue on the combustible business.\nOperator: We'll go next to Callum Elliott with Bernstein.\nCallum Elliott: Hi, good morning. Thank you for the questions, guys. I just wanted to start with disposable vaping products. We've obviously seen these products have huge success in the U.S. in 2023 and the U.K. also driving us a steeper volume decline for commutable cigarettes in those markets. Obviously, your combustible cigarette business in those two markets is not huge, if nonexistent, obviously, in the U.S. So not a huge impact on your business so far. But my question is why do you think we haven't seen equivalent success for these products in the markets that are big markets for your business and the EU in particular? And do you think this could be a threat to your business in 2024?\nJacek Olczak: You mean the threat to our business coming from the e-vape products? Look, there a number of factors, right? So one is that I think that the category of the e-vape product is being disposable; it's not disposable. It's very much focused in terms of the offering and innovation, frankly speaking, into the flavors, right? Then we very often forget that the core of the smokers' market-by-market with literally few exceptions are very much and if I would characterize is a traditional tobacco type of experience flavor, et cetera. So this creates sort of a more dual consumption or occasional consumption. But I think for some smokers and we know it from our experience of IQOS, it actually triggers curiosity to try, but at the same time, triggers the bottleneck in terms of a full-time type of a switching adoption. So that's one of the factors, okay? And then obviously, other factors at play.\nCallum Elliott: I guess I understand that, yes. But why hasn't that -- it seems like in the U.S. and the U.K., that hasn't been an impediment to these products' success over the past 12, 18 months.\nJacek Olczak: Results, so the focus, right? Because U.K. was on the forefront as was U.S., if I remember historically, of the forefront of this category partially, I guess, also attracted by the underlying margins in the CC category. So obviously, people are going with alternatives to the places which create some sort of that underlying margin opportunity with the relative freedoms also to talk about these products. As you know, Europe very much, but also in international, some countries, these products are not very -- let me put it that way, warmly welcomed. So let's leave aside the hybrid action principles. But some other opinions and views at play. Look, we know that we enter a e-vape category, but we're trying to be very disciplined or focused I should say and it's very easy to enter into this category without too much of the path to sustainable profitability. And we don't want to focus the company from some other opportunities which we're pursuing, which, in our view, are more sustainable and offer the good start for the margins and the underlying profitability But when we enter with this product, Italy, Czech, a few other markets, I mean our products despite the fact that we're relatively late into the -- from a category history perspective, and then we have gained double-digit shares in this market in the speed of -- span of less than 12 months or so. So it also tells you there is a lot of lack of loyalties in place. There's a lot of yes, I know that we see the volumes, but there's a lot of trial. I should not ban category and the pouches judge by performance in the U.S. And then by definition, the consumer is more loyal, more focused, more discipline in how they navigate it also.\nCallum Elliott: Okay. And I have a follow-up that is related but maybe a slightly more philosophical question. In a number of markets and especially the U.S. related to some of these disposable vaping products, we've been seeing this formation of -- I would describe it as like a dual-tiered market that's been forming with big legacy players such as yourselves who are forced to play by the rules and hold themselves to a certain set of standards, marketing only to existing nicotine users and all of us will have seen your video on ZYN last week, I would imagine.  But at the same time, we also have a secondary set of smaller new businesses who seem to be doing basically whatever they want and often illegally, but having great success within the marketplace and attracting lots of consumers. And so I guess my question is, do you think that this dual-tiered structure that seems to be forming in a number of markets, structurally impairs the attractiveness of your business and your brands when it seems like you're just being forced to play on a playing field which is not level?\nJacek Olczak: Well, look, obviously, companies like ours is not even thinking about doing something which would be against or crossing the line of regulations or even, I would say, societal expectations. So obviously, I mean, our ability to come to you, these are -- it isn't what you're asking, grossly different than some other operators or participants in the market, especially people who don't have a view of 10 years or 15 years outlook, but it's essentially hit and run almost type of operation. And I think we know what has happened or what is happening in the U.S. There is, I understand, some discipline in the market is now underway. But frankly speaking, it's a long overdue because there is a lot of -- pardon my language, but a mess created in the market by the fact that regulators, law enforcements and other design for this designated for these agencies were a bit slow. And I think it's, frankly speaking, a replica, which we have for many years, and still in some places, kind of on a cigarette market, and it forms of an illicit type of a participation in the market. It's not only marketing practices, but also products, product standards, all of these things creates completely around distortions in the market at the expense of the legitimate category manufacturers and also diverts the conversation from how further we can progress and have reductions and divert them into the things which relatively easily should be fixed.\nCallum Elliott: Okay, thanks, Jacek.\nJacek Olczak: Thank you.\nOperator: Our final question will come from Matt Smith with Stifel.\nMatthew Smith: I think you asked second, Emmanuel, wanted to ask a follow-up question about investment levels embedded in the 2024 outlook. If we consider the expectation for gross and operating profit margin expansion on an organic basis, can you talk about the areas where you're seeing a step up meaningfully in incremental investment? Last year, you called out $150 million of explicit investments, including $75 million or so in the U.S. It would seem like the growth in ZYN would allow you to step that investment level up while still being able to achieve your double-digit profit expectations in the market.\nJacek Olczak: Yes. So a lot depends, obviously, we target adjusted the live growth above on the revenue growth. So obviously, we are assuming some improvement in the margins. But on the other hand, I think we will have enough of the resources to support that revenue growth. So it is -- if we were to completely stop investing, obviously, the expansions on a wide growth would be much more significant, margin expansions will be much more significant, but we are -- it is not what we see in our strategy. So I think once we operate it at scale and we build, like the consumer has there, so the scale in the U.S., the revenue is very substantial over there, at least by the market standard. And the revenue, which we generate from a small crew, but also combustibles on international with that sort of a revenue growth rate, I think we have a room to provide for the investments to support today's and tomorrow's growth while also allowing for driving the margin expansion. We also have provided here some inflationary pressure. And I think, especially on the combustible, I -- we assume that the 2024 is sort of the last year of this extra ordinary life of inflation under pressure. And as of 2025, in other words, we should start seeing easing when the COGS pressures, and this is about delivering some other materials. And I think every incremental IQOS and every incremental ZYN is obviously requires proportionally less of the investment with the first IQOS and the first ZYN. So, I mean, the scale offer is going forward, there's opportunity for supporting the margin.\nMatthew Smith: Thank you, Jacek.

            "content": "Thank you, James, and welcome everyone. PMI delivered another strong operating performance in 2023. We achieved our third consecutive year of positive volumes and high single-digit organic top line growth, driven by smoke-free products. Smoke-free products delivered accelerated accretion to profitability in the fourth quarter, as our IQOS business delivered meaningful 2023 operating leverage, mitigating a significant drag from combustibles. I am also very pleased to report the continued outstanding growth of ZYN, which was not included in organic metrics until mid-November. Importantly, smoke-free products reached nearly 40% of total PMI net revenues in the fourth quarter and over 40% of gross profit. For the year, smoke-free gross profit increased by 19% organically and we expect smoke-free organic growth to accelerate for both net revenues and gross profit in 2024. ZYN delivered exceptional growth in its first year within PMI with U.S. pro forma volumes up by over 60% for the year and over 75% in the quarter four. Oral smoke-free is accretive to both our smoke-free business and the overall group, with Swedish Match contributing 50 basis points organic uplift to Q4 OI margins from only 50 days of the period. Our IQOS business continues to deliver excellent results with 15% adjusted in-market sales growth for heated tobacco units reflecting broad-based momentum in Europe, Japan, and emerging markets. The rollout of IQOS ILUMA is substantially complete, now present in 51 markets representing over 95% of IQOS geographies by volume excluding Russia and Ukraine.  The superior experience and design of ILUMA combined with the strong premium brand equity of IQOS and our unrivalled commercial infrastructure enabled IQOS to outgrow the heat-not-burn category, despite holding a category share of over 75%. Importantly, as we have seen in Japan, the launch of ILUMA is a multiyear growth driver consistent with past IQOS innovations. Our 2023 combustible performance was margin dilutive despite strong commercial results, with very good pricing and higher category share. This reflects the significant cost pressures in the category, geographic mix from volume growth in lower margin markets without smoke-free products, and the impact of IQOS cannibalization. This was also compounded by the technical impact of third-party manufacturing in Indonesia and Ukraine. While cost and currency headwinds impacted our earnings in 2023, the strengthening growth and margin profile of smoke-free products set us up well to deliver sustainable growth and returns including currency in 2024 and beyond. We reached a number of key transformation milestones in Q4. First, IQOS net revenues surpassed Marlboro to become the number one international nicotine brand on this measure. This demonstrates the power of innovative smoke-free alternatives to switch adult smokers away from cigarettes, and to address the societal issue of combustible tobacco. It is also testament to our organization's ability to build strong and sustainable brand equity. This also applies to ZYN, the fastest growing U.S. smoke-free brand with another outstanding performance in Q4, marked by an increase in category volume share, retail value share, and overall volumes. We are also proud to have reached 25 markets where smoke-free products exceed 50% of our top line for both Q4 and the full year. We aim to reach 60 markets by 2030, driving our ambition to exceed two-thirds of group net revenues. Last, as I already mentioned, over 40% of our total gross profit was generated by smoke-free products with the adjusted gross margin rate on smoke-free surpassing combustibles for both the quarter and year. We are encouraged by the increasing number of governments adopting tobacco harm reduction policies to encourage reduced risk nicotine consumption instead of smoking, which is ultimately more sustainable for society. Nevertheless, a considerable amount of work remains. Sustainable growth requires a sustainable business, and we continue to garner increasing recognition for our sustainability performance across the key product and operational topics for our company. PMI was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the first time, and for the fourth year in a row DJSI North America. In addition, PMI was awarded carbon disposal projects Triple A rating for the fourth consecutive year. I will now hand it over to Emmanuel to discuss our results and outlook in more detail. Thank you, Emmanuel. Let me now take a moment to cover our key strategic priorities for 2024. First is supporting the sustained growth momentum of IQOS through continuous innovation. This includes leveraging the rollout of ILUMA to maximize user growth, while innovating further on both devices and consumables. Second is to continue the strong U.S. growth of ZYN, supported by targeted commercial investment, long-term capacity expansion and organizational infrastructure, which will also support IQOS. Outside the U.S., we intend to continue developing our integrated multi-category offering to adult nicotine users with further launches of ZYN and, where relevant, our VEEV e-vapor portfolio. Of course, 2024 will be a landmark year for IQOS in the U.S. While the ultimate launch of IQOS ILUMA is the main priority, we continue to prepare for the first city tests of the IQOS 3 blade product starting in Q2 this year. These small-scale pilot launches will allow us to experiment with different aspects of commercialization and support our drive for at-scale commercial success once ILUMA is authorized. While we have no update on the expected PMTA timeline, the patent settlement agreement announced last week allows for commercialization of both blade and induction products while mitigating risks of patent-related disruption and enables us to leverage the scale, optimized cost and flexibility of our global supply chain. In combustibles, we continue to target a stable category share over time despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization, while taking judicious pricing actions to drive a positive profit contribution. Our capital allocation priorities are crystal clear. We will continue to invest in the growth of smoke-free products, and our commitment to the dividend remains steadfast. Following the acquisition of Swedish Match, deleveraging remains our key balance sheet objective. We aim to continue our excellent progress on sustainability initiatives, including those related to product impact such as youth access prevention and post-consumer waste. Finally, and importantly, we remain committed to transforming the tobacco harm reduction landscape by providing superior alternatives to adult smokers who would otherwise continue smoking and advocating for science-based regulations. We will be expanding further on many of these topics at the CAGNY conference in two weeks' time. Let me now conclude today's presentation. Overall, our business delivered a strong 2023 performance in the face of notable cost headwinds, driven by structural smoke-free momentum. The continued excellent performance of IQOS and remarkable growth of ZYN strengthened their positions as leading brands with excellent equity. Combined with our unrivalled commercial and innovative capabilities, we have a powerful platform to expedite our smoke-free future as we broaden our portfolio and reach to adult smokers. We expect 2024 to be a year of accelerated growth for smoke-free products and remain confident in our 2024-2026 growth targets. We have exciting opportunities in the U.S. and internationally, which we are fully dedicated to capture as we progress towards our ambition of being sustainably smoke-free by 2030. Finally and importantly, our strong growth outlook and highly cash-generative business underpins our ability to deleverage while returning cash to shareholders. Thank you. And Emmanuel and I are now happy to answer your questions. So Bonnie, with regards to 2023, I think the momentum which we have in the category is in Japan, is really well worth singling out. And despite the fact that as you know IQOS occupies a very sizable part of the segment, I mean where we capture well above our segments, I think we captured about 80% of the entire segment growth in Japan. So this is very strong. Japan is on the forefront of a smoke-free transformation. We're approaching the year 10 anniversary of IQOS in Japan. And if I just look over the last few weeks how category is continuously expansions in Japan, I think in the Tokyo area, the smoke-free products now about exceeded the size of the cigarette category. So if IQOS continues after 10 years participating in this phenomenal growth, this is really worth singling out. Clearly, ZYN and as we indicated very much, we've been very keen and very pleased that we could conclude the acquisition of Swedish Match, that adds the important element of our portfolio of alternative smoking, the pouches and obviously, creates a very good opening for us in entering the U.S. market and that ZYN is clearly is growing above their expectations. What is very important is we hear from time-to-time, quite rightly, conversations about some unintended consequences about the use of the product. I am so pleased with both IQOS and with ZYN actually are delivering of as they were designed for, i.e. going after adult smokers in the U.S. above 21 years. We're all familiar with the CDC data, less than 80% youth usage, the same is for IQOS and international. So we have a good -- my view is we have a very good, sustainable growing two fabulous propositions in a smoke-free product, and we're also trying here to be very focused from a financial perspective with regards to the e-vape. So right now, if we roll this forward to 2024, I think that Japan is on the good momentum. ZYN in the U.S. continues this momentum. Europe is going very strongly very well. Yes, we have this distortion maybe potential headwinds we're getting there. We very clearly indicated the $2 billion potential impact from the flavor ban in the EU.  But other than that, these key geographies and these key geographies also are very important from the margin perspective expansion, they really are on the positive side. And I don't want to sound negative on the rest of the world. However, one thing you should note that, on occasions, there might be some conversations around the growth trajectory of IQOS and so on. And you remember during Investors Day, I've been very clear. We're running IQOS 10 consecutive years of fabulous growth despite the fact that we essentially lost any growth, access to any growth in Russia and Ukraine. And historically, I mean, Russia alone was delivering, and depends how you now -- which period you pick up, but easily above the 4 billion maybe even 5 billion per annum growth of the category. So I think we need to look at this trajectory from this perspective, which makes me even more confident about our 3-year outlook. Yes, Bonnie, Emmanuel can chip in a little more details. I think in the Americas segment, where it's more the impact of the devaluation in Argentina which drove the margins down rather than the U.S. market. Specifically about the U.S. market, yes, there is the increased investment also to continue supporting ZYN growth, and ZYN expansion, but also in preparing Swedish Match organization or Philip Morris International in the U.S. organization for being able to handle IQOS soon and obviously have the organizations, which is after the opportunities and the challenges of the U.S. market. So there are some investments which are already flowing through the P&L even ahead of the IQOS process start of the commercialization. Emmanuel, do you want to? Yes. We do absolutely, Bonnie. Yes. Look, of course, we cannot speculate on any further devaluation of the peso. The reality is that the amount in dollar terms has been significantly reduced by the last devaluation. So a further devaluation would impact to a much lower amount. Now I don't know whether more devaluation could come. Frankly, we're not able to anticipate this kind of thing. What you have to take into account is that the basis has been -- in fact, as basically with the devaluation in December. So any further devaluation would apply to a lower base in Argentinian peso. Yes. So we observed over the last few weeks, I heard a lot of conversations around Brazil in social media and generally Internet and media. I think, look, ZYN is in the U.S. market for 10 years, okay? And if you look at the numbers, CDC latest data on the underage usage, et cetera, it stays very below. I think it's 50% which is the lowest from any product nicotine and also other products where there's some major restrictions applied. I think we know what about the Swedish Match marketing practices, and we were taking this very seriously during the acquisition of the (inaudible). We have said that the alignment with Service Match was not only that they were pursuing the smoke-free trajectory, but also that they have a very responsible and a disciplined approach to the marketing as we are on -- with IQOS, with heat-not-burn and the international. We have reached out to the few people who have been the most vocal too in these conversations with general consumer, but also to FDA and I think the facts are different than sometimes it is being -- trying to be the positions in the media. So the product is helping adult smokers with very strict with the age verifications. Obviously, when it comes to the conversations among the adults in the social media, that's going a little -- well, going anticipating, frankly speaking, in the territories we wouldn't have a control. ZYN is not using any paid ambassadors or whatever this is being called in the social media. So we think what we're doing is put the right product from the potential of the reduction of the harm where the product is based on science position and the risk reduction continuum, frankly speaking, it is the best nicotine alternative to any another nicotine product, very much obviously versus the cigarette. We have a pending PMTA with FDA and feel the science is very strong and very conclusive on the site. So I feel very confident. From the very beginning of our transformation, solid Swedish Match, we put the marketing team and very much the protection of the youth very, very high on our agenda. So I think it gives me the confidence that, as I said earlier to Bonnie's question, we have a progress, phenomenal growth on the products, which are delivered in a very sustainable manner to adult smoker. Yes. So the ZYN, as you might remember from our Investors Day, the profile of the ZYN, when it comes toward the smoke or where the adults are coming from, there is any sourcing very nicely from a combustible cigarette, obviously, serves from the overall categories, including the tobacco-containing pouches, Swedish snus or similar products, but also resourcing from the vape category. So it is being recognized by the growing number of adults, the convenience of usage of Brazil. It is -- another way of looking at ZYN, it is a natural innovation or extension of the Swedish snus product, the tobacco-containing pouches. Obviously, as we know them, some people were not maybe comfortable of having a tobacco in the pouch. There are some optical hygienic type where they may be constraints, et cetera, and ZYN is something which is -- looks cleaner and is white, it doesn't contain tobacco, which might have been for a -- might be for some consumer create some resistance. So this is what I can say. I think the product has a good trajectory. The market is a large market in the U.S. with a well-developed e-vape category, obviously, still a very sizable combustible cigarette category and also many other oral tobacco forms, so it's a nice sourcing for ZYN, which is appealing to these audiences. With regards to your comments about the number of accounts forecasted, naturally related to our guidance for next year. We are very well familiar with that slightly trend in the U.S. Can ZYN surprise us to the positive? Yes. Can -- but guidance is built on the number of the assumptions, right? I mean it's a global business, multi-category and there are some headwinds, which we are aware today. I'm not sure whether there's a lot of materialized, but I think it's a matter of prudence is that this part of the year at the beginning of the year to single them amount and be prudent, but there are also some upsides and the tailwinds, which we are well aware of. The year-end faults will come to the Q1. I mean as a player, we build the confidence as you go through the year. Yes. And Pam, to clarify the guidance here, we are coming with a growth year-on-year that would be similar than the one we've been experiencing in terms of total volume growth and not in a big percentage year versus '23 and '22. So these are similar volume growth. It's related to a reduction in the growth rate. We'll see whether your -- we have still going even higher than what we are forecasting for the time being. Well, it actually allows us now to also connect IQOS in the U.S. to the supply chain, which is on the international supply chain from day 1, which is operating with all the benefits of economies of scale, et cetera. So obviously, as the mitigating type of a strategy we have been implementing in parallel the alternative manufacturing in the U.S., but that obviously is the first factory, first volumes. We would obviously result in the increased or elevated cost both on the devices and the HeatSticks and it will take a while until U.S., on a stand-alone basis, would close at the same level of the benefits of the cost, if you like, as we had on international. So for us, it clears the path for IQOS, top blend and ILUMA. So we're bringing a lot of -- or removing that, I should say, uncertainty from today and going forward. And IQOS because it is U.S., it's just another market which we added to the geographical family of IQOS presence from a day one, will have an access as I said to the pipeline of the products and its economic cost benefits as an international market. So for us, actually, is clarity and acceleration which we gain through this agreement. And obviously, as we all know, the patent litigation territory has a high degree of uncertainty. And we're running a very sizable business and we plan to have even more sizable business with the addition now of U.S. and that clarity and the visibility going forward is very important which I believe is also important for investors too. So maybe I start with the U.S. I mean the U.S., we will do the test market on IQOS three point -- what we called IQOS 3.0 blade product, which is literally for us the high cost and we keep looking forward to get more visibility from FDA with regards to the PMTA MRTPA for IQOS which would allow us to accelerate the broader, more national type of a commercialization. So what we have assumed in 2024 in terms of the volume contribution of IQOS from U.S., it's very minimal. We are not treating this as testing the engine, commercial, the consumer phasing type of a solution rather than a lowered the current version of the product at the full scope. We have assumed -- we made some assumptions with regards of opening the markets in which IQOS today is not allowed. The trade not on the list is obviously Taiwan. Okay, that's each other assumptions and we might be right or wrong, but these are the assumptions which we made. It obviously hinges on the speed of some regulatory decisions and the laws being passed and et cetera. And with regards to Europe, look, I mean although I believe and the history have shown with the flavor type of regulations in the different categories, in the different places, that over a period of time, they don't have much of an impact to the dollar. But we're going in a period that some markets or markets will be implementing these regulations. I think they need to be cautious that there might be some distortions. I mean that they put in a guidelines and these will be transparent and still give you potential with headwind, which we take in, in the volume outlook for IQOS, but we'll have to see where this materializes. Not materialize, I think it's a matter of who then we should talk about this. Other than that, the underlying IQOS growth, if I look at the value of a share evolution, essentially, our European market is pretty strong despite the fact that very much in Central Europe, there is maybe more of the pricing competition from other heat-not-burn participants. But we also have a very strong price competition, extremely strong price competition, I should say, both on the devices and the consumables, consumables in Japan. And over the period of time, IQOS navigates for this highly sometimes aggressive competitive pricing environment very well. So that's essentially where we are. Germany grows very nicely. Italy continues with a very strong growth momentum. Again, the major driver is Spain. We make the -- we start making a significant progress. So that's it for me. Yes. I mean look, this is the blended -- at this moment in time, at the beginning of the year, the blended outlook for the group revenue is combustibles, oral and, obviously, heat-not-burn. There's few other in smaller things. But we have managed last year to deliver a very strong pricing variance. I think again, it's fair to assume that the driver of a pricing variance may not be repeatable this year. But there is obviously a pricing potential, which we baked in, in the -- or included in the guidance. Look, for some of these things, we need a little bit more visibility to start increasing our confidence. I still believe that if I compare what Philip Morris is delivering now, number of the years when we leave the revenue top line above 7%. And remember very well the times when we started transformations when they were the 3% to 5%, now I think a quality what counts for us, and this is what we pay a lot of attention, that we not only want to lead in a sustainable matter the revenue growth, but obviously important is the quality of that revenue growth. So having a 3-year total group volumes to start with above was no decline, not even flat, but growing, when you start overlaying this by pricing and managing to -- focusing to avoid the risk of some down-trading, et cetera, I think that the 7% is there, well, above 7% revenue growth is the pretty -- from a qualitative perspective, not just from the nominal growth perspective, I would think that is all that EBITDA. You mean the threat to our business coming from the e-vape products? Look, there a number of factors, right? So one is that I think that the category of the e-vape product is being disposable; it's not disposable. It's very much focused in terms of the offering and innovation, frankly speaking, into the flavors, right? Then we very often forget that the core of the smokers' market-by-market with literally few exceptions are very much and if I would characterize is a traditional tobacco type of experience flavor, et cetera. So this creates sort of a more dual consumption or occasional consumption. But I think for some smokers and we know it from our experience of IQOS, it actually triggers curiosity to try, but at the same time, triggers the bottleneck in terms of a full-time type of a switching adoption. So that's one of the factors, okay? And then obviously, other factors at play. Results, so the focus, right? Because U.K. was on the forefront as was U.S., if I remember historically, of the forefront of this category partially, I guess, also attracted by the underlying margins in the CC category. So obviously, people are going with alternatives to the places which create some sort of that underlying margin opportunity with the relative freedoms also to talk about these products. As you know, Europe very much, but also in international, some countries, these products are not very -- let me put it that way, warmly welcomed. So let's leave aside the hybrid action principles. But some other opinions and views at play. Look, we know that we enter a e-vape category, but we're trying to be very disciplined or focused I should say and it's very easy to enter into this category without too much of the path to sustainable profitability. And we don't want to focus the company from some other opportunities which we're pursuing, which, in our view, are more sustainable and offer the good start for the margins and the underlying profitability But when we enter with this product, Italy, Czech, a few other markets, I mean our products despite the fact that we're relatively late into the -- from a category history perspective, and then we have gained double-digit shares in this market in the speed of -- span of less than 12 months or so. So it also tells you there is a lot of lack of loyalties in place. There's a lot of yes, I know that we see the volumes, but there's a lot of trial. I should not ban category and the pouches judge by performance in the U.S. And then by definition, the consumer is more loyal, more focused, more discipline in how they navigate it also. Well, look, obviously, companies like ours is not even thinking about doing something which would be against or crossing the line of regulations or even, I would say, societal expectations. So obviously, I mean, our ability to come to you, these are -- it isn't what you're asking, grossly different than some other operators or participants in the market, especially people who don't have a view of 10 years or 15 years outlook, but it's essentially hit and run almost type of operation. And I think we know what has happened or what is happening in the U.S. There is, I understand, some discipline in the market is now underway. But frankly speaking, it's a long overdue because there is a lot of -- pardon my language, but a mess created in the market by the fact that regulators, law enforcements and other design for this designated for these agencies were a bit slow. And I think it's, frankly speaking, a replica, which we have for many years, and still in some places, kind of on a cigarette market, and it forms of an illicit type of a participation in the market. It's not only marketing practices, but also products, product standards, all of these things creates completely around distortions in the market at the expense of the legitimate category manufacturers and also diverts the conversation from how further we can progress and have reductions and divert them into the things which relatively easily should be fixed. Thank you. Yes. So a lot depends, obviously, we target adjusted the live growth above on the revenue growth. So obviously, we are assuming some improvement in the margins. But on the other hand, I think we will have enough of the resources to support that revenue growth. So it is -- if we were to completely stop investing, obviously, the expansions on a wide growth would be much more significant, margin expansions will be much more significant, but we are -- it is not what we see in our strategy. So I think once we operate it at scale and we build, like the consumer has there, so the scale in the U.S., the revenue is very substantial over there, at least by the market standard. And the revenue, which we generate from a small crew, but also combustibles on international with that sort of a revenue growth rate, I think we have a room to provide for the investments to support today's and tomorrow's growth while also allowing for driving the margin expansion. We also have provided here some inflationary pressure. And I think, especially on the combustible, I -- we assume that the 2024 is sort of the last year of this extra ordinary life of inflation under pressure. And as of 2025, in other words, we should start seeing easing when the COGS pressures, and this is about delivering some other materials. And I think every incremental IQOS and every incremental ZYN is obviously requires proportionally less of the investment with the first IQOS and the first ZYN. So, I mean, the scale offer is going forward, there's opportunity for supporting the margin. Thank you, Matt. Thank you, all. Speak to you soon."

            "content": "Thank you, Jacek. Let's start with the headline numbers. We finished the year strongly with Q4 organic net revenue growth of 8.3%. This includes 14% growth from smoke-free products despite slower HTU shipment growth due to comparison effects, and also 5% growth from combustibles. Pricing was a strong driver for both categories, with smoke-free pricing including the impact of retail price increases on HTUs. While Swedish Match was only included in organic metrics as of November 12, it contributed 0.8 percentage points to Q4 organic top line growth and grew by an excellent 26% on a pro forma basis. Operating income grew organically by a very good 8%, including a Swedish Match contribution of 2.2 points. As expected, Q4 margins were broadly stable organically, and grew excluding the technical effects mentioned by Jacek. This enabled our business to deliver another quarter of double-digit currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth at 12.2%. This exceeded our prior expectations with ZYN's remarkable growth a notable contributor. Despite this strong currency-neutral result, Q4 adjusted diluted EPS of $1.36 was adversely affected by a greater than expected currency impact of $0.20. This includes a $0.09 balance sheet related impact under hyperinflationary accounting in Argentina, following the devaluation of the peso in mid-December. As with the previously mentioned impact in Q3, this reflects the depreciation of monetary net assets denominated in pesos, which are subject to capital controls. By its nature, this does not carry forward to future periods. Turning to the full year. Net revenues grew by plus 7.8% organically, representing the third straight year of high single-digit growth. Similar to Q4, this reflects continued excellent IQOS momentum and strong combustible pricing. In 2023, Swedish Match, led by ZYN, grew pro forma ex-currency net revenues by 20%. Operating income grew by plus 3.7% organically, reflecting a challenging first half followed by strong growth in H2. We delivered expansion in both adjusted gross margins and operating income margins in H2, driven by the strong progress of smoke-free products. With the impact of accelerated device sales from the ILUMA rollout in the base and a return to sea freight to Japan, the effects of growing HTU volumes and ongoing cost optimization are clearly visible. As expected, OI margins organically contracted 150 basis points for the full year, primarily due to acute cost and supply chain headwinds in H1. As flagged in prior quarters, full year margins include a 40 basis point headwind from the accounting treatment of third-party manufacturing in Indonesia and Ukraine, primarily reflecting the Indonesia excise tax gross up of around $250 million growth in both net revenues and cost of sales. While headwinds in combustibles have not fully abated, our smoke-free business is delivering excellent profit growth, and our organic results will include the strong contributions from Swedish Match going forward. We successfully mitigated inflationary pressures and supported investments with efficiencies. Across our total operating cost base, we delivered an incremental $100 million in gross cost efficiencies in Q4, and $2.2 billion for 2021/2023 overall, surpassing our $2 billion target. We target an additional $2 billion over the next three years. These positive factors allowed us to deliver very strong currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 11%, ahead of our prior expectations. Adjusted diluted EPS of $6.01 includes unfavorable currency of $0.63, primarily reflecting the Japanese yen, Russian ruble, and specific Argentine peso dynamics I just explained. We include a slide in the appendix to this presentation with more detail. Focusing now on volumes. We comfortably achieved a third consecutive year of shipment growth driven by a 15% increase for IQOS HTUs, in addition to a resilient combustible performance. Our smoke-free volumes made up over 20% of total PMI in Q4, and with continued mid-teens or better growth expected here, we are very well-positioned to continue growing volumes over the mid and long-term. 2023 HTU shipment volumes of 125.3 billion units were at the lower end of our targeted range due to delayed launches in Saudi Arabia and Taiwan, combined with lower-than-expected underlying growth in Russia and Ukraine. For IQOS HTUs, we believe the best indicator of underlying growth is adjusted IMS, as the closest metric to consumer offtake. For the full year, adjusted in-market volumes and shipment growth were in line at plus 15%. In the fourth quarter, HTU shipment growth of 6% reflects trade inventory build-up in the prior year quarter and the plus 14% adjusted IMS growth is therefore a more reliable measure of continued strong growth momentum. Excluding Russia and Ukraine, adjusted in-market sales grew by more than plus 17% for the year. For context, across the two years before the war began in 2022 these markets made up 23% of HTU shipment volumes and exceeded the company's growth rate by a notable margin. These smoke-free volume growth rates exclude the excellent development of our oral nicotine portfolio driven by ZYN, with shipment volumes up by plus 23% in Q4 and plus 17% in 2023 on a pro forma basis. Cigarette shipments declined by a modest 1.4% in 2023, outperforming the international category decline of 2.4%. Turning to profits. Organic operating income growth stepped up in H2 to plus 10% following the exceptional headwinds of H1. We believe this is more representative of the underlying momentum of our business, and in line with our 2024/2026 CAGR target range of plus 8% to 10%. Focusing now on some key drivers of our full year operating income, smoke-free gross profit grew organically by an excellent plus 19%, expanding gross margins by 340 basis points. This reflects part of the operating leverage of IQOS I already mentioned, with a notable contribution from Swedish Match oral nicotine in the last 50 days of Q4 with organic operating profit growth of over 50%. With smoke-free commercial costs also increasing by less than net revenues, this clearly bodes well for 2024 as we continue to benefit from scale effects and manufacturing optimization. Despite very strong pricing there was only marginal organic growth in combustible gross profits. This partly reflects the negative geographic mix I already mentioned, with greater volume declines in higher margin markets like Japan as adult smokers switch to smoke-free products, and better volume trends in lower margin geographies where smoke-free products are small or not available such as Turkey. There were also significant inflationary pressures on leaf, direct materials and other manufacturing costs. Cost increases on leaf, where inventories cover multiple crop years, and wages are likely to carry over into 2024, and should ease thereafter. Moving now to Swedish Match, which delivered outstanding performance in its first full year as part of PMI, with adjusted pro forma currency neutral top line growth of 26% in Q4 and 20% in 2023. When we announced our offer for Swedish Match in 2022, we targeted a return on investment in excess of our cost of capital within five years. With the growth of ZYN surpassing our expectations, we now expect to achieve this well ahead of time. ZYN delivered another remarkable U.S. performance with plus 78% volume growth in Q4 and 62% in 2023. Internationally, we have launched or relaunched ZYN in 10 markets as planned, as we continue to focus on building a truly global brand. U.S. cigars posted robust 2023 results, growing net revenues and profits. This was driven by strong pricing following an increase in April, partially offset by volume declines which reflect lagged competitor pricing and comparison effects. ZYN's excellent U.S progress continued in Q4 with 15% sequential growth in 12-month rolling shipments. Impressively, category volume share grew for the third consecutive quarter to 72.8%, an increase of plus 5.4 points year-on-year and plus 2 points sequentially. Retail value share also grew during the quarter to 77.4%, highlighting ZYN's premium positioning and superior brand equity. This accelerated growth again reflects a broad step-up in nationwide store velocities and gradual distribution expansion as the category gains strong traction with adult nicotine users for its convenience and pleasurable experience. Now focusing on IQOS, starting with user growth. We estimate there were 28.6 million IQOS users as of December 31st, representing growth of 1.2 million users in the quarter and 3.7 million for the full year, a nice acceleration compared to 2022. This includes notable progress in Japan and Europe, in addition to a broad range of other geographies. ILUMA is now available in essentially all major markets outside Russia and Ukraine, with over 17 million estimated adult users as of December 31, 2023. This reflects the switching of existing IQOS users and the acquisition of adult smokers. We expect ILUMA to drive continued strong IQOS user growth in 2024 and beyond. Considering the seasonal fluctuations and volatility in quarterly user estimation, we plan to report this metric on a semi-annual basis going forward. With the addition of ZYN to our portfolio, and a smaller, but growing VEEV e-vapor business, we also intend to provide a more holistic view of our total smoke-free user base to investors. Moving now to IQOS in the Europe region, where smoke-free products made up more than 45% of Q4 net revenues. Our Q4 adjusted HTU share increased by plus 1.2 points to 9.6% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume. A key driver is the growing uptake of ILUMA, which is available to around 90% of IQOS users in the region after eight further launches during the quarter. In the EU, 11 markets making up nearly 30% of regional IQOS volumes adopted the delegated directive to implement a characterizing flavor ban on heated tobacco products and implemented clean-shelf policies in October. While still early days, we estimate only a small impact on offtake as consumers adjust, as well as on trade inventory levels. Indeed, adjusted IMS volumes continue to exhibit very good sequential growth and reached a record high 12.4 billion units on a four-quarter moving average. This reflects double-digit year-on-year progression of plus 13% in Q4, despite the lack of growth in Ukraine. We expect the remaining EU markets to adopt the characterizing flavor ban in 2024 and estimate a full year consumer adjustment impact of around 2 billion units on both shipment and IMS, representing less than 5% of regional volumes and less than 2% of total PMI. This is consistent with other past flavor restrictions, such as the EU ban applied to combustibles in 2020. Based on the initial data from markets that have enacted the ban, our fundamental view remains the same. We do not expect a meaningful change in the structural trajectory of the category, and indeed expect Europe adjusted IMS progression to be broadly in line with the group growth rate in 2024. Europe is also an important geography for innovation. LEVIA zero-tobacco HTUs were launched in the Czech Republic in mid-October through limited channels with an encouraging initial response. We plan a broader Czech rollout later this month and further market launches this year. In Japan, the heat-not-burn category now represents close to 40% of the total industry, with IQOS driving its growth and reaching over 8.5 million adult users. In Q4, the adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by 3.1 points to 27.6% with off-take share surpassing 34% in Tokyo. Adjusted IMS volumes increased by 14.5% year-over-year for 2023 and 13.4% in Q4 alone, reaching a record high of almost 10 billion units on a four-quarter moving average. Such impressive growth in a market with already high category penetration is a clear testament to the sustainable potential of IQOS around the world. HTU shipment volumes returned to a more normalized state in the fourth quarter as compared to a tough prior year inventory comparison, following the substantial completion of the transition back to sea freight in Q3. In addition to strong IQOS share gains in developed countries, we continue to see very promising growth in low and middle income markets. This slide highlights a selection of Q4 key city off-take shares across markets in Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Egypt continues to impress with Cairo off-take share up plus 3 points to 9.4%, also noting encouraging results elsewhere in the region such as Morocco and Lebanon. Indonesia also saw notable progress in its capital city, especially given limited commercialization. We continue to see dynamic off-take volume growth across these important future markets, with the city shares towards the right of this chart an indication of the exciting potential. While we have already covered the margin dynamics on combustibles, our 2023 commercial performance was very robust with organic top line growth of plus 5.5%. This reflects both strong pricing, with notable contributions from Germany and Indonesia, and positive share performance within a resilient international category. Our cigarette category share grew by plus 0.1 points in Q4 and plus 0.2 points in 2023 with notable contributions from Egypt, Poland, and Turkey. Although flattered by competitor supply constraints in Egypt, which may normalize in 2024, we again achieved our ongoing objective of stable category share excluding this effect, despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization. This remains key as our leadership in combustibles helps to maximize switching to smoke-free products. This combustible share performance combined with the structural growth of IQOS led to an increase of plus 0.6 points of international cigarette and HTU share for the full year. As mentioned previously, our superior share of smoke-free products gives us a formidable platform for sustainable share gains, with superior unit economics. Before we turn to the 2024 outlook, let me briefly reflect on our strong delivery over the past three years, in spite of a number of substantial headwinds. The performance was clearly positive compared to our currency neutral 2021/2023 targets of more than 5% organic top line and more than 9% bottom line growth, supported by overall growing volumes. For the next three years we target a similar strong volume delivery, a plus 6% to 8% organic net revenue CAGR, and a step-up in organic operating income growth to plus 8% to 10%. We target an adjusted EPS CAGR of plus 9% to 11% ex-currency growth at constant 2023 corporate tax rates, including an increase in net financing costs which skews towards the first year of the period in 2024. Okay. This brings me to the outlook for 2024, where we expect a strong acceleration in smoke-free performance across IQOS volumes, smoke-free net revenues and gross profit. We forecast the highest ever absolute increase in HTU adjusted IMS volumes to deliver plus 14% to plus 16% growth in percentage terms, despite the inclusion of an estimated impact of around 2 billion units from consumer adjustment to the EU characterizing flavor ban I mentioned earlier, and essentially no off-take growth in Russia. For shipment volumes, we target more than 140 billion units, subject to the usual inherent volatility of shipment timing, new market launches and potential supply chain disruptions, such as the ongoing situation in the Red Sea. While shipment growth rates naturally follow adjusted IMS over time, there is a possibility of some lower inventory levels compared to 2023 given the substantial completion of ILUMA launches and opportunities for working capital optimization. We expect continued excellent U.S. ZYN volume growth to around 520 million cans. We have also accelerated our capacity expansion plans to support this further significant step-up in volumes and to manage inventory levels, which are naturally affected by the recent level of growth. Such a strong outlook for IQOS and ZYN means we expect to deliver an acceleration in organic smoke-free top line growth compared to 2023, reaching close to $15 billion in net revenues at prevailing exchange rates. This supports a total PMI forecast of plus 6.5% to plus 8% organic net revenue progression, including a fourth consecutive year of total volume growth and mid-single digit combustible pricing. We also forecast an acceleration in smoke-free gross profit growth from the organic plus 19% delivered in 2023 as IQOS profitability expands and ZYN's excellent economics continue. We expect smoke-free to again drive the lion's share of our forecast organic OI growth of plus 8% to plus 9.5%, notably given the enduring cost pressures and negative geographic mix in combustibles I just mentioned. This naturally implies organic margin expansion, even factoring in the ongoing technical dilution impact of third-party manufacturing in Indonesia. We expect a meaningful organic improvement in overall gross margins excluding technical impacts, and a very limited currency impact on adjusted OI margins. This forecast includes notable capability investments in the U.S., but as mentioned at Investor Day we still expect to deliver strong double-digit operating income growth in this market. As flagged at last year's Investor Day, we anticipate an increased net financing expense this year as debt is renewed at higher rates. We forecast a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, as compared to $1.1 billion in 2023. We also assume a higher effective corporate tax rate due to Russia's suspension of certain double tax treaties and earnings mix. These tax and interest factors combined impact our currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth projection by around 2 percentage points. Accordingly, we forecast currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 7% to plus 9%. This translates into an adjusted diluted EPS range of $6.32 to $6.44, including an unfavorable currency impact of $0.11 at prevailing rates. This notably includes a net favorable impact of $0.13 related to the revaluation of monetary balances in hyperinflationary economies in 2023, skewed to the second half comparison. Moving to the shape of expected 2024 performance on a quarterly basis, we anticipate good double-digit growth in adjusted IMS HTU growth every quarter supporting the full year forecast of plus 14% to plus 16%. We forecast a strong Q1 overall with HTU shipment volumes of 31 billion to 32 billion and continued strong volume growth from ZYN. We expect organic top line and operating income growth to be broadly consistent with the full year outlook, which implies organic margin expansion as with the full year. We project strong Q1 currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 7% to plus 10%. This translates to a range of $1.37 to $1.42, including a negative currency variance of $0.10 at prevailing rates, with currency comparisons improving in the second half as we lap the Argentina impacts of 2023. Our business remains highly cash generative. However, the $9.2 billion in 2023 operating cash flow was lower than expected. This was due to currency effects on net earnings including the Argentine peso devaluation, other year-end currency impacts and higher-than-expected working capital needs. In 2024, we target between $10 billion and $11 billion in operating cash flow at prevailing exchange rates and subject to working capital requirements. We continue to prioritize investing in innovation and the growth of our smoke-free portfolio. In 2024, we expect capital expenditures of around $1.2 billion including the ZYN capacity expansion I just mentioned. Deleveraging remains a key priority for us, and as expected our 2023 net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was around three times given the 2023 purchase of the remaining Swedish Match minorities and the final U.S. IQOS payment to Altria. We target much better progress of 0.3 to 0.5 times deleverage in 2024, driven by continued EBITDA growth and strong cash flow generation. We continue to target a ratio of around two times by the end of 2026, with buybacks to be considered once confirmed we are on track. Finally, our commitment to our progressive dividend policy is unwavering and in line with our long-term commitment to return cash to shareholders. I'll now turn it back to Jacek for concluding remarks. Yes, just to complement -- to answer your question, Bonnie, and complement what Jacek was saying on what is behind the higher-than-expected performance for '23. Clearly, as I described, a very strong dynamic on the volume on the commercial dimension, if you want. But we've been very pleased as well with the development of our margin on our smoke-free product. And we are today seeing the margin both on IQOS and on ZYN being above the average margin on CC. We are making progress on the profitability of the IQOS product and we have some price increase in Q4 overall. So that was the planned dynamic, but it is happening maybe even a bit better than what we're expecting, and we expect that to continue in Q4. And in that perspective, I mean, clearly, the U.S. is a fantastic market. We've described the fact that the margin of ZYN in the U.S. is best-in-class among our portfolio of products. And therefore, make no mistake, even if indeed, we're going to continue to invest in the U.S., the U.S. is going to be super nicely accretive in all parameters of our P&L at the level of the, of course, revenue growth but also at the level of the margin evolution and at the level of the operating income. And we reflect the fact that we talk about double-digit growth and very strong double-digit growth. U.S. is a very powerful contributor to our financial performance. Just to add to what Jacek has just been saying. I mean indeed, it's taking into account that 2023 was exceptional when it comes to price increase with close to 9% on the combustible portfolio and we don't intend to repeat that. We are guiding to a mid-single-digit price increase for 2024. So of course, that will have an impact and make a difference on the growth of our revenue on the combustible business. Thank you."

It is now my pleasure to introduce Emmanuel Babeau, our Chief Financial Officer. Over to you, Emmanuel.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, James, and welcome, everyone. We delivered very strong and better than expected performance in Q3, driven by IQOS and ZYN. Adjusted Diluted EPS grew by an excellent plus 20% in currency neutral terms to reach a record quarterly high of $1.67, despite a significant adverse currency impact in the period. Once again, our total volumes were positive, with the Q3 progression of over plus 2% positioning us to deliver our third straight year of growth. While not yet in our organic metrics, ZYN continued its exceptional growth with US volumes up by plus 66% in Q3 and over plus 50% year-to-date with a substantial increase in category share. Importantly, our IQOS business delivered another strong quarter with HTU shipment growing plus 18%, in line with the year-to-day trend. As covered at our recent Investor Day, HTU volumes have excellent unique economics relative to cigarettes, and the plus 16.5% organic net revenue growth from smoke-free product was a key driver in both our high single digit organic top line and double digit organic operating income growth. Smoke-free products made up over 36% of total net revenue in the quarter as we drive toward our new ambition of over two-thirds by 2030, making us substantially smoke-free. In combustibles, we delivered very robust performance with plus 6% growth in organic net revenues, strong pricing and higher category share despite the impact of adult smokers moving to smoke-free product. Our impressive operating income growth drove organic year-on-year margin expansion and a sequential improvement compared to the second quarter. This includes [healthy] (ph) expansion in the gross margin of our IQOS business, which surpassed combustible in the period and lower than expected commercial costs. Overall, we are pleased to report another strong quarter and we look forward with confidence to the remainder of the year and beyond. Turning now to the headline numbers. We surpassed $9 billion in quarterly net revenues for the first time as strong positive volume and continued excellent IQOS momentum supported organic net revenue growth of plus 9.3%. This organic growth does not include the impressive plus 22% adjusted ex-currency top line growth of Swedish Match led by ZYN. Our organic net revenue per unit grew by plus 7%, driven by the increasing proportion of IQOS HTUs in our sales mix and very firm combustible pricing of plus 9%. This positive top line and mixed performance drove very strong organic operating income growth of plus 11.3% and organic margin expansion of plus 70 basis points. Again, this excludes the exceptional performance of Swedish Match, which is included in our adjusted diluted EPS. We delivered adjusted diluted earning per share growth of plus 20.3% excluding an unfavorable currency impact of $0.17 notably due to the Russian ruble and the balance sheet related currency impact in Argentina, as disclosed at our recent Investor Day. Sequentially, lower net financing costs were broadly offset by a higher tax rate. Our excellent third quarter combined with the robust H1 resulted in strong delivery year-to-date. I want to highlight our volume growth of plus 1.5% and organic net revenue growth of plus 7.7%, again, reflecting continued dynamic IQOS performance and combustible pricing. In addition, Swedish Match currency neutral net revenues increased by plus 18%, excluding accounting reclassifications. Year-to-date, operating income grew by plus 2.4 organically, despite accentuated margin headwinds and notable OI decline in the first quarter due to the headwinds covered previously, which are now starting to subside. Combined with outstanding ZYN performance, this resulted in year-to-date currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 10.7% to $4.65. This is an excellent performance. Turning now to the full year outlook. I am pleased to share that following this very strong year-to-date delivery, we are raising our volume, organic sales growth and currency neutral adjusted bottom line growth forecast. First to volumes, where we increase our outlook to plus 1%, to plus 1.5% total shipment growth for cigarettes and HTUs, despite a lower expectation for the total industry. Within this, we expect to deliver HTU shipment volume within the lower half of our prior 125 billion to 130 billion range. While IQOS fundamentals remain strong, this narrowing reflects a further delay to the expected market launch in Taiwan, limited underlying growth in Russia and Ukraine, as well as some uncertainty related to inventory level in the EU as trade partner adjusts to the upcoming HTU flavor ban. For combustible, the resilience of our portfolio is reflected in an updated forecast of a 1% to 2% cigarette volume decline. ZYN continues to perform exceptionally with strong adult consumer traction. Following a further step up in the US volume run rate, we are now increasing our full year nicotine pouch forecast range to 390 million to 410 million cans. Combining the improved volume outlook with robust pricing and continued positive mix, we are narrowing our organic net revenue growth forecast to around plus 8%, the midpoint of our previous range. As I will come back to shortly, we expect excellent organic OI growth over the second half of the year. Combining this strong profit performance with the continuation of ZYN\u2019s phenomenal growth and diligent cost management allows us to raise our currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth forecast to plus 10% to plus 10.5%. This means we now expect double digit growth for the third year running and translate into a full-year range of $6.05 to $6.08, including an estimated unfavorable currency impact of $0.53 at prevailing rates. Last, despite increased currency headwinds, we continue to expect operating cash flow of around $10 billion for the year. This sets us up nicely as we focus on deleveraging towards our target of around 2 times adjusted net debt to EBITDA in 2026. Now, let me provide a different view of our forecasted results. As you can see, 2023 has very much been a year of two halves with a number of accentuated headwinds in H1, as explained in prior quarters, including steep cost inflation. H2 is a different story, and we believe it is more reflective of the underlying trajectory of our business. First, we expect an accelerated H2 top line with organic growth of around plus 9%. Second, we expect a significant re-acceleration in profit growth. We continue to expect organic operating income margin expansion in H2, and we are well on track after delivering another quarter of sequential adjusted OI margin improvement in Q3, with margins also expanding organically year-on-year. In H2, we expect strong organic operating income growth of around 10%. For the full-year, our expectation remains that organic margin evolution will be towards the lower-end of our minus 50 basis point to minus 150 basis point range, including the expected technical margin impact of around 40 basis points from third-party arrangement in Indonesia and Ukraine. For Q4, we expect strong operating income growth with broadly stable year-on-year organic margin provision. This includes the expectation of higher device sales as we accelerate our ILUMA rollout to reach around 50 markets by year end, complemented by further ILUMA device innovation. This very positive organic OI trajectory in H2 naturally translate into an acceleration in currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth posted by Swedish Match. Now turning back to our results, our total shipment volume increased by plus 2.2% for Q3 and plus 1.5% year-to-date, putting us comfortably on track to deliver our third sequential year of growth. HTU shipment volumes grew by plus 18% in Q3 to reach 32.5 billion units, driven by continued strong performance in Europe and Japan. Adjusting for inventory movement, including the transition back to sea freight, Q3 adjusted IMS grew by plus 14.4%. This includes Europe at plus 16% despite heightened competitive activity, notably in Poland. And a more normalized growth rate in Japan of plus 12%. Excluding Russia and Ukraine where growth remains limited, our adjusted IMS advanced by a very robust plus 16%. These growth rates exclude the excellent development of oral nicotine for which shipment volume grew by plus 19% in Q3 and plus 14% year-to-date on a pro-forma basis, including the US growth of ZYN of plus 66% and plus 56%, respectively. If we were to add the growth of nicotine pouches on a unit basis, our Q3 proforma smoke-free volume grew by plus 19.5% and our total volumes by plus 2.5%. Cigarette volumes declined by a modest 0.5% in Q3 with strong performance in Turkey and Egypt and by 1.3% year-to-date, reflecting solid category share performance in a resilient category, despite robust pricing. I will now walk through the mechanics of our Q3 net revenues. In addition to plus 2.2% volume growth, pricing contributed plus 6.2 points of growth as combustibles remain strong and the negative impact on HTU pricing of the annualization of excise tax increases in Japan and Germany, notably moderated. The increasing proportion of HTUs in our business continues to be a consistent top-line driver, reflecting higher net revenue per unit. The positive mix impact of HTU's overall volume growth and pricing are powerful drivers of our transformation and growth. We expect ZYN to enhance this further as it starts to be included in our organic metrics from mid-Q4. Looking now at adjusted operating income, where the $3.7 billion delivered in Q3 is also a record-high. I am pleased to report that following peak margin headwind in Q1, our organic growth has accelerated nicely as inflation, supply-chain disruption and ILUMA related factors continue to moderate. And the underlying dynamics of our transformation bear fruits. The Q3 progression is slightly above our 2024, 2026 CAGR target of plus 8% to plus 10% organic operating income growth. And as I covered earlier, we expect our overall H2 OI growth to be around the top of this range. This strong operating income growth in excess of an already healthy topline performance drove a better-than-expected organic margin expansion of plus 70 basis-points in the quarter. This was also the first-quarter this year, where gross margin expanded organically, notably, due to lower shipping costs, ILUMA margin improvement and lower device sales compared to the prior year. SG&A cost were also organically lower as a percentage of net revenue reflecting a good cost performance and some phasing between the third and fourth quarter. We delivered a further $120 million in gross cost efficiencies in Q3, now surpassing our $2 billion target for 2021-2023. We aim to continue this run rate, as reflected in our 2024-2026 target of an incremental $2 billion in gross savings. The Q3 margin currency variance include a 0.6 points impact from the Argentina balance sheet related item I mentioned earlier. By its nature, this does not carry-forward to future periods. Now moving to Swedish Match which is meaningfully accelerating our smoke-free growth trajectory as we progress towards becoming substantially smoke-free by 2030. Swedish Match business delivered excellent adjusted currency-neutral net revenue growth of plus 22% in Q3 and plus 18% year-to-date. This means that our adjusted pro forma year-to-date topline growth was 60 basis points higher at plus 8.3%. Swedish Match strong profitability also enhanced our year-to-date adjusted operating income margin by plus 70 basis-points. As we covered at Investor Day, Swedish Match smoke-free portfolio has excellent economic and is already at significant size compared to total PMI with its product contribution or operating profit before G&A to be clear, approaching one quarter of our total smoke-free business year-to-date. ZYN remains the key performance driver as it delivered another remarkable US performance with plus 66% volume growth, reflecting positive momentum across the country. Elsewhere in smoke-free recent trends of share gain in US moist snuff, as well as category mix headwinds in Scandinavia broadly continued. We continue to be very pleased with the positive impact of Swedish Match on our company and I would like to thank the team for delivering such a great performance. Now, let's examine ZYN's recent US performance in more detail. Exceptional progress continued in Q3 with an increase in 12 months rolling shipment volume growth of plus 62% compared to Q3 2022 and plus 14% sequentially. Impressively, ZYN Q3 category volume share grew to 70.8%, which is plus 4.7 points higher year-on year and plus 2.4 point -- 2.5 point sequentially. Retail value share remained strong at around 76%, highlighting ZYN's premium positioning and superior brand equity. This accelerated growth reflect progressive increase in distribution and a further broad step up in nationwide store velocity as the category gains strong traction with adult nicotine users for its convenience and pleasurable experience. Now focusing on IQOS starting with user groups. We estimate there were 27.4 million IQOS users as of September 30th, this represent an increase of 3.7 million user versus one year-ago and 0.2 million compared to Q2 2023. As shown on the right-hand side of the slide, the third-quarter of each year typically experiences slower user growth due to the seasonal influences in the calculation. Both new user registration and devices to legal age smokers continue to advance strongly and at levels broadly in line with Q2 when users grew by 1.4 million sequentially. Also, as in prior years, we expect a substantial acceleration in user growth in the fourth quarter. Moving now to IQOS in the Europe region, where our third quarter HTU share increased by plus 1.3 points to 8.6% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume. Continued share gains include the growing take-up of ILUMA, which is available to over 80% of IQOS users in the region. In addition to Q3 launches in Denmark and the UK, ILUMA was launched in Poland, which, like Japan, is a market with high competitive activity. We look forward to driving its performance here over the coming quarters. While sequential share is, as usual, optically affected by the seasonality of the cigarette category, adjusted IMS volumes continue to exhibit robust sequential growth and reached a record high on the four quarter moving average. This reflects strong year-on-year growth of plus 16% in Q3, despite limited growth in Ukraine. We expect strong IMS volume growth to continue in Q4, with a corresponding increase in market share. In the EU, the majority of member states have transposed a delegated directive withdrawing the heated tobacco product exemption from the characterizing flavor ban international law. The ban in this market will be effective as of October 23rd and the remaining markets are expected to adopt in 2024. As previously mentioned, we are adjusting our HTU portfolio as required in line with this transposition, and while short-term volatility is possible, including in year-end trend inventories. We do not expect significant change in the structural growth of the category. In Japan, IQOS ILUMA celebrated its second anniversary of the national launch in September and continues to exhibit strong growth due to excellent conversion, consumer satisfaction, and retention rates. Adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by plus 3 points in Q3 year-over-year to 26.6%. Importantly, adjusted in market sales volume again grew sequentially on the four-quarter moving average, reaching over 10 billion units for the first time in Q3 2023, as IQOA outgrew the heat-not-burn category. In addition to this excellent consumer trend, our Q3 shipment to Japan also benefited from further switching back to sea freight during the quarter. This shift is now substantially progressed and we expect a more normalized rate of HTU shipment in Q4. Our premium-priced TEREA HTUs and mainstream priced SENTIA HTUs continued to grow individually and in aggregate, reaching Q3 offtake shares of around 18% and 8%, respectively, despite the impact of seasonality. Our Japan city shares also continue to progress with a number reaching over 30%. We continue to see a long runway of growth in Japan over the coming quarters. In addition to strong IQOS gains in developed countries, we continue to see very promising growth in low and middle income markets. This slide highlights a selection of Q3 key cities offtake share across markets in Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. We see notable ongoing success in Egypt with Cairo offtake share of plus 3.5 points to almost 9%. And in Santo Domingo our leading Latin America city, with offtake share around 8%. Most promising is a 3.1% offtake share in [Urban] (ph) Jakarta, where IQOS is only available via the IQOS Club Members program. We continue to see robust offtake volume growth across this important future market, despite seasonal effect on sequential share metrics. I'd like to spend a moment now on combustibles, where our portfolio delivered strong organic net revenue growth of plus 6.2% in Q3 and plus 5.6% year-to-date. This reflect another strong quarter of pricing with notable contribution from Germany and Indonesia. With better-than-expected pricing in Q3 of plus 9% and plus 8.6% year-to-date, we now forecast a full-year increase of plus 8% to plus 8.5%. Our cigarette category share grew by plus 0.6 point in Q3 and plus 0.3 points year-to-date. This reflects notable contribution from Egypt, Poland and Turkey, resulting in only modest volume decline. Our leadership in combustibles helps to maximize switching to smoke-free product and we have fully achieved our ongoing objective of stable category share over the last two years, despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization. This combustible share performance combined with the structural growth of IQOS supports robust overall market-share gains. We captured plus 0.9 point of international cigarette and HTU share in Q3. And plus 0.7 points year-to-date. As covered at Investor Day, our superior share of smoke-free product give us a formidable platform for sustainable market-share gains with superior unique economics. Now let me update you briefly on our exciting innovation and expansion activities, which will be critical as we aim to reach over two-third smoke-free net revenue by 2030, including 60 markets over 50% and 40 markets of over 75%. As we covered at Investor Day, the global rollout of IQOS ILUMA continues. We launched ILUMA in four markets in Q3 reaching 27 markets in total, which represent around 75% of our IQOS business by volume. ILUMA continues to generate excellent growth with upgrades from existing user and new user acquisition. With a further six market launch already this month, we expect ILUMA to be present in around 50 market by year-end and to essentially complete the rollout next year. As also mentioned during Investor Day, superior tobacco taste is critical to our ongoing success, and we are further exploring complex and new test spaces to enhance our tobacco flavor experience. On the other end of the consumer preference spectrum, we will be offering zero tobacco consumable for non-tobacco flavored discovery under the LEVIA brand. Just as nicotine pouches are an evolution from snus to make the oral category relevant to more adult smokers, LEVIA is a similar non tobacco evolution for IQOS, as we broaden our offering to increase switching away from combustibles. The US represents the most significant opportunity to drive accelerated smoke-free growth at both the top and bottom line. We are continuing to invest behind ZYN and readying our organizational and commercial capabilities for the launch of IQOS in Q2 2024 and a scaled-up rollout with ILUMA once authorized. We remain on track to file for IQOS ILUMA's PMTA and MRTPA this months. The international expansion of nicotine pouches remain a key mid to long-term focus, notably for ZYN as the world's leading brand. During the third-quarter, we relaunched ZYN in Switzerland and following positive regulatory developments rolled out ZYN in Finland. Moving now to sustainability. Addressing the product health impact of combustible product by switching adult smoker to smoke-free product, which are designed and marketed for adult-use remains our most critical priority. This transformation is at the core of our strategy as we become a more sustainable business with accelerated growth and returns over time. With regard to tackling climate change, I am delighted to report that the Science Based Target initiative validated our forest land and agriculture emission reduction target, a recognition achieved by very few companies. We pledge to reduce this absolute Scope 3 emission by 33% by 2030, which is significant given that Scope 3 remain the most challenging aspect of any company decarbonization strategy. In September, almost 20,000 employees in over 60 countries participated in World Cleanup Day, showcasing our commitment to raising awareness around littering as part of our wider strategy to reduce post-consumer waste. We have long expressed our support for more rigor in sustainability related reporting and welcome recent moves towards greater consistency in standard under strong governance framework. As part of our ongoing work, we provided responses to consultation request from the International Sustainability Standard Board to have shared the development of their work plan, an update to the [SASB] standards. PMI continues to be recognized by [indiscernible] such as the World Business Council for Sustainable Development as the leader in non-financial reporting. We have much more to share on our sustainability effort and transformation. [indiscernible] will be presenting at the CECP CEO Investor Forum in New York on November 14th, and the event is open to all those who would like to attend. To conclude today's presentation, we continue to deliver sustainable growth through our transformation. The powerful trajectory of our smoke-free business give us confidence in strong full-year results, built on volume growth, positive mix, pricing and cost management. Considering the headwinds faced, notably in the first part of the year. We believe this speaks strongly to the fundamentals of our growth model. Notably, the outstanding performance of IQOS and ZYN continues, further enhancing our position as the global smoke-free champion. We have exciting plans to accelerate our smoke-free future in both the US. The largest smoke-free market and internationally. We are confident in our 2024-2026 CAGR target of plus 6% to plus 8% organic topline growth, plus 8% to plus 10% organic operating income growth and plus 9% to plus 11% currency-neutral adjusted EPS growth. We also as a clear guiding objective with our new ambition to be substantially smoke-free by net revenue in 2030 as another key milestone on our journey toward the smoke-free future. And finally with our latest dividend raise in September, we have delivered 16 years of continuous dividend increase since our 2008 spin, despite the ups and downs of economic and currency cycle. This translate to cumulative 183% increase and CAGR of 77.2% since 2008 with an annualized dividend of $5.20. As these demonstrate our commitment to shareholder return through a progressive dividend remain steadfast. Thank you very much. And we are now extremely happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Vivien Azer with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nVivien Azer: Hi, good morning.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Good morning, Vivien.\nVivien Azer: So I'd like to start with ZYN, please. Clearly, a very impressive result with continued acceleration in the top line. Emmanuel, you talked about distribution gains. So, I was hoping you could just level set how much more runway do you see from a distribution standpoint? Certainly, this remains a velocity-driven story, I would think. So that would be question one. And then the follow-up will just be on the margins, which came in way ahead of expectations. You've called out very strong cost management. That's clearly apparent. I'd love to hear your perspective on the durability of the current margin level for ZYN, please. Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Vivien. So on ZYN and of course, every quarter will bring its new, I would say, load of news. And I think we see in Q3 another great quarter of acceleration in the velocity that means that where the brand is already even nicely present, we see the consumer offtake accelerating. It just show that this product are becoming more relevant for a growing number of adult user and that's a great news. There is also the geographical dimension on which we elaborated at the time of our Investor Day and which is showing that, while the brand has a certain level of presence on the western part of the U.S., it doesn't mean that it isn't going to grow it further, but it's, of course, bigger than the rest of the country. There seems to be a trajectory that is saying that the rest of the country is going to adopt it progressively, and that is indeed giving also a nice, I would say, trajectory on further growth in the coming quarters and years, of course. We talk here about probably years of very nice growth. So it's great that we have beyond ZYN, two engine, which is really where the brand is already with the biggest presence. We don't see any decrease in the consumer adoption, and we see increase, what we call the velocity. And we see progressively, I think, as well quarter-after-quarter, this geographical momentum building up as expected. Now on the margin, yes, it's true that this growth of ZYN is extremely positive when it comes to margin. Of course, we are going to continue to invest behind this growth potential in the U.S., and we will put the necessary commercial resources to make sure that we maximize the growth potential. But I said it, ZYN is really best-in-class in terms of gross margin for our product in -- at the group level. I'm talking about ZYN in the U.S., but globally in [indiscernible] nice margin, but ZYN in the U.S. is best in class. And that means, of course, that growing ZYN is an excellent news for top line, but also for bottom line. And I think that in the growth of the adjusted earnings per share over the quarter, this is absolutely visible.\nVivien Azer: Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: Thank you. Good morning.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Good morning, Bonnie.\nBonnie Herzog: I had a question on your HTU shipment volume for the year. You mentioned you're now expecting to come in within the lower half of your guidance. And then you highlighted a few reasons for this, including the uncertainty related to inventory levels in Europe given the upcoming flavor ban. So could you give us a sense of maybe where inventory levels are at right now? And then maybe how many quarters do you expect some of this unwind to happen? And then, just thinking about the trade, is this being offset in any way with -- I'm just thinking about combustible cig inventories? Or really, how is the trade responding to this ban?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes, Bonnie. So I think it's, of course, something on which we will be able to elaborate once we have been landing the year after the ban put in place on where the country are implementing it at the end of October [indiscernible] in all countries. One of the questions we have is, as with some reduction with some SKUs, does it mean that they are globally going to reduce the level of inventory and can this impact the level of shipment toward the year-end? So I think we're flying that because, of course, we continue to be with a view that this ban should not ultimately bring major disruption, and we've been elaborating on many occasions on why we think that this ban is not going to ultimately change the dynamic in the category. But it's so that we have some question mark on the landing for the reason I've just been describing on the level of inventory. That's why we are -- I mentioned we need to make sure that we are as clear as possible on the possible, I would say, temporary effect that this could generate. Now when I look at our shipments for the year. So we are clarifying the lending area. When I look at the 2023 performance versus 2022 performance, that will mean even in the low end of the bracket, an acceleration in terms of growth versus the growth that we experienced in 2022 in terms of incremental billion of [indiscernible] being sold. And of course, shipments are, as we know, what we are selling, what is probably more important is the consumer offtake. And here, frankly, we see the momentum continuing with no change. And I think the Q3 number where we have seasonality. But when we look at Q3, what we expect for Q4, we are very much with the same strong 15% to 16% IMS growth. And we are in line with what we have experienced last year. So that shows -- and by the way, it's a percentage on a higher base. So in fact, in volume, that means that the volume growth is higher. So we don't see any change in the momentum. We see a lot of strength in the growth, and that's visible in the volume and the market share that we are reporting today for Q3.\nBonnie Herzog: Okay. That's helpful. And then just in terms of another question, I just wanted to ask on your new IQOS users in the quarter. It did come in a bit light. You highlighted that this is normal quarterly seasonal trend. So maybe could you talk through that a bit further for us? And then maybe what other drivers might be impacting this? And essentially, how much visibility do you have in terms of Q4? You mentioned you expect a substantial acceleration in user growth this quarter. So I just kind of wanted to verify what you're seeing so far in October gives you that confidence. And is it realistic to assume a typical $1 million average quarterly run rate moving forward? Thanks.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Sure, Bonnie. So actually, last year, we were flat in terms of user acquisition. So we're doing better this year than last year in terms of user evolution. And I think we are in line with what we experienced in 2021, if I remember well, I think we've been sharing the numbers. So that's a typical pattern for Q3 which is due to the mythology on how we calculate the user growth. And I think we have today the -- as I said, the element of the momentum that we are seeing on people buying the device and people registering that is pointing to the fact that we see the same momentum, there is no change. And last year, we finished the year with a strong user growth, and we target to do the same this year. So I have to say it's remarkably stable in the strength, if I can use this expression. And as I said, we could be at the end of the day, in fact, growing in shipments and in IMS volume more than last year. So the percentage is about the same. Again, the basis being higher, it means that we're going to increase in terms of volume differential year-on-year.\nBonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gaurav Jain with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nGaurav Jain: Hi, good morning.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Good morning, Gaurav.\nGaurav Jain: So I have a question on the U.S. cigar side of things. So clearly, the FDA stand as rule-making process to ban flavored cigars to the [OMB] (ph). So first, how will you address that? And secondly, if I look at the reported numbers on cigars, it seems that the revenue had a pretty steep decline this quarter. Can you help us understand what's happening there?\nEmmanuel Babeau: So on the trend, we've been increasing price. I mean the cigar had been below a certain threshold for a period of time and we decided to move above this ratio, which was $1.14. And there is a time for adaptation and that explains why on volume we are impacted this year. But I don't think it reflects what's going to happen in the long term where we continue to have very good brands and with a lot of consumer support. Frankly, on the flavor, will you allow me not to speculate. I mean, I don't know exactly what are the plans. What it\u2019s going to mean, how long it would take, what is decided, and again, nobody actually knows what could be decided, how long it's going to take to be implemented. So I'm not going to speculate at this stage on what would be our answer and what we would do because I'm not going to be relevant on anything that could be seen at that stage.\nGaurav Jain: Sure. Thank you. And then my second question is on FY 2024 EPS and what's the base we should use to project that? Because I heard a comment that the Argentinian balance sheet revaluation impact, which is about $0.06 that will not recur in FY 2024. So we should add back to FY 2023 EPS? And then could you also just comment on Russia exposure and the [CLCPS] (ph)?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes. So this is a technical comment on Argentina. Gaurav, you're absolutely right. This is a ForEx impact that is a kind of one-off, if you want, because that is impacting this year but next year, we're not starting with the base on our profit that is decreased by that. It's just something that you need to book on your balance sheet exposure. But what is taken is taken. I mean, of course, depending on the evolution of the Argentinian peso in the future. But I don't have anything to say at this stage. I think I just wanted to clarify this technical impact. On Russia, frankly, versus when we made three weeks ago, there is nothing new to report on the Russian situation. This is a market where, of course, we are being very significantly impacted on the profit reported in dollars because of the very strong weakening of the Russian ruble versus the dollar. And that is one of the, if not, the biggest impact this year on ForEx. That is, of course, I would say, mechanically reducing our exposure to Russia in our profit. That's mechanical. And we are -- as we already said, we are seeing very limited growth in Russia, that is a market where as we've been saying, we've been reducing our commercial activity and [indiscernible] market where we're investing and that is translating, of course, on the performance of this market.\nGaurav Jain: Thank you so much.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Gaurav.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nPamela Kaufman: Hi, good morning.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Hi, Pam. Good morning.\nPamela Kaufman: I have a question on the combustible business. It's been exceeding expectations, and you've taken up your guidance for volumes on the combustible strength. Can you talk about what's driving the performance in this category, despite the acceleration in pricing growth?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Sure, Pam. Happy to do that. So yes, combustible is being resilient. We have a decline, but it's a modest decline in Q3. Let's be clear, this is driven by a few market where we see a nice share gain. One is Turkey, the other one is Egypt. As you can imagine, they are not market with great profitability per stick. So let's be very clear. We have a nice performance on combustible on volume, to some extent on revenue. All the great work that we are doing now on increasing OI and growing margin is first and foremost driven by our smoke-free product, IQOS first, ZYN second and [indiscernible]. So yes, great performance when it comes to volumes, greater performance versus the decline that we have seen in the past few years. Good impact on revenue. We've been doing good on price increase as well. But remember, that's a category on which we've seen a lot of inflation on our cost and part of the growth is generated by market with low profitability.\nPamela Kaufman: Okay. Thank you. And then on ZYN, when do you expect to hear a decision from the FDA on ZYN's PMTA applications? And how are you thinking about the prospects for ZYN flavor approvals, considering the FDA has recently issued unfavorable decisions around flavored e-cig products.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Look, we discussed that three weeks ago and there is nothing new on the PMTA. We don't know what's going to be the time line. It's at the discretion of the FDA, and we see that a lot of things are taking significant time to be -- decision to be taken. Let me make a couple of comments on this PMTA process, nevertheless. The first one is that, we have with our snuff product, [indiscernible] an MRTPA of Level 1. So the FDA has been recognized that this product are representing a reduced risk versus combustible cigarettes and we're very clear as benefit claim. We believe that by nature, this product should be considered as equally good, if not better. And we believe that they have the potential to really convince million of smokers to move away from combustible cigarettes to have a better way of consuming nicotine. So we are really helpful that -- hopeful that the FDA will really take that as a very important element and that it's important to make this product available for nicotine users in the U.S. Now on the flavor, because I think that was probably one of your questions. For the same reason, we believe it is important that the consumer has the choice of flavor, if it is a reason for them to move away from combustible cigarettes to this better product. Having said that, we have the example of a ban on flavor in California. And the reality is that, there was an adjustment during a couple of months, and then the [rules] (ph) resumed without flavor in California and we are today very, very significantly, I think we are close to 30% above the pre-ban level in California. So it shows that these products are extremely attractive and resonate with the nicotine user, with the smokers and with other nicotine users beyond the flavor, which is very good news.\nPamela Kaufman: Great. Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Pam.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Smith with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Smith: Hi, good morning, Emmanuel.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Good morning, Matt.\nMatthew Smith: If we take the full year organic profit margin guidance, the down 150 basis points or so and the year-to-date performance, along with your commentary around kind of a flattish year-over-year performance in the fourth quarter, can you talk about some of the factors in the fourth quarter. I understand there's a lot of crosswinds here, but you get the benefit of Swedish Match rolling into the organic base. And then you mentioned you've completed the shift to -- back to sea freight for HTU consumables in Japan. So can you talk about some of the headwinds to margin in the fourth quarter? Maybe some detail around your expectations around the incremental ILUMA launches or any other factors would be helpful.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Sure. So indeed, there are going to be some mix impact in Q4 and notably on the devices as we are rolling out ILUMA in a significant number of new markets. We are also launching some new innovation in some markets on the ILUMA device. That's going to generate, I would say, significantly accelerated activity on our device sales, and that is having a negative impact on the margin. So that's going to be clearly one element. Then on top of that, there will be certainly some investment during the fourth quarter, and that is having an impact on the margin. And then you can have some mix coming from geographies and other mix element. That is what is today behind the guidance of around flat. I mean it doesn't mean that it's going to be a bit positive. But today, we are seeing this around stability situation for our OI margin year-on-year organically for Q4.\nMatthew Smith: Thank you for that. And just as a follow-up, when you talk about investments in the fourth quarter, should we think of that as a sequential step-up in investment relative to the level in the third quarter? Or is that more of a year-over-year higher investment compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. And I'll leave it there.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes, I think you should expect certainly a continuation of a significant level of investment as we are accompanying the growth of our star product, IQOS and ZYN. That should probably mean quarter-on-quarter, I would say, sequential increase and still a significant growth versus last year.\nMatthew Smith: Thank you for that.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Owen Bennett with Jefferies.\nOwen Bennett: Good morning, Emmanuel. Hope you are well.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Good morning, Owen.\nOwen Bennett: I just wanted to ask also ZYN very, very strong in the U.S., but I wanted to ask about pouches ex U.S. So volumes only flat versus 2Q for Scandi and ex-Scandi. You mentioned you also had relaunches in Switzerland and Finland during the quarter. So I was just wondering how you see the near-term outlook for volumes at U.S.? Do you expect any meaningful acceleration over the next several quarters? And then the second question linked to that, there's some increasing chatter now that the EU is looking to potentially ban pouches as part of the new TPD. Does this impact how you think about investing in the space ex-U.S. near term? Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you. Yes. So we have this situation in Scandinavia on nicotine pouch where the product is already present, mainly in Sweden, where it's a nicely growing market. That's not where we enjoyed the biggest market share. So we are globally year-to-date, growing on nicotine pouch in Sweden, but are not -- we're not talking about big volumes here as we have our strong leadership in Sweden on snus. Outside Scandinavia, we are just at the beginning. So yes, we are launching. So we explained that we've been launching in Switzerland, Finland as well, even in the Nordics. There will be more market to come. Now it's going to be hopefully nice, but it's going to be small versus what we see in the U.S. You see what I mean. So it's going to be difficult to see given the strength that we are seeing in the U.S. to see volume outside the U.S. showing their strengths. Now yes, it's going to add very nicely additional numbers. But again, it's not going to be huge compared to the U.S. We'll see with TPD if there is any decision taken around nicotine pouch. Of course, if there is anything decided that will -- in that respect, which we don't know today that may influence the way we invest on this category in the EU. But frankly, at that stage, it's too early to say because we don't know what's going to be discussed, if anything on that one. And therefore, we'll see.\nOwen Bennett: Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will come from Andrei Condrea with UBS.\nAndrei Condrea: Hi. Good morning, Emmanuel. Just one from me, please. And I know it's a bit of a topic to [Joe] (ph), but the GLP-1 drug, obviously, there's been talk about it having anti-addictive properties. Do you think this could be an issue for PMI in the long term, rather? Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Frankly, I mean, I've been hearing things about that. I mean I know what the assumption is everybody going to be under GLP-1, and therefore, they're going to drive massive change in consumer behavior. And I'm not even able to tell you what would be the impact for somebody who is a nicotine user and is going to take GLP-1. I'm not sure we have any serious study on human behavior on that that is going to say that. So first of all, I don't know how broad the usage of this medicine as drug is going to be. Second, I don't know what's going to be the potential impact. So I'm not sure that today we can say anything relevant and that makes sense on that topic.\nAndrei Condrea: No. That makes sense. Thank you very much.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to Emmanuel for closing remarks.\nJames Bushnell: Hi. This is James Bushnell, Vice President of Investor Relations. That concludes our call today. Thank you again for joining us. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations team. Thank you again, and have a great day.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, talk to you soon. Bye-bye.\nOperator: This does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

            "name": "Emmanuel Babeau",
            "content": "Thank you, James, and welcome, everyone. We delivered very strong and better than expected performance in Q3, driven by IQOS and ZYN. Adjusted Diluted EPS grew by an excellent plus 20% in currency neutral terms to reach a record quarterly high of $1.67, despite a significant adverse currency impact in the period. Once again, our total volumes were positive, with the Q3 progression of over plus 2% positioning us to deliver our third straight year of growth. While not yet in our organic metrics, ZYN continued its exceptional growth with US volumes up by plus 66% in Q3 and over plus 50% year-to-date with a substantial increase in category share. Importantly, our IQOS business delivered another strong quarter with HTU shipment growing plus 18%, in line with the year-to-day trend. As covered at our recent Investor Day, HTU volumes have excellent unique economics relative to cigarettes, and the plus 16.5% organic net revenue growth from smoke-free product was a key driver in both our high single digit organic top line and double digit organic operating income growth. Smoke-free products made up over 36% of total net revenue in the quarter as we drive toward our new ambition of over two-thirds by 2030, making us substantially smoke-free. In combustibles, we delivered very robust performance with plus 6% growth in organic net revenues, strong pricing and higher category share despite the impact of adult smokers moving to smoke-free product. Our impressive operating income growth drove organic year-on-year margin expansion and a sequential improvement compared to the second quarter. This includes [healthy] (ph) expansion in the gross margin of our IQOS business, which surpassed combustible in the period and lower than expected commercial costs. Overall, we are pleased to report another strong quarter and we look forward with confidence to the remainder of the year and beyond. Turning now to the headline numbers. We surpassed $9 billion in quarterly net revenues for the first time as strong positive volume and continued excellent IQOS momentum supported organic net revenue growth of plus 9.3%. This organic growth does not include the impressive plus 22% adjusted ex-currency top line growth of Swedish Match led by ZYN. Our organic net revenue per unit grew by plus 7%, driven by the increasing proportion of IQOS HTUs in our sales mix and very firm combustible pricing of plus 9%. This positive top line and mixed performance drove very strong organic operating income growth of plus 11.3% and organic margin expansion of plus 70 basis points. Again, this excludes the exceptional performance of Swedish Match, which is included in our adjusted diluted EPS. We delivered adjusted diluted earning per share growth of plus 20.3% excluding an unfavorable currency impact of $0.17 notably due to the Russian ruble and the balance sheet related currency impact in Argentina, as disclosed at our recent Investor Day. Sequentially, lower net financing costs were broadly offset by a higher tax rate. Our excellent third quarter combined with the robust H1 resulted in strong delivery year-to-date. I want to highlight our volume growth of plus 1.5% and organic net revenue growth of plus 7.7%, again, reflecting continued dynamic IQOS performance and combustible pricing. In addition, Swedish Match currency neutral net revenues increased by plus 18%, excluding accounting reclassifications. Year-to-date, operating income grew by plus 2.4 organically, despite accentuated margin headwinds and notable OI decline in the first quarter due to the headwinds covered previously, which are now starting to subside. Combined with outstanding ZYN performance, this resulted in year-to-date currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 10.7% to $4.65. This is an excellent performance. Turning now to the full year outlook. I am pleased to share that following this very strong year-to-date delivery, we are raising our volume, organic sales growth and currency neutral adjusted bottom line growth forecast. First to volumes, where we increase our outlook to plus 1%, to plus 1.5% total shipment growth for cigarettes and HTUs, despite a lower expectation for the total industry. Within this, we expect to deliver HTU shipment volume within the lower half of our prior 125 billion to 130 billion range. While IQOS fundamentals remain strong, this narrowing reflects a further delay to the expected market launch in Taiwan, limited underlying growth in Russia and Ukraine, as well as some uncertainty related to inventory level in the EU as trade partner adjusts to the upcoming HTU flavor ban. For combustible, the resilience of our portfolio is reflected in an updated forecast of a 1% to 2% cigarette volume decline. ZYN continues to perform exceptionally with strong adult consumer traction. Following a further step up in the US volume run rate, we are now increasing our full year nicotine pouch forecast range to 390 million to 410 million cans. Combining the improved volume outlook with robust pricing and continued positive mix, we are narrowing our organic net revenue growth forecast to around plus 8%, the midpoint of our previous range. As I will come back to shortly, we expect excellent organic OI growth over the second half of the year. Combining this strong profit performance with the continuation of ZYN's phenomenal growth and diligent cost management allows us to raise our currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth forecast to plus 10% to plus 10.5%. This means we now expect double digit growth for the third year running and translate into a full-year range of $6.05 to $6.08, including an estimated unfavorable currency impact of $0.53 at prevailing rates. Last, despite increased currency headwinds, we continue to expect operating cash flow of around $10 billion for the year. This sets us up nicely as we focus on deleveraging towards our target of around 2 times adjusted net debt to EBITDA in 2026. Now, let me provide a different view of our forecasted results. As you can see, 2023 has very much been a year of two halves with a number of accentuated headwinds in H1, as explained in prior quarters, including steep cost inflation. H2 is a different story, and we believe it is more reflective of the underlying trajectory of our business. First, we expect an accelerated H2 top line with organic growth of around plus 9%. Second, we expect a significant re-acceleration in profit growth. We continue to expect organic operating income margin expansion in H2, and we are well on track after delivering another quarter of sequential adjusted OI margin improvement in Q3, with margins also expanding organically year-on-year. In H2, we expect strong organic operating income growth of around 10%. For the full-year, our expectation remains that organic margin evolution will be towards the lower-end of our minus 50 basis point to minus 150 basis point range, including the expected technical margin impact of around 40 basis points from third-party arrangement in Indonesia and Ukraine. For Q4, we expect strong operating income growth with broadly stable year-on-year organic margin provision. This includes the expectation of higher device sales as we accelerate our ILUMA rollout to reach around 50 markets by year end, complemented by further ILUMA device innovation. This very positive organic OI trajectory in H2 naturally translate into an acceleration in currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth posted by Swedish Match. Now turning back to our results, our total shipment volume increased by plus 2.2% for Q3 and plus 1.5% year-to-date, putting us comfortably on track to deliver our third sequential year of growth. HTU shipment volumes grew by plus 18% in Q3 to reach 32.5 billion units, driven by continued strong performance in Europe and Japan. Adjusting for inventory movement, including the transition back to sea freight, Q3 adjusted IMS grew by plus 14.4%. This includes Europe at plus 16% despite heightened competitive activity, notably in Poland. And a more normalized growth rate in Japan of plus 12%. Excluding Russia and Ukraine where growth remains limited, our adjusted IMS advanced by a very robust plus 16%. These growth rates exclude the excellent development of oral nicotine for which shipment volume grew by plus 19% in Q3 and plus 14% year-to-date on a pro-forma basis, including the US growth of ZYN of plus 66% and plus 56%, respectively. If we were to add the growth of nicotine pouches on a unit basis, our Q3 proforma smoke-free volume grew by plus 19.5% and our total volumes by plus 2.5%. Cigarette volumes declined by a modest 0.5% in Q3 with strong performance in Turkey and Egypt and by 1.3% year-to-date, reflecting solid category share performance in a resilient category, despite robust pricing. I will now walk through the mechanics of our Q3 net revenues. In addition to plus 2.2% volume growth, pricing contributed plus 6.2 points of growth as combustibles remain strong and the negative impact on HTU pricing of the annualization of excise tax increases in Japan and Germany, notably moderated. The increasing proportion of HTUs in our business continues to be a consistent top-line driver, reflecting higher net revenue per unit. The positive mix impact of HTU's overall volume growth and pricing are powerful drivers of our transformation and growth. We expect ZYN to enhance this further as it starts to be included in our organic metrics from mid-Q4. Looking now at adjusted operating income, where the $3.7 billion delivered in Q3 is also a record-high. I am pleased to report that following peak margin headwind in Q1, our organic growth has accelerated nicely as inflation, supply-chain disruption and ILUMA related factors continue to moderate. And the underlying dynamics of our transformation bear fruits. The Q3 progression is slightly above our 2024, 2026 CAGR target of plus 8% to plus 10% organic operating income growth. And as I covered earlier, we expect our overall H2 OI growth to be around the top of this range. This strong operating income growth in excess of an already healthy topline performance drove a better-than-expected organic margin expansion of plus 70 basis-points in the quarter. This was also the first-quarter this year, where gross margin expanded organically, notably, due to lower shipping costs, ILUMA margin improvement and lower device sales compared to the prior year. SG&A cost were also organically lower as a percentage of net revenue reflecting a good cost performance and some phasing between the third and fourth quarter. We delivered a further $120 million in gross cost efficiencies in Q3, now surpassing our $2 billion target for 2021-2023. We aim to continue this run rate, as reflected in our 2024-2026 target of an incremental $2 billion in gross savings. The Q3 margin currency variance include a 0.6 points impact from the Argentina balance sheet related item I mentioned earlier. By its nature, this does not carry-forward to future periods. Now moving to Swedish Match which is meaningfully accelerating our smoke-free growth trajectory as we progress towards becoming substantially smoke-free by 2030. Swedish Match business delivered excellent adjusted currency-neutral net revenue growth of plus 22% in Q3 and plus 18% year-to-date. This means that our adjusted pro forma year-to-date topline growth was 60 basis points higher at plus 8.3%. Swedish Match strong profitability also enhanced our year-to-date adjusted operating income margin by plus 70 basis-points. As we covered at Investor Day, Swedish Match smoke-free portfolio has excellent economic and is already at significant size compared to total PMI with its product contribution or operating profit before G&A to be clear, approaching one quarter of our total smoke-free business year-to-date. ZYN remains the key performance driver as it delivered another remarkable US performance with plus 66% volume growth, reflecting positive momentum across the country. Elsewhere in smoke-free recent trends of share gain in US moist snuff, as well as category mix headwinds in Scandinavia broadly continued. We continue to be very pleased with the positive impact of Swedish Match on our company and I would like to thank the team for delivering such a great performance. Now, let's examine ZYN's recent US performance in more detail. Exceptional progress continued in Q3 with an increase in 12 months rolling shipment volume growth of plus 62% compared to Q3 2022 and plus 14% sequentially. Impressively, ZYN Q3 category volume share grew to 70.8%, which is plus 4.7 points higher year-on year and plus 2.4 point -- 2.5 point sequentially. Retail value share remained strong at around 76%, highlighting ZYN's premium positioning and superior brand equity. This accelerated growth reflect progressive increase in distribution and a further broad step up in nationwide store velocity as the category gains strong traction with adult nicotine users for its convenience and pleasurable experience. Now focusing on IQOS starting with user groups. We estimate there were 27.4 million IQOS users as of September 30th, this represent an increase of 3.7 million user versus one year-ago and 0.2 million compared to Q2 2023. As shown on the right-hand side of the slide, the third-quarter of each year typically experiences slower user growth due to the seasonal influences in the calculation. Both new user registration and devices to legal age smokers continue to advance strongly and at levels broadly in line with Q2 when users grew by 1.4 million sequentially. Also, as in prior years, we expect a substantial acceleration in user growth in the fourth quarter. Moving now to IQOS in the Europe region, where our third quarter HTU share increased by plus 1.3 points to 8.6% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume. Continued share gains include the growing take-up of ILUMA, which is available to over 80% of IQOS users in the region. In addition to Q3 launches in Denmark and the UK, ILUMA was launched in Poland, which, like Japan, is a market with high competitive activity. We look forward to driving its performance here over the coming quarters. While sequential share is, as usual, optically affected by the seasonality of the cigarette category, adjusted IMS volumes continue to exhibit robust sequential growth and reached a record high on the four quarter moving average. This reflects strong year-on-year growth of plus 16% in Q3, despite limited growth in Ukraine. We expect strong IMS volume growth to continue in Q4, with a corresponding increase in market share. In the EU, the majority of member states have transposed a delegated directive withdrawing the heated tobacco product exemption from the characterizing flavor ban international law. The ban in this market will be effective as of October 23rd and the remaining markets are expected to adopt in 2024. As previously mentioned, we are adjusting our HTU portfolio as required in line with this transposition, and while short-term volatility is possible, including in year-end trend inventories. We do not expect significant change in the structural growth of the category. In Japan, IQOS ILUMA celebrated its second anniversary of the national launch in September and continues to exhibit strong growth due to excellent conversion, consumer satisfaction, and retention rates. Adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by plus 3 points in Q3 year-over-year to 26.6%. Importantly, adjusted in market sales volume again grew sequentially on the four-quarter moving average, reaching over 10 billion units for the first time in Q3 2023, as IQOA outgrew the heat-not-burn category. In addition to this excellent consumer trend, our Q3 shipment to Japan also benefited from further switching back to sea freight during the quarter. This shift is now substantially progressed and we expect a more normalized rate of HTU shipment in Q4. Our premium-priced TEREA HTUs and mainstream priced SENTIA HTUs continued to grow individually and in aggregate, reaching Q3 offtake shares of around 18% and 8%, respectively, despite the impact of seasonality. Our Japan city shares also continue to progress with a number reaching over 30%. We continue to see a long runway of growth in Japan over the coming quarters. In addition to strong IQOS gains in developed countries, we continue to see very promising growth in low and middle income markets. This slide highlights a selection of Q3 key cities offtake share across markets in Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. We see notable ongoing success in Egypt with Cairo offtake share of plus 3.5 points to almost 9%. And in Santo Domingo our leading Latin America city, with offtake share around 8%. Most promising is a 3.1% offtake share in [Urban] (ph) Jakarta, where IQOS is only available via the IQOS Club Members program. We continue to see robust offtake volume growth across this important future market, despite seasonal effect on sequential share metrics. I'd like to spend a moment now on combustibles, where our portfolio delivered strong organic net revenue growth of plus 6.2% in Q3 and plus 5.6% year-to-date. This reflect another strong quarter of pricing with notable contribution from Germany and Indonesia. With better-than-expected pricing in Q3 of plus 9% and plus 8.6% year-to-date, we now forecast a full-year increase of plus 8% to plus 8.5%. Our cigarette category share grew by plus 0.6 point in Q3 and plus 0.3 points year-to-date. This reflects notable contribution from Egypt, Poland and Turkey, resulting in only modest volume decline. Our leadership in combustibles helps to maximize switching to smoke-free product and we have fully achieved our ongoing objective of stable category share over the last two years, despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization. This combustible share performance combined with the structural growth of IQOS supports robust overall market-share gains. We captured plus 0.9 point of international cigarette and HTU share in Q3. And plus 0.7 points year-to-date. As covered at Investor Day, our superior share of smoke-free product give us a formidable platform for sustainable market-share gains with superior unique economics. Now let me update you briefly on our exciting innovation and expansion activities, which will be critical as we aim to reach over two-third smoke-free net revenue by 2030, including 60 markets over 50% and 40 markets of over 75%. As we covered at Investor Day, the global rollout of IQOS ILUMA continues. We launched ILUMA in four markets in Q3 reaching 27 markets in total, which represent around 75% of our IQOS business by volume. ILUMA continues to generate excellent growth with upgrades from existing user and new user acquisition. With a further six market launch already this month, we expect ILUMA to be present in around 50 market by year-end and to essentially complete the rollout next year. As also mentioned during Investor Day, superior tobacco taste is critical to our ongoing success, and we are further exploring complex and new test spaces to enhance our tobacco flavor experience. On the other end of the consumer preference spectrum, we will be offering zero tobacco consumable for non-tobacco flavored discovery under the LEVIA brand. Just as nicotine pouches are an evolution from snus to make the oral category relevant to more adult smokers, LEVIA is a similar non tobacco evolution for IQOS, as we broaden our offering to increase switching away from combustibles. The US represents the most significant opportunity to drive accelerated smoke-free growth at both the top and bottom line. We are continuing to invest behind ZYN and readying our organizational and commercial capabilities for the launch of IQOS in Q2 2024 and a scaled-up rollout with ILUMA once authorized. We remain on track to file for IQOS ILUMA's PMTA and MRTPA this months. The international expansion of nicotine pouches remain a key mid to long-term focus, notably for ZYN as the world's leading brand. During the third-quarter, we relaunched ZYN in Switzerland and following positive regulatory developments rolled out ZYN in Finland. Moving now to sustainability. Addressing the product health impact of combustible product by switching adult smoker to smoke-free product, which are designed and marketed for adult-use remains our most critical priority. This transformation is at the core of our strategy as we become a more sustainable business with accelerated growth and returns over time. With regard to tackling climate change, I am delighted to report that the Science Based Target initiative validated our forest land and agriculture emission reduction target, a recognition achieved by very few companies. We pledge to reduce this absolute Scope 3 emission by 33% by 2030, which is significant given that Scope 3 remain the most challenging aspect of any company decarbonization strategy. In September, almost 20,000 employees in over 60 countries participated in World Cleanup Day, showcasing our commitment to raising awareness around littering as part of our wider strategy to reduce post-consumer waste. We have long expressed our support for more rigor in sustainability related reporting and welcome recent moves towards greater consistency in standard under strong governance framework. As part of our ongoing work, we provided responses to consultation request from the International Sustainability Standard Board to have shared the development of their work plan, an update to the [SASB] standards. PMI continues to be recognized by [indiscernible] such as the World Business Council for Sustainable Development as the leader in non-financial reporting. We have much more to share on our sustainability effort and transformation. [indiscernible] will be presenting at the CECP CEO Investor Forum in New York on November 14th, and the event is open to all those who would like to attend. To conclude today's presentation, we continue to deliver sustainable growth through our transformation. The powerful trajectory of our smoke-free business give us confidence in strong full-year results, built on volume growth, positive mix, pricing and cost management. Considering the headwinds faced, notably in the first part of the year. We believe this speaks strongly to the fundamentals of our growth model. Notably, the outstanding performance of IQOS and ZYN continues, further enhancing our position as the global smoke-free champion. We have exciting plans to accelerate our smoke-free future in both the US. The largest smoke-free market and internationally. We are confident in our 2024-2026 CAGR target of plus 6% to plus 8% organic topline growth, plus 8% to plus 10% organic operating income growth and plus 9% to plus 11% currency-neutral adjusted EPS growth. We also as a clear guiding objective with our new ambition to be substantially smoke-free by net revenue in 2030 as another key milestone on our journey toward the smoke-free future. And finally with our latest dividend raise in September, we have delivered 16 years of continuous dividend increase since our 2008 spin, despite the ups and downs of economic and currency cycle. This translate to cumulative 183% increase and CAGR of 77.2% since 2008 with an annualized dividend of $5.20. As these demonstrate our commitment to shareholder return through a progressive dividend remain steadfast. Thank you very much. And we are now extremely happy to answer your questions. Good morning, Vivien. Thank you, Vivien. So on ZYN and of course, every quarter will bring its new, I would say, load of news. And I think we see in Q3 another great quarter of acceleration in the velocity that means that where the brand is already even nicely present, we see the consumer offtake accelerating. It just show that this product are becoming more relevant for a growing number of adult user and that's a great news. There is also the geographical dimension on which we elaborated at the time of our Investor Day and which is showing that, while the brand has a certain level of presence on the western part of the U.S., it doesn't mean that it isn't going to grow it further, but it's, of course, bigger than the rest of the country. There seems to be a trajectory that is saying that the rest of the country is going to adopt it progressively, and that is indeed giving also a nice, I would say, trajectory on further growth in the coming quarters and years, of course. We talk here about probably years of very nice growth. So it's great that we have beyond ZYN, two engine, which is really where the brand is already with the biggest presence. We don't see any decrease in the consumer adoption, and we see increase, what we call the velocity. And we see progressively, I think, as well quarter-after-quarter, this geographical momentum building up as expected. Now on the margin, yes, it's true that this growth of ZYN is extremely positive when it comes to margin. Of course, we are going to continue to invest behind this growth potential in the U.S., and we will put the necessary commercial resources to make sure that we maximize the growth potential. But I said it, ZYN is really best-in-class in terms of gross margin for our product in -- at the group level. I'm talking about ZYN in the U.S., but globally in [indiscernible] nice margin, but ZYN in the U.S. is best in class. And that means, of course, that growing ZYN is an excellent news for top line, but also for bottom line. And I think that in the growth of the adjusted earnings per share over the quarter, this is absolutely visible. Thank you. Good morning, Bonnie. Yes, Bonnie. So I think it's, of course, something on which we will be able to elaborate once we have been landing the year after the ban put in place on where the country are implementing it at the end of October [indiscernible] in all countries. One of the questions we have is, as with some reduction with some SKUs, does it mean that they are globally going to reduce the level of inventory and can this impact the level of shipment toward the year-end? So I think we're flying that because, of course, we continue to be with a view that this ban should not ultimately bring major disruption, and we've been elaborating on many occasions on why we think that this ban is not going to ultimately change the dynamic in the category. But it's so that we have some question mark on the landing for the reason I've just been describing on the level of inventory. That's why we are -- I mentioned we need to make sure that we are as clear as possible on the possible, I would say, temporary effect that this could generate. Now when I look at our shipments for the year. So we are clarifying the lending area. When I look at the 2023 performance versus 2022 performance, that will mean even in the low end of the bracket, an acceleration in terms of growth versus the growth that we experienced in 2022 in terms of incremental billion of [indiscernible] being sold. And of course, shipments are, as we know, what we are selling, what is probably more important is the consumer offtake. And here, frankly, we see the momentum continuing with no change. And I think the Q3 number where we have seasonality. But when we look at Q3, what we expect for Q4, we are very much with the same strong 15% to 16% IMS growth. And we are in line with what we have experienced last year. So that shows -- and by the way, it's a percentage on a higher base. So in fact, in volume, that means that the volume growth is higher. So we don't see any change in the momentum. We see a lot of strength in the growth, and that's visible in the volume and the market share that we are reporting today for Q3. Sure, Bonnie. So actually, last year, we were flat in terms of user acquisition. So we're doing better this year than last year in terms of user evolution. And I think we are in line with what we experienced in 2021, if I remember well, I think we've been sharing the numbers. So that's a typical pattern for Q3 which is due to the mythology on how we calculate the user growth. And I think we have today the -- as I said, the element of the momentum that we are seeing on people buying the device and people registering that is pointing to the fact that we see the same momentum, there is no change. And last year, we finished the year with a strong user growth, and we target to do the same this year. So I have to say it's remarkably stable in the strength, if I can use this expression. And as I said, we could be at the end of the day, in fact, growing in shipments and in IMS volume more than last year. So the percentage is about the same. Again, the basis being higher, it means that we're going to increase in terms of volume differential year-on-year. Thank you. Good morning, Gaurav. So on the trend, we've been increasing price. I mean the cigar had been below a certain threshold for a period of time and we decided to move above this ratio, which was $1.14. And there is a time for adaptation and that explains why on volume we are impacted this year. But I don't think it reflects what's going to happen in the long term where we continue to have very good brands and with a lot of consumer support. Frankly, on the flavor, will you allow me not to speculate. I mean, I don't know exactly what are the plans. What it's going to mean, how long it would take, what is decided, and again, nobody actually knows what could be decided, how long it's going to take to be implemented. So I'm not going to speculate at this stage on what would be our answer and what we would do because I'm not going to be relevant on anything that could be seen at that stage. Yes. So this is a technical comment on Argentina. Gaurav, you're absolutely right. This is a ForEx impact that is a kind of one-off, if you want, because that is impacting this year but next year, we're not starting with the base on our profit that is decreased by that. It's just something that you need to book on your balance sheet exposure. But what is taken is taken. I mean, of course, depending on the evolution of the Argentinian peso in the future. But I don't have anything to say at this stage. I think I just wanted to clarify this technical impact. On Russia, frankly, versus when we made three weeks ago, there is nothing new to report on the Russian situation. This is a market where, of course, we are being very significantly impacted on the profit reported in dollars because of the very strong weakening of the Russian ruble versus the dollar. And that is one of the, if not, the biggest impact this year on ForEx. That is, of course, I would say, mechanically reducing our exposure to Russia in our profit. That's mechanical. And we are -- as we already said, we are seeing very limited growth in Russia, that is a market where as we've been saying, we've been reducing our commercial activity and [indiscernible] market where we're investing and that is translating, of course, on the performance of this market. Thank you, Gaurav. Hi, Pam. Good morning. Sure, Pam. Happy to do that. So yes, combustible is being resilient. We have a decline, but it's a modest decline in Q3. Let's be clear, this is driven by a few market where we see a nice share gain. One is Turkey, the other one is Egypt. As you can imagine, they are not market with great profitability per stick. So let's be very clear. We have a nice performance on combustible on volume, to some extent on revenue. All the great work that we are doing now on increasing OI and growing margin is first and foremost driven by our smoke-free product, IQOS first, ZYN second and [indiscernible]. So yes, great performance when it comes to volumes, greater performance versus the decline that we have seen in the past few years. Good impact on revenue. We've been doing good on price increase as well. But remember, that's a category on which we've seen a lot of inflation on our cost and part of the growth is generated by market with low profitability. Look, we discussed that three weeks ago and there is nothing new on the PMTA. We don't know what's going to be the time line. It's at the discretion of the FDA, and we see that a lot of things are taking significant time to be -- decision to be taken. Let me make a couple of comments on this PMTA process, nevertheless. The first one is that, we have with our snuff product, [indiscernible] an MRTPA of Level 1. So the FDA has been recognized that this product are representing a reduced risk versus combustible cigarettes and we're very clear as benefit claim. We believe that by nature, this product should be considered as equally good, if not better. And we believe that they have the potential to really convince million of smokers to move away from combustible cigarettes to have a better way of consuming nicotine. So we are really helpful that -- hopeful that the FDA will really take that as a very important element and that it's important to make this product available for nicotine users in the U.S. Now on the flavor, because I think that was probably one of your questions. For the same reason, we believe it is important that the consumer has the choice of flavor, if it is a reason for them to move away from combustible cigarettes to this better product. Having said that, we have the example of a ban on flavor in California. And the reality is that, there was an adjustment during a couple of months, and then the [rules] (ph) resumed without flavor in California and we are today very, very significantly, I think we are close to 30% above the pre-ban level in California. So it shows that these products are extremely attractive and resonate with the nicotine user, with the smokers and with other nicotine users beyond the flavor, which is very good news. Thank you, Pam. Good morning, Matt. Sure. So indeed, there are going to be some mix impact in Q4 and notably on the devices as we are rolling out ILUMA in a significant number of new markets. We are also launching some new innovation in some markets on the ILUMA device. That's going to generate, I would say, significantly accelerated activity on our device sales, and that is having a negative impact on the margin. So that's going to be clearly one element. Then on top of that, there will be certainly some investment during the fourth quarter, and that is having an impact on the margin. And then you can have some mix coming from geographies and other mix element. That is what is today behind the guidance of around flat. I mean it doesn't mean that it's going to be a bit positive. But today, we are seeing this around stability situation for our OI margin year-on-year organically for Q4. Yes, I think you should expect certainly a continuation of a significant level of investment as we are accompanying the growth of our star product, IQOS and ZYN. That should probably mean quarter-on-quarter, I would say, sequential increase and still a significant growth versus last year. Thank you. Good morning, Owen. Thank you. Yes. So we have this situation in Scandinavia on nicotine pouch where the product is already present, mainly in Sweden, where it's a nicely growing market. That's not where we enjoyed the biggest market share. So we are globally year-to-date, growing on nicotine pouch in Sweden, but are not -- we're not talking about big volumes here as we have our strong leadership in Sweden on snus. Outside Scandinavia, we are just at the beginning. So yes, we are launching. So we explained that we've been launching in Switzerland, Finland as well, even in the Nordics. There will be more market to come. Now it's going to be hopefully nice, but it's going to be small versus what we see in the U.S. You see what I mean. So it's going to be difficult to see given the strength that we are seeing in the U.S. to see volume outside the U.S. showing their strengths. Now yes, it's going to add very nicely additional numbers. But again, it's not going to be huge compared to the U.S. We'll see with TPD if there is any decision taken around nicotine pouch. Of course, if there is anything decided that will -- in that respect, which we don't know today that may influence the way we invest on this category in the EU. But frankly, at that stage, it's too early to say because we don't know what's going to be discussed, if anything on that one. And therefore, we'll see. Frankly, I mean, I've been hearing things about that. I mean I know what the assumption is everybody going to be under GLP-1, and therefore, they're going to drive massive change in consumer behavior. And I'm not even able to tell you what would be the impact for somebody who is a nicotine user and is going to take GLP-1. I'm not sure we have any serious study on human behavior on that that is going to say that. So first of all, I don't know how broad the usage of this medicine as drug is going to be. Second, I don't know what's going to be the potential impact. So I'm not sure that today we can say anything relevant and that makes sense on that topic. Thank you. Thank you, talk to you soon. Bye-bye."

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. James Bushnell, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.\nJames Bushnell: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2023 second-quarter results. The press release is available on our website at www.pmi.com. A glossary of terms, including the definition for smoke-free products, as well as adjustments, other calculations, and reconciliations to the most directly comparable US GAAP measures for non-GAAP financial measures cited in this presentation, and additional net revenue data, are available in Exhibit 99.2 to the company's Form 8-K dated July 20, 2023, and on our Investor Relations website. Growth rates presented on an organic basis reflect currency-neutral adjusted results, excluding acquisitions and disposals. As such, figures and comparisons presented on an organic basis exclude Swedish Match up until November 11, 2023.  Today\u2019s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements disclosure in today\u2019s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.  It is now my pleasure to introduce Emmanuel Babeau, our Chief Financial Officer. Over to you, Emmanuel.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, James, and welcome everyone. Our business delivered outstanding performance in the second quarter of 2023, exceeding our expectations to reach a record high quarterly adjusted diluted EPS of $1.60. This was driven by impressive ZYN and IQOS growth, coupled with strong combustible results. We delivered total cigarette and HTU shipment volume growth of 3.3%, putting us well on track for our third consecutive year of positive volumes. This excellent result underpinned double-digit organic topline growth and high-teens currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth. We also expanded our leadership in smoke-free products in the period. Firstly, IQOS\u2019 strong momentum continued, with adjusted in-market sales volumes, led by plus 16%, and shipments up by plus 27%. This reflects very good user growth of plus 1.4 million in the quarter and continued strong traction across the world. This is increasingly driven by IQOS ILUMA, which is now available in 23 markets, representing around two thirds of our IQOS business by volume. Secondly, and now two full quarters after the Swedish Match acquisition, ZYN is delivering an exceptional acceleration to our smoke-free business. US volumes grew by over plus 50%, including a notable step-up in June. We are delighted with this performance. Our combustible business also delivered better-than-expected results with over plus 7% organic net revenue growth after a very robust quarter for pricing and resilient volumes. This was a key contributor to the strong plus 7% organic operating income growth, with a plus 210 basis points sequential improvement in our adjusted operating income margin.  Turning to the headline numbers, positive volumes supported very strong organic topline growth of plus 10.5%, with continued excellent IQOS momentum and a further acceleration in combustible pricing. This does not include the remarkable plus 19% pro forma ex-currency topline growth of Swedish Match, led by ZYN, with combined pro forma ex-currency net revenues increasing by plus 11.1%. Our total reported currency-neutral net revenues grew by plus 19%. Our organic net revenue per unit grew by plus 7.0%, driven by the increasing proportion of IQOS HTUs in our sales mix and combustible pricing. Due to these positive factors, adjusted operating income grew by a very robust plus 7% organically despite continued inflationary headwinds. This excludes the tremendous growth of ZYN, and starting in Q4, our organic results will include Swedish Match. Adjusted OI margins improved 210 basis points sequentially, and while still organically lower year-on-year by 140 basis points, this better-than-expected performance was notably supported by combustible strength and favorable timing of certain costs. We also increased our participation in the below Tier 1 segment in Indonesia, which now represents close to 40% of its industry volumes, and is slightly dilutive to our margins. This organic delivery, including the favorable timing of costs, combined with exceptional June ZYN volumes, and a lower tax rate, allowed us to outperform our most recent Q2 forecast. We delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $1.60, representing 16.9% growth, excluding an unfavorable currency impact of $0.13, notably due to the Japanese yen.  While the first quarter of the year contained some exceptional headwinds and distortions due to timing and comparison effects, our business delivered a strong first half, including volume growth of 1.1%. Organic net revenues grew by 6.8%, with Swedish Match\u2019s excellent ex-currency pro forma net revenue growth of 17% for H1, demonstrating its growth accretion to our business. Combined pro forma currency-neutral net revenues increased by around 7.5%.  Following peak margin headwinds and a notable operating income decline in the first quarter, the strong improvement in Q2 narrowed the H1 organic decline to minus 2%. As in Q2, this excludes Swedish Match, which delivered an excellent profit performance and made a significant contribution to our adjusted OI margins. We expect continued strong reported and organic operating income growth in the second half. Despite these headwinds, we delivered 5.9% growth in currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS to $2.98 in H1, providing a strong platform for the second half of 2023 and beyond.  Let me now walk through the mechanics of our Q2 net revenues. While not included in our reported shipment volume growth of 3.3%, Swedish Match\u2019s smoke-free volumes grew by 15%, providing impressive accretion to our overall growth profile. Combustible and HTU pricing contributed plus 6 points of growth. This primarily reflects combustible strength, partly benefitting from timing effects. As in Q1, HTU pricing was impacted in Japan and Germany by the annualization of 2022 excise tax increases, and in the case of Japan, the transition to ILUMA. These factors will have less impact in the second half as annualization recedes. We also continue to expect greater visibility on the likely outcome of the court ruling related to the German tax surcharge toward the end of the year. The increasing proportion of HTUs in our business again contributed positively, reflecting higher net revenue per unit, partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix. The positive mix impact of HTUs, overall volume growth, and pricing, are powerful drivers of our transformation and growth.  Let\u2019s now turn to gross margins. While the year-on-year trajectory remained negative, we saw improvement versus the first quarter, driven by strong growth fundamentals. Indeed, we achieved sequential improvement of 1.2 percentage points despite increased inflationary pressures, as topline growth accelerated and supply chain disruptions and ILUMA-related factors started to dissipate in the quarter. In addition, cost phasing and the geographic mix of inventory movements, notably for HTUs in Europe, increasingly normalized after an adversely affected Q1. Our IQOS business contributed positively to our gross margin in Q2, and we expect this to continue, partly mitigating combustibles. We expect further improvement in our year-on-year gross margin trajectory in H2 as headwinds continue to subside, ZYN\u2019s outstanding growth continues, and the underlying drivers of our transformation accelerate. As expected, SG&A growth was much closer to net revenue growth in Q2, and at a more normalized growth rate with regard to our full year expectations. Indeed, with such a strong topline in Q2, SG&A costs were lower as a percentage of net revenues. While we continue to invest in IQOS and ZYN, our successful cost efficiency programs continue to deliver, helping to finance growth investments and mitigate inflation, which remains a headwind. With $1.9 billion of gross savings realized to date, including $820 million from SG&A, we are on track to achieve our 2021-23 $2 billion target ahead of plan. Turning now to the 2023 outlook, we are raising our currency-neutral top and bottom-line growth forecasts. We aim to be a growth company starting with volumes. In 2023, we expect to grow total volumes for the third year in a row, even before factoring in the excellent progress of Swedish Match\u2019s portfolio. As part of this growth, we are reiterating our targeted HTU shipment range of $125 billion to $132 billion, while we expect a cigarette volume decline of 1.5% to 2.5%. We are increasing our organic net revenue growth forecast to 7.5% to 8.5%, reflecting the continued momentum of IQOS, the resilience of our combustible business, and the ongoing excellent growth of ZYN, which we expect to contribute positively in Q4. We expect strong organic operating income growth in the remainder of the year to support H2 margin expansion despite the headwinds previously mentioned and certain technical impacts. These relate to the increased use of third-party manufacturing in a few markets, such as Indonesia and Ukraine, and the related growth of the below Tier 1 segment in Indonesia I already mentioned. The full year estimated impact of these factors is around 40 basis points on our adjusted OI margin, and without this impact, we would expect to be broadly in the middle of our forecast organic margin range. On top of this organic evolution, we expect Swedish Match to add around 50 basis points of accretion.  Our strong topline and OI outlook allows us to raise our forecast for currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth to 8% to 9.5%. This translates to a revised range of $6.13 to $6.22, including $0.33 from unfavorable currency at prevailing exchange rates, notably due to the Japanese yen and Russian ruble. This forecast continues to assume around $150 million for incremental investments in the US, and our Wellness and Healthcare business. It also assumes around $1.2 billion in net finance costs, which includes higher interest on variable debt, partly offset by better returns on cash deposits. As previously mentioned, our forecasts do not assume any contribution from a potential favorable ruling on the Germany tax surcharge.  Focusing on the second half in more detail, we expect strong performance on all key metrics as smoke-free products deliver an increasingly positive impact. In Q3, we forecast high single-digit organic topline growth, with HTU shipments of 31 billion to 33 billion units, and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.60 to $1.65, including $0.06 of unfavorable currency at prevailing exchange rates. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect notably strong reported and organic OI growth as certain inflationary impacts are annualized, and we increasingly benefit from an optimized ILUMA supply chain and consumables. As I mentioned, Swedish Match will also be included in our organic figures during the quarter. The exceptional growth of ZYN is clearly margin-accretive, as visible in our adjusted H1 figures.  Turning back to our results, our total shipment volumes increased by 3.3% for Q2, and 1.1% year-to-date. HTU shipment volumes grew by 26.6% in Q2 to reach 31.4 billion units, notably driven by continued strong performance in Europe and Japan. In addition to fundamental strength, HTU shipments to Japan were boosted in Q2 by around 2 billion units as we increased sea freight, with corresponding increases in inventory levels. As I mentioned earlier, total PMI adjusted in-market sales volumes of HTUs increased by 16% in Q2, continuing the excellent trend seen in Q1. H1 shipment volumes grew by 18.5%. Notably, this does not include the excellent growth prospects of oral nicotine, for which shipment volumes grew by 14% in Q2 and 12% in H1 on a pro forma basis. Cigarette volumes declined by a modest 0.4% in Q2, with notable support from Turkey and Egypt, and by 1.7% for H1, reflecting a solid category share performance in a resilient category, despite stepped-up pricing. Our smoke-free transformation continues to progress rapidly. Due to the continued impressive performance of IQOS, heated tobacco units comprised 16.4% of our total shipment volume in H1 as compared to 14% in the first half of 2022, despite a resilient cigarette category. Including oral smoke-free products, this would be close to 18%. Powered by IQOS and ZYN, smoke-free products made up 35% of our adjusted net revenues in H1, compared to 30.9% for the same period in 2022. IQOS devices accounted for approximately 4.5% of our H1 inhalable smoke-free net revenues. Focusing now on combustibles, our portfolio delivered strong organic net revenue growth of 7.4% in Q2 and 5.2% in H1. This reflects strong Q2 pricing, with a notable contribution from Indonesia and the Philippines. While we don\u2019t expect the exceptionally strong Q2 pricing of 9.4%, which benefitted from timing factors, to be fully replicated in H2, we now forecast a full-year increase of 7% to 8%. Our cigarette category share grew by 0.7 points in Q2 on a year-over-year basis, including contributions from Duty Free, Egypt, and Turkey, and by 0.1 point in H1, resulting in only modest volume declines. Our leadership in combustibles helps to maximize switching to smoke-free products, and we have fully achieved our ongoing objective of stable category share over the last 18 months, despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization.  The combination of our stable share in combustibles and the continued growth of our leading smoke-free brands, positions us to deliver total market share growth over time. We captured 1.1 points of international cigarette and HTU share in Q2, and 0.5 points in H1, with notable contributions from Turkey and Japan. Impressively, despite increasing competition in many markets, our volume share of the growing heat-not-burn category remains stable at around 75%. This is supported by ongoing ILUMA market launches and increasing focus on our two-tier HTU portfolio, providing adult smokers with an expanding range of innovative and high-quality alternatives to cigarettes. PMI HTUs again strengthened their position as the second largest nicotine brand in markets where IQOS is present, with a sequential share gain in Q2 of 0.2 points to a record 9.2% share. We estimate there were 27.2 million IQOS users as of June 30th. This reflects excellent growth of 1.4 million adult users in Q2, with notable progress in Japan and Europe, in addition to a broad range of other geographies. While fundamentals remain very strong, I remind you that Q3 user growth can often be below the average for the year due to the seasonal factors evident in prior years.  I will now turn to IQOS in the Europe Region, where we are approaching a milestone of 12 million users. This reflects the further roll-out of ILUMA, which is now available to around 70% of IQOS users in the region, and the expansion of our two-tier portfolio. As an illustration of its progress, TEREA is already close to 100% of our HTU in-market sales volumes in the first launch markets of Spain and Switzerland. Our second quarter HTU share increased by 1.6 points year-over-year to 9.0% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume. While sequential share is, as usual, optically affected by the seasonality of the cigarette category, adjusted in-market sales volumes continue to exhibit robust sequential growth, and reached a record high on a four-quarter moving average. This reflects strong year-on-year growth of 20% in Q2, outstripping the 11% growth in HTU shipments, which were affected by some residual effects from the inventory dynamics seen in Q1. We expect robust growth in HTU shipments, adjusted in-market sales, and overall region organic net revenues in the second half.  We continue to be encouraged by the increasing number of European countries adopting multi-year excise tax plans, with clear differentiation of smoke-free products. Over half of EU member states have now passed multi-year plans. Also in the EU, a number of member states are currently transposing the Delegated Directive, withdrawing the heated tobacco product exemption from the flavor ban into national legislations. The ban is scheduled to come into effect on October 23rd, and we will be adjusting our HTU portfolio as required, in line with this transposition. While short-term volatility is possible, we do not expect a significant change in the structural growth of the category.  To give some further color on our continued progress in the region, this slide shows a selection of the latest key city offtake shares. The success of IQOS continues across a diverse range of geographies from Western, Southern, Central, and Eastern Europe, including markets with and without ILUMA. Despite the denominator effects of the combustible category I just mentioned, share results remain very strong. We are very pleased with trends in Rome, showing a sequential step-up to 28% share following the ILUMA launch. Robust progress in London and Munich also bodes well for these two key markets. While the Q2 2022 comparison for share in Vilnius was helped by the popularity of certain bundle offers, the share of over 40% remains impressive, and underlying offtake continues to grow.  In Japan, IQOS ILUMA continues to drive impressive growth momentum. Smoke-free products made up over 75% of our Japan net revenues in H1, clearly showing the path for the broader company. Adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by 3.4 points in Q2 to 26.3%, further strengthening TEREA and SENTIA\u2019s positions as the clear number one and two heat-not-burn brands, despite intensified price competition for mid and low-price offerings. Importantly, adjusted in-market sales volumes again grew sequentially, reaching a record high of 9.3 billion units on a four-quarter moving average, as IQOS outgrew the heat-not-burn category. In addition to this excellent consumer trend, our Q2 shipments to Japan also benefitted from progressively switching back to sea freight during the quarter. In addition to strong IQOS gains in developed countries, we continue to see very promising growth in low and middle-income markets. This slide highlights a selection of Q2 key city offtake shares across markets in Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Notable ongoing successes include Egypt, with Cairo offtake share surpassing 8.5%, and Bulgaria, with offtake share in Sofia exceeding 15%, despite the usual impact of seasonality that I mentioned. We continue to see robust offtake volume growth across these important future markets.  Now moving to Swedish Match, which is meaningfully accelerating our smoke-free growth trajectory. As covered earlier, the business delivered outstanding currency-neutral net revenue growth of 19% in Q2 and 17% in H1. This means that in the first half of the year, Swedish Match has added 70 basis points of currency-neutral growth to our pro forma topline, and 60 basis points to our adjusted OI margin. In the US, ZYN delivered another exceptional quarter, with volume growth of over 50%, reflecting positive momentum across the country. Elsewhere in smoke-free, recent trends of share gains in US moist snuff, as well as category mix headwinds in Scandinavia, broadly continued. The cigar business performed well, with Q2 organic net revenue growth of 16%. This reflects ongoing share gains despite being an early mover on category pricing. I would like to again congratulate and thank all the Swedish Match employees for continuing to deliver terrific results as we thoughtfully integrate our activities, which is progressing very well.  Looking at ZYN\u2019s US performance in more detail, exceptional year-over-year volume growth in cans of 53%, also reflects a 22% sequential increase versus Q1, 2023. This accelerated growth reflects progressive increases in distribution and a broad nationwide step-up in store velocities as the category gains strong traction with adult nicotine users for its convenience and pleasurable experience. This includes California, which implemented a statewide flavor ban in December. While such elevated rates of growth may not continue indefinitely, the structural indicators remain very encouraging. Impressively, ZYN category volume share grew 2.2 points compared to prior year and 1 point sequentially, despite continued discounting from less premium offerings. Retail value share also grew to 76.8%, highlighting its premium positioning and superior brand equity.  Now, let me provide an update on our innovation and expansion plans as we further accelerate our smoke-free transformation. First and foremost, the global roll-out of IQOS ILUMA continues to be a top priority. We launched ILUMA in six markets in Q2, and with HTU manufacturing constraints now normalized, we aim to be present in around 50 markets by the end of the year. The most significant opportunity to drive accelerated growth is in the US We are investing behind ZYN and readying our organizational and commercial capabilities for the launch of IQOS in Q2 next year. As mentioned in today\u2019s release, we are also on track for IQOS ILUMA PMTA and supplemental MRTPA submissions in Q4 2023. Our philosophy on the US remains unchanged. We will seek to accelerate our topline with IQOS and ZYN, supported by disciplined investment and leveraging both our extensive experience in smoke-free products and Swedish Match\u2019s infrastructure and knowledge, while continuing to deliver strong bottom-line growth for PMI. Our pilot city launches for BONDS in the Philippines and Colombia continue to progress well. The learnings from these markets will be integrated as we roll out more broadly, starting next year. The international expansion of nicotine pouches remains a key medium-term opportunity, notably for ZYN as the world\u2019s leading brand. We are now preparing for the launch of - re-launch of ZYN in several markets. In e-vapor, our refocused approach in select markets is progressing with VEEV ONE, our newly designed pod-based system introduced in four markets, and VEEV NOW, our disposable product, in six markets.  Now let me discuss our Wellness and Healthcare segment, starting with its first clinical trial results for our inhalable aspirin product. While it was observed that the experimental product had a rapid onset of effect, which is the key medical advantage sought, there was significant variability in inhaled dose among subjects. The study was therefore deemed unsuccessful, and as a result, product design improvements are required. Our plan was to file this product with the FDA later this year. However, additional time is now required, and the outcome is therefore less certain. In addition, the CDMO business has been facing slower-than-anticipated development, including cost-related challenges. Consequently, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment from our annual assessment, as detailed in today\u2019s release. While these elements will postpone the achievement of our 2025 aspiration to reach over $1 billion of net revenues from Wellness and Healthcare products, they will result in a corresponding decrease in the level of investment in 2024.  Our ambitions to build and monetize our product pipeline are unchanged. As in the early days of developing IQOS, certain headwinds are to be expected, and the 2021 acquisitions in this segment have provided us with unique and enabling R&D capabilities. We remain committed to developing our Wellness & Healthcare business and continue to see attractive mid and long-term growth potential on many fronts such as inhalable drugs, NRT, and consumer wellness products, including non-recreational cannabinoids, in line with applicable regulatory requirements. We also aim to accelerate Vectura\u2019s growth, and will be exploring potential partnerships to enhance its CDMO business. We plan to discuss all these topics, including our plans for IQOS in the US and a full update on our Wellness & Healthcare business at our Investor Day on the 28th of September in Lausanne, Switzerland. Moving now to sustainability. Addressing the product health impact of combustible products by switching adult smokers to smoke-free products, such as IQOS and ZYN, remains our most critical priority. This transformation is at the core of our strategy, driving accelerated growth and returns over time from a more sustainable business. In addition, we remain committed to delivering best-in-class progress in other key sustainability areas. With our extensive agricultural and manufacturing supply chain, human rights are a very important responsibility for our company. We released our first dedicated report on the topic last month, detailing our strategy to promote, respect, and protect human rights, and the progress to date in implementing our human rights commitment. Our performance on human rights is included in the 19 KPIs of our Sustainability Index, which comprises 30% of executive long-term equity compensation, weighted towards our product transformation. Our goal is to conduct comprehensive human rights impact assessments in our 10 highest risk markets by the end of 2025. These help us better understand and address our impacts, and we are making excellent progress, with seven completed to date. Addressing climate change is another priority for us, and I\u2019m pleased to share that PMI was included in Forbes' first ever Net Zero Leaders List, ranking seventh overall for all US public companies, higher than any other consumer products or services company.  To conclude today\u2019s presentation, we delivered a very strong first-half despite a number of headwinds, putting us on track for the third consecutive year of positive volumes and organic net revenue growth of over 7%. The powerful trajectory of our smoke-free business gives us confidence in a strong full year performance, with excellent operating income growth. Outstanding momentum continues for IQOS and ZYN, the world-leading heat-not-burn and oral nicotine brands, and we have exciting plans to further grow oral nicotine pouches in the US and internationally, along with the US commercialization of IQOS next year. Importantly, we remain steadfast in our commitment to generously reward our shareholders, including through our progressive dividend policy. In short, our smoke-free transformation continues to deliver sustainable growth. We look forward to sharing more with you on the next phase of our transformation at our Investor Day on September 28.  Thank you very much, and we are now delighted to answer your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Pamela Kaufman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nPamela Kaufman: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask about your full year guidance. You exceeded your own Q2 guidance by at least $0.13, but did not flow through the EPS to the full-year outlook, even when factoring the greater FX headwind. What's tempering the flow-through of Q2 upside, and how much does this reflect conservatism around the balance of the year versus a more cautious outlook on the second half or higher investments? Thanks.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Pam. When we look at the driver for beating our initial expectation for Q2, I think we can probably make three buckets. One is the outperformance of ZYN versus our expectation, and that's something that we are of course taking into account as we see a better trajectory for ZYN than initially anticipated. Remember that will only contribute to our organic growth on revenue in Q4. But that is of course helping the adjusted EPS growth excluding forex. We also see some cost that has been moved to H2 and that is if you want cause that are we going to see in H2, so it's not a net addition for the year. And then there was, as we said, some better news on a financial cost of course from our debt. There was also some element on tax and of course this one is more uncertain and more difficult to predict for the second part of the year. But I think as always, we are building scenario for the full year. We've been including in a clear way what we see a real change in the trajectory and on which we have visibility for the second half on things where we have postponement of things with good news, but of course we still a lot of uncertainty on H2. Of course, we have to be a bit more cautious when we take them in the scenarios.\nPamela Kaufman: Okay, thanks. And then just on operating margins, you pointed to operating margins closer to the lower end of your initial guidance range of down 50 to 150 basis points for the year. Can you discuss the puts and takes impacting your margin performance in the second half?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Sure. When you look at the margin, really things are happening as expected, I would say. So, after Q1, which was not coming as a surprise to us, we said from now on, we're going to see an improvement of the margin trajectory. We knew that inflation would still be there for the rest of the year, although in the second part of the year, we are going to be facing comparison where inflation was starting to kick in, so that's going to have some impact. But we knew that a number of other headwinds would start to abate, and here I'm talking about the disruption on the supply chain and among other things, things connected with air freight, the cost attached to the launch of ILUMA, and the fact that not everything was optimal. So, we started to see improvement in Q2 as expected, and we're going to continue to see improvement in the rest of the year. And then what we see playing in Q2 that we expect to see playing in the rest of the year are the fundamental positive drivers that we have for our margin. First of all, the fact that IQOS growth is having a positive impact on our margin. We said it in the beginning, we expect a positive contribution on margin evolution for the year from the IQOS business. Remember, we have a higher gross margin rate on our consumable for IQOS. So, as we are growing IQOS, that is having a positive impact. There is no - when it comes to our smokefree business, another driver that is positive for our margin, which is ZYN, and ZYN in the US, which is also accretive to the margin. You don't see it in the organic reporting so far, but it's going to start to kick in in Q4 and we expect to have another nice positive. And then the third element that I think you see of course nicely in Q2 is our pricing power. We see today very clearly on combustible. We have some headwinds that are temporary coming from Germany and Japan on heat-not-burn, but we retained pricing power, which is positive for the long term. And these are good elements. Of course, in front of that we will keep investing and making sure that we are maximizing the growth potential, but that's really what is behind the margin development for the year. Now, on top of it, and I think we've been flying that during this quarter, we have the development of businesses that are coming with lower margin because we are buying to (sub-parties), and that is a different margin dynamic. And also, this business which we called below V1, which is in fact with reduced excise duty in Indonesia, that is coming with lower margin. It's more a technical effect, I would say. And as mentioned, without that we would've been, in fact, in the middle of the bracket that we gave the 50 to 150 negative. And again, this is not reflecting the positive contribution for ZYN. So, I would say as a summary, things are happening as expected and we start to see the fact that we have on the long term some fundamental positive drivers for our margin that I summarized.\nPamela Kaufman: Thank you. That's very helpful.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Vivien Azer with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nVivien Azer: Hi, good morning. I wanted to follow up on the commentary on ZYN, certainly consistent with the very robust trends that we're seeing in the Nielsen scanner data, accelerating growth, strong market share gains. You've spoken in the past about the opportunity to offer some incremental investment for that business unit to expand the sales force, improve distribution and drive velocity. Can you just talk to us about where you are in that assessment time horizon for ZYN, please? Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Sure, Vivien. Yes, ZYN is - I mean, we knew that the brand was great. I think we are seeing something that is above our initial expectation to be very clear for the time being, at the time of the acquisition of Swedish Match. There is clearly a growing awareness of this category. We see a lot of poly usage. So, you have a percentage that is fully converted, but a lot of poly usage. We talk about people discovering that they can enjoy their nicotine in moments where they cannot enjoy, whether they\u2019re combustible cigarettes or other inhalable product. That is certainly playing. I think there is a very positive lifestyle element around the development in the US that is gathering momentum. So, that is, I think, explaining the success of ZYN, that is the icon of the category, and of course, taking today the lion's share of the growth of this nicotine pouch progression in the US. Now, that is very good news of course, because that means that we have a very dynamic business in the US. To be very clear, it's not marginal at the group level. So, you will see, and you already see in the performance, the impact of the ZYN US performance.  So, that's great to have another driver for our smoke-free performance and globally for the financial performance of the company. But it's setting the scene very well for IQOS because on top of what is successful, we're going to be able to build a very efficient commercial engine. You said it increased sales force. We\u2019re in the making of that. It\u2019s happening progressively. It's of course going to help both ZYN and IQOS, but that also goes very well for our capacity to develop IQOS successfully in the future in the US. We don't have a convergence of strength between ZYN and IQOS. So, to be very clear, we haven't been suddenly increasing at that stage by several hundred people to the sales force. It's happening gradually as we build the capacity for IQOS starting Q2 next year. There is other investment that we're doing in our digital capacity and digital commercial engine. Again, just the beginning. So, I don't think it is really today behind the growth that we see behind ZYN, but these are additional strengths and capacity. And again, I think we are very excited about the amazing teams that IQOS and ZYN can be in the future in the US.\nVivien Azer: That's really helpful. Thank you for that. And then just moving to the Wellness and Healthcare segment for my second question, please, understanding some of the challenges around the clinical trial, I was wondering if you could just comment on your aspiration to delever the balance sheet post the Swedish Match transaction versus the potential need for incremental M&A as you think about an ultimate $1 billion revenue target, understanding that you pushed out the date for that. Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes, and I want to be very clear. I mean, the focus is on deleveraging the balance sheet. We are focusing on extracting the great potential that we have in our smoke-free business. I mentioned IQOS and ZYN together. We certainly want to grow VEEV as well. But I think there is so much potential on IQOS and ZYN that it's of course the key focus today. And we are spending our time, energy on maximizing the potential there, and that's going to generate deleveraging. So, the time today is not for us to think about, I would say, a structural move on M&A in other spaces. We are very much focused on optimizing this great potential that we have in our smoke-free business today.\nVivien Azer: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Gaurav Jain with Barclays. Your line is open.\nGaurav Jain: Hi. Good morning. So, I have a question on ZYN in the US. So, the volumes are coming in much ahead of where I think consensus is where we were. We also know that US cigarette volumes have persisted at very weak rates despite easy comps. So, what do you think is the cannibalization rate of ZYN on US cigarettes today? And as you project out IQOS growth over the next seven years, if ZYN's cannibalization is higher than what is thought of, then does it mean that the cigarette universe is smaller, which implies that the IQOS opportunity is smaller?\nEmmanuel Babeau: It\u2019s, Gaurav, an excellent question. I believe - first of all, I'm not going to be able to give a precise answer, as you can imagine. I believe that there is probably some cannibalization for the reason I mentioned. We see behaviors developing of people that probably are aware, combustible user, and they discovered that they can enjoy their nicotine in a different manner, with certainly positive perception on when they can do it and the impact on them. Now, I'm not able to tell you whether this is something very material. So, I don't have any data at that stage. And I'm sure we'll try to elaborate on the ZYN driver on the 28th of September, but as I said, I'm not able to share with you any hard data on how it's materializing. Frankly, I don't think that this is going to be really relevant for IQOS because maybe in a kind of super marginal manner. But here we talk about with IQOS, smokers who want to enjoy when they are still enjoying today combustible cigarette, but different product that is mimicking very closely their pleasure, with clearly personal benefit on their health, but also on their lifestyle. So, I don't see the ZYN moment as something that is going to compete with IQOS in a meaningful manner. So, I think that that's not something that we see as a risk to undermine IQOS potential in the future.\nGaurav Jain: Sure. Thank you. And the second question I have is on this EU heated tobacco flavor ban. And you mentioned that there could be some volatility. Now, the experience in California has been pretty bad for - post the menthol cigarette ban, and that only 70% of the menthol smoker seems to have been retained in the cigarette market. So, like, what is the precedence? Is there any precedence of a flavored heated tobacco ban anywhere which helps you form the view that the impact will be quite minimal?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes, there is, Gaurav. So, I will take two examples, one in Europe when there was the menthol - the flavor ban in May 2020, where it had minimal impact on the combustible business, very, very small. So, that's one illustration. And the other one is actually - because we talk about growing products. The other one here is the ban on flavor in California that impacted ZYN at the end of 2022. And there was a few weeks with a blip on the volume. And then the momentum came back on non-flavored product actually with even more intensity and blip has been swallowed, and you don't see today any impact of this ban. So, I think here you have two element experiences that show that this is having minimum impact. And again, we're comparing in California with growing a category, which maybe is more appropriate, but referring to combustible in Europe in May 2020, the impact was de minimis.\nGaurav Jain: Okay, sure. Thank you so much.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nBonnie Herzog: All right, thank you. Hi, Emmanuel. I wanted to circle back to your guidance with just maybe a quick follow-on question. Your full-year guidance implies, I guess, more riding on Q4. So, just hoping you could help us understand maybe your level of conviction and or visibility that your business really will strengthen so much later this year. And then, I know it\u2019s early, and I don't expect you to guide next year, but is there anything we should think about that you\u2019re investing in this year that really could position you for even greater growth next year and beyond?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes. So, Bonnie, trying to be back on H2, I think you see it already in Q2. I mean, the momentum behind IQOS is there. We see it. We estimate 1.4 million user growth in Q2. That's an excellent number. We see in-market sales going up. We know that there is seasonality, but it doesn't mean that the consumer offtake is going to decrease. There is more launch of ILUMA and some of them that happened in the end of H1 that is going to contribute as well in the second part of the year. So, we see very robust momentum there. We see the work that we've been doing and as we said, the highest intensity of price increase has happened in Q2, is going to be lower in H2. And we've been defending our market share well in a market that is resilient. And we may discuss why CC is so resilient, but the fact is that combustible is proving to be resilient in many geographies. And then there is a ZYN moment, clearly a ZYN momentum, which we're not saying we're going to keep growing at 50%, of course, but clearly we expect momentum to continue super nicely on ZYN and starting Q4 that will also contribute to the organic growth. But in any case, it's going to fully contribute to adjusted EPS growth, excluding forex. So, all that give us the confidence that we are set for a very, very good and very strong H2 in terms of performance. Now, when we look towards 2024, we believe that the growth drivers are going to stay the same. So, IQOS, with of course the launch in Q2 in the US, but let's be clear, it's going to be the beginning. So, it's not going to immediately have a huge impact. It's going to be a ramp up, as we explained, but there will be a number of countries where ILUMA will be fully delivering. Look at Japan. That's quite interesting what happened in Japan. In fact, we've seen kind of another acceleration on market share and volume one year after the launch of ILUMA. So, it's not as if the old positive impact was happening in the first weeks. I would say takes some time to create the awareness, the understanding, and the positive appreciation. And then we're going to have ZYN and nicotine pouches. ZYN, first of all, starting in the US, but a number of exciting launch outside the US as well. So, that is boding well for 2024, but of course, it's premature to talk about \u201924, and we'll give guidance in due course.\nBonnie Herzog: Okay. That all makes sense and helpful. And then I just for my second question, I was hoping for some more color on Japan, and it looks like your shipment volume was really strong in the quarter and then your market shares increased nicely. So, could you talk through key drivers of this? And then I believe BAT is cutting their prices on glo Hyper starting in August. So, could you talk through the current competitive environment and then maybe how you expect it might change in light of these actions, as well as how you may need to respond, if at all. Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Sure, Bonnie. So, Japan, of course, is a matter of great satisfaction. I was alluding to it, the fact that one year after the launch of ILUMA, we see a further acceleration of our market share. We are now above 26%. And as I said, that shows that the brand keeps doing inroads, converting more people, making a big difference versus competition. And we are - actually, we've seen our capture share of the growth of the category that continue to grow increasing. We have a two-tier strategy between TEREA and SENTIA that is proving to be very efficient. So, we have the premium range, TEREA, with a lot of innovation, great flavor experience. And then we have SENTIA, which is of course at the lower level in term of positioning. But with this two, I would say range, we managed to really reach the broadest possible member of ILUMA user, and that's clearly showing some great success. We are back in Japan to see freight progressively. So, that was expected. Last year, the shipments were lower than the consumer uptake. And this year, that is of course not - we're going back to the normal situation. That was absolutely planned. And we see indeed competition while trying to fight. This is a category that keeps having a lot of traction and gaining share. They are fighting to keep growing when ILUMA is clearly doing well. And so far, they believe that their way forward is to come with cheaper consumable. That's of course their decision. I won't comment on that. It's clear that despite that, we managed to grow the share. But it's good to see that there is a clear growing commitment from the whole industry behind the category in Japan.\nBonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you again.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Matt Smith with Stifel. Your line is open.\nMatt Smith: Hi, thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the pacing of the rollout of ILUMA to 50 markets from the 23 markets where it's available today. Do you expect that to be fairly evenly spread across the second half? And could you talk about the rollout or the expansion, the impact on your operating margin in the second half, as well as your gross margin?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes, Matt. So, there will be a progressive difficult for me - I mean, there will be events in Q3 and Q4 of launch of ILUMA in a number of countries. It\u2019s difficult for me to tell you whether it even spread, because I would've probably to do that depending on the size of each market, but it's going to be relatively well spread. Let\u2019s be clear. We have already two third of the IQOS volume that are exposed or benefit from ILUMA\u2019s presence. So, it's not marginal, but a big part of it has already been done. And as we said, at the beginning of ILUMA, we were not fully optimized on the product, on the productivity. It doesn't mean that everything will be done at the end of the year, but we expect to certainly see an acceleration of productivity, reduction in the weight in the second part of the year, and that will have a positive impact on margin evolution, absolutely in line with what I explained a number of headwinds that are receding in line with expectation. But that's really what you can expect for ILUMA in the second part of the year.\nMatt Smith: That you for that. And if I could ask just a follow-up question on the combustible performance. It's been stronger in terms of both volume and organic revenue contribution, and you made a couple of comments about the demand environment holding up better than your expectation relative to the elevated pricing. Can you talk about the factors that are allowing the consumers to hold up elasticity better than your expectations? Do you expect that to continue now that you're going to lap some pricing action?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Look, so far, I think that we've seen that pricing, it doesn't mean that the consumer is going away. I'm not able to tell you how it's going to further evolve in the future. I think what we see globally on the combustible market is first of all, a few markets where, because of the demographic, we see the consumption of combustible going up. I could certainly mention India, probably Egypt, Turkey, probably Vietnam, even if it's not a big market for us, where we see combustible business going up. The resilience is also coming from a number of markets where there is a ban on smoke-free products. So, of course, that is to some extent protecting the combustible business. As you know, that\u2019s clearly not something that we like. We think that it's a big mistake, but that is probably providing some resilience to the category overall. So, that would be my analogy on combustible.\nMatt Smith: Thank you for that, Emmanuel. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Owen Bennett with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nOwen Bennett: Afternoon, Emmanuel. Hope you are well. So, related to heated competitive dynamics, so all three of your major tobacco peers now appear to be in a better spot, at least versus the past with regard to product offerings at least, and money they're investing into this. I was just wondering if you could comment on IQOS trends in some of the more competitive heated markets where all three of your major peers now have a presence. So, like (indiscernible) for example. So, how is IQOS share holding or ILUMA having less traction in these markets than others? Are you seeing trial of other brands and consumers coming back to IQOS? Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Sure, Owen. Actually, you may have seen that our share of the category has remained stable in Q2 at around 75%. So, it shows that indeed there is increased competition, but the quality of IQOS and notably ILUMA, but not just ILUMA, the overall IQOS proposition, is allowing us to, even if we're more premium, to maintain our share of the category, which is very good news. Here, I'm talking about volume. You can imagine in term of value, that is even higher. Now, let's be clear. Since the beginning, we knew, and I can say we were hoping for the whole industry to embrace heat-not-burn as the category of the future for inhalable nicotine product. And it's great to see a growing commitment from all the player behind that. So, no doubt that they will come with innovation. Our self, as you can imagine, we're going to continue to innovate as well. And we will see certainly innovation and maybe new things coming in the future. Now, after six, seven, almost eight years of launch of IQOS, I think in term of franchise, in term of impact, in term of strength, in term of brand power, I think we are really second to none. And we made a clear gap and differential. And I think that this is exactly what we did with Marlboro in the past, which Marlboro was a superior product and recognized for the brand that was unique. But on top of that, we managed to create a unique brand that was extremely appealing. And I think with IQOS, that's what we are repeating today. So IQOS products are clearly better recognized as such. It's a different customer experience, but then the IQOS brand is also iconic, and people are seeing that as part of lifestyle and product they want to associate themselves with, which is a recipe for long-term success.\nOwen Bennett: Cool. Thank you, sir. I appreciate it.\nOperator: And we'll take our final question from Jared Dinges with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJared Dinges: Yes. Hi guys. So, you talked about the ability to use sea freight finally to supply Japan as you progress throughout Q2. Would you be able to confirm that you're no longer capacity-constrained on the TEREA sticks?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes. So, we can confirm that for the market where we've been launching today, we have no constraint, and therefore that's the reason why we've been able to move to sea freight. Now, there is still a ramp-up for the remaining markets that do not have ILUMA today. And this ramp-up is of course, accompanying the growing capacity. So, it doesn't mean that today we could serve on the 1st of July 100% of all the market, IQOS market with I ILUMA consumable, but we have no longer pressure restriction and the fact that we are back to sea freight, and we have a plan to accompany the growth of the remaining markets in the coming months.\nJared Dinges: Got it. And maybe just to follow up on that, so you guys did call out Europe with IQOS, saw some further negative inventory move in Q2. Should we expect that to reverse in H2? Because actually it's been - on the whole, in H1 it's been somewhat sizable, the negative inventory.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes. In fact, that\u2019s - sure. In fact, that's - Japan was finishing with lower shipment volume than consumer offtake in 2022. That has been reversing in 2023. And Europe went the other way round. Remember, we had too low because of uncertainty on the availability of product and energy supply in the manufacturing site. And that was expected, but the catchup has been happening mostly in Q1, but still a little bit in Q2. And now we expect to move to normal pattern of shipment versus consumer offtake or in-market sales. And therefore, we expect to have a strong H2, both in term of shipment progression and in-market sales in Europe, back to normal. \nJared Dinges: That's clear. And if I can just follow up just one last one. On Russia, given the news last week or this week, just can you give an update on if that business is fully ringfenced at this point?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Look, on Russia, we have nothing new to say. We've been explaining in the past communication that the situation was complex. There is no new element. I'm not going to comment on the situation of a company that I know nothing about. And we have nothing new to report on Russia at this stage. \nJared Dinges: Got it. Maybe just in terms of supply, like Russia's not supplying any neighboring markets at this point, right? \nEmmanuel Babeau: Well, we are, as you can imagine, complying with all regulation, restriction, sanction today, and we are obviously fully compliant. \nJared Dinges: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: It appears we have no further questions on the line at this time. I will turn the program back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.\nJames Bushnell: Thank you. That concludes our call today. Thank you again for joining us. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations team. Have a great day.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Talk to you soon. Thank you. Bye.\nOperator: This does conclude today\u2019s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Emmanuel Babeau",
            "content": "Thank you, James, and welcome everyone. Our business delivered outstanding performance in the second quarter of 2023, exceeding our expectations to reach a record high quarterly adjusted diluted EPS of $1.60. This was driven by impressive ZYN and IQOS growth, coupled with strong combustible results. We delivered total cigarette and HTU shipment volume growth of 3.3%, putting us well on track for our third consecutive year of positive volumes. This excellent result underpinned double-digit organic topline growth and high-teens currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth. We also expanded our leadership in smoke-free products in the period. Firstly, IQOS' strong momentum continued, with adjusted in-market sales volumes, led by plus 16%, and shipments up by plus 27%. This reflects very good user growth of plus 1.4 million in the quarter and continued strong traction across the world. This is increasingly driven by IQOS ILUMA, which is now available in 23 markets, representing around two thirds of our IQOS business by volume. Secondly, and now two full quarters after the Swedish Match acquisition, ZYN is delivering an exceptional acceleration to our smoke-free business. US volumes grew by over plus 50%, including a notable step-up in June. We are delighted with this performance. Our combustible business also delivered better-than-expected results with over plus 7% organic net revenue growth after a very robust quarter for pricing and resilient volumes. This was a key contributor to the strong plus 7% organic operating income growth, with a plus 210 basis points sequential improvement in our adjusted operating income margin.  Turning to the headline numbers, positive volumes supported very strong organic topline growth of plus 10.5%, with continued excellent IQOS momentum and a further acceleration in combustible pricing. This does not include the remarkable plus 19% pro forma ex-currency topline growth of Swedish Match, led by ZYN, with combined pro forma ex-currency net revenues increasing by plus 11.1%. Our total reported currency-neutral net revenues grew by plus 19%. Our organic net revenue per unit grew by plus 7.0%, driven by the increasing proportion of IQOS HTUs in our sales mix and combustible pricing. Due to these positive factors, adjusted operating income grew by a very robust plus 7% organically despite continued inflationary headwinds. This excludes the tremendous growth of ZYN, and starting in Q4, our organic results will include Swedish Match. Adjusted OI margins improved 210 basis points sequentially, and while still organically lower year-on-year by 140 basis points, this better-than-expected performance was notably supported by combustible strength and favorable timing of certain costs. We also increased our participation in the below Tier 1 segment in Indonesia, which now represents close to 40% of its industry volumes, and is slightly dilutive to our margins. This organic delivery, including the favorable timing of costs, combined with exceptional June ZYN volumes, and a lower tax rate, allowed us to outperform our most recent Q2 forecast. We delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $1.60, representing 16.9% growth, excluding an unfavorable currency impact of $0.13, notably due to the Japanese yen.  While the first quarter of the year contained some exceptional headwinds and distortions due to timing and comparison effects, our business delivered a strong first half, including volume growth of 1.1%. Organic net revenues grew by 6.8%, with Swedish Match's excellent ex-currency pro forma net revenue growth of 17% for H1, demonstrating its growth accretion to our business. Combined pro forma currency-neutral net revenues increased by around 7.5%.  Following peak margin headwinds and a notable operating income decline in the first quarter, the strong improvement in Q2 narrowed the H1 organic decline to minus 2%. As in Q2, this excludes Swedish Match, which delivered an excellent profit performance and made a significant contribution to our adjusted OI margins. We expect continued strong reported and organic operating income growth in the second half. Despite these headwinds, we delivered 5.9% growth in currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS to $2.98 in H1, providing a strong platform for the second half of 2023 and beyond.  Let me now walk through the mechanics of our Q2 net revenues. While not included in our reported shipment volume growth of 3.3%, Swedish Match's smoke-free volumes grew by 15%, providing impressive accretion to our overall growth profile. Combustible and HTU pricing contributed plus 6 points of growth. This primarily reflects combustible strength, partly benefitting from timing effects. As in Q1, HTU pricing was impacted in Japan and Germany by the annualization of 2022 excise tax increases, and in the case of Japan, the transition to ILUMA. These factors will have less impact in the second half as annualization recedes. We also continue to expect greater visibility on the likely outcome of the court ruling related to the German tax surcharge toward the end of the year. The increasing proportion of HTUs in our business again contributed positively, reflecting higher net revenue per unit, partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix. The positive mix impact of HTUs, overall volume growth, and pricing, are powerful drivers of our transformation and growth.  Let's now turn to gross margins. While the year-on-year trajectory remained negative, we saw improvement versus the first quarter, driven by strong growth fundamentals. Indeed, we achieved sequential improvement of 1.2 percentage points despite increased inflationary pressures, as topline growth accelerated and supply chain disruptions and ILUMA-related factors started to dissipate in the quarter. In addition, cost phasing and the geographic mix of inventory movements, notably for HTUs in Europe, increasingly normalized after an adversely affected Q1. Our IQOS business contributed positively to our gross margin in Q2, and we expect this to continue, partly mitigating combustibles. We expect further improvement in our year-on-year gross margin trajectory in H2 as headwinds continue to subside, ZYN's outstanding growth continues, and the underlying drivers of our transformation accelerate. As expected, SG&A growth was much closer to net revenue growth in Q2, and at a more normalized growth rate with regard to our full year expectations. Indeed, with such a strong topline in Q2, SG&A costs were lower as a percentage of net revenues. While we continue to invest in IQOS and ZYN, our successful cost efficiency programs continue to deliver, helping to finance growth investments and mitigate inflation, which remains a headwind. With $1.9 billion of gross savings realized to date, including $820 million from SG&A, we are on track to achieve our 2021-23 $2 billion target ahead of plan. Turning now to the 2023 outlook, we are raising our currency-neutral top and bottom-line growth forecasts. We aim to be a growth company starting with volumes. In 2023, we expect to grow total volumes for the third year in a row, even before factoring in the excellent progress of Swedish Match's portfolio. As part of this growth, we are reiterating our targeted HTU shipment range of $125 billion to $132 billion, while we expect a cigarette volume decline of 1.5% to 2.5%. We are increasing our organic net revenue growth forecast to 7.5% to 8.5%, reflecting the continued momentum of IQOS, the resilience of our combustible business, and the ongoing excellent growth of ZYN, which we expect to contribute positively in Q4. We expect strong organic operating income growth in the remainder of the year to support H2 margin expansion despite the headwinds previously mentioned and certain technical impacts. These relate to the increased use of third-party manufacturing in a few markets, such as Indonesia and Ukraine, and the related growth of the below Tier 1 segment in Indonesia I already mentioned. The full year estimated impact of these factors is around 40 basis points on our adjusted OI margin, and without this impact, we would expect to be broadly in the middle of our forecast organic margin range. On top of this organic evolution, we expect Swedish Match to add around 50 basis points of accretion.  Our strong topline and OI outlook allows us to raise our forecast for currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth to 8% to 9.5%. This translates to a revised range of $6.13 to $6.22, including $0.33 from unfavorable currency at prevailing exchange rates, notably due to the Japanese yen and Russian ruble. This forecast continues to assume around $150 million for incremental investments in the US, and our Wellness and Healthcare business. It also assumes around $1.2 billion in net finance costs, which includes higher interest on variable debt, partly offset by better returns on cash deposits. As previously mentioned, our forecasts do not assume any contribution from a potential favorable ruling on the Germany tax surcharge.  Focusing on the second half in more detail, we expect strong performance on all key metrics as smoke-free products deliver an increasingly positive impact. In Q3, we forecast high single-digit organic topline growth, with HTU shipments of 31 billion to 33 billion units, and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.60 to $1.65, including $0.06 of unfavorable currency at prevailing exchange rates. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect notably strong reported and organic OI growth as certain inflationary impacts are annualized, and we increasingly benefit from an optimized ILUMA supply chain and consumables. As I mentioned, Swedish Match will also be included in our organic figures during the quarter. The exceptional growth of ZYN is clearly margin-accretive, as visible in our adjusted H1 figures.  Turning back to our results, our total shipment volumes increased by 3.3% for Q2, and 1.1% year-to-date. HTU shipment volumes grew by 26.6% in Q2 to reach 31.4 billion units, notably driven by continued strong performance in Europe and Japan. In addition to fundamental strength, HTU shipments to Japan were boosted in Q2 by around 2 billion units as we increased sea freight, with corresponding increases in inventory levels. As I mentioned earlier, total PMI adjusted in-market sales volumes of HTUs increased by 16% in Q2, continuing the excellent trend seen in Q1. H1 shipment volumes grew by 18.5%. Notably, this does not include the excellent growth prospects of oral nicotine, for which shipment volumes grew by 14% in Q2 and 12% in H1 on a pro forma basis. Cigarette volumes declined by a modest 0.4% in Q2, with notable support from Turkey and Egypt, and by 1.7% for H1, reflecting a solid category share performance in a resilient category, despite stepped-up pricing. Our smoke-free transformation continues to progress rapidly. Due to the continued impressive performance of IQOS, heated tobacco units comprised 16.4% of our total shipment volume in H1 as compared to 14% in the first half of 2022, despite a resilient cigarette category. Including oral smoke-free products, this would be close to 18%. Powered by IQOS and ZYN, smoke-free products made up 35% of our adjusted net revenues in H1, compared to 30.9% for the same period in 2022. IQOS devices accounted for approximately 4.5% of our H1 inhalable smoke-free net revenues. Focusing now on combustibles, our portfolio delivered strong organic net revenue growth of 7.4% in Q2 and 5.2% in H1. This reflects strong Q2 pricing, with a notable contribution from Indonesia and the Philippines. While we don't expect the exceptionally strong Q2 pricing of 9.4%, which benefitted from timing factors, to be fully replicated in H2, we now forecast a full-year increase of 7% to 8%. Our cigarette category share grew by 0.7 points in Q2 on a year-over-year basis, including contributions from Duty Free, Egypt, and Turkey, and by 0.1 point in H1, resulting in only modest volume declines. Our leadership in combustibles helps to maximize switching to smoke-free products, and we have fully achieved our ongoing objective of stable category share over the last 18 months, despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization.  The combination of our stable share in combustibles and the continued growth of our leading smoke-free brands, positions us to deliver total market share growth over time. We captured 1.1 points of international cigarette and HTU share in Q2, and 0.5 points in H1, with notable contributions from Turkey and Japan. Impressively, despite increasing competition in many markets, our volume share of the growing heat-not-burn category remains stable at around 75%. This is supported by ongoing ILUMA market launches and increasing focus on our two-tier HTU portfolio, providing adult smokers with an expanding range of innovative and high-quality alternatives to cigarettes. PMI HTUs again strengthened their position as the second largest nicotine brand in markets where IQOS is present, with a sequential share gain in Q2 of 0.2 points to a record 9.2% share. We estimate there were 27.2 million IQOS users as of June 30th. This reflects excellent growth of 1.4 million adult users in Q2, with notable progress in Japan and Europe, in addition to a broad range of other geographies. While fundamentals remain very strong, I remind you that Q3 user growth can often be below the average for the year due to the seasonal factors evident in prior years.  I will now turn to IQOS in the Europe Region, where we are approaching a milestone of 12 million users. This reflects the further roll-out of ILUMA, which is now available to around 70% of IQOS users in the region, and the expansion of our two-tier portfolio. As an illustration of its progress, TEREA is already close to 100% of our HTU in-market sales volumes in the first launch markets of Spain and Switzerland. Our second quarter HTU share increased by 1.6 points year-over-year to 9.0% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume. While sequential share is, as usual, optically affected by the seasonality of the cigarette category, adjusted in-market sales volumes continue to exhibit robust sequential growth, and reached a record high on a four-quarter moving average. This reflects strong year-on-year growth of 20% in Q2, outstripping the 11% growth in HTU shipments, which were affected by some residual effects from the inventory dynamics seen in Q1. We expect robust growth in HTU shipments, adjusted in-market sales, and overall region organic net revenues in the second half.  We continue to be encouraged by the increasing number of European countries adopting multi-year excise tax plans, with clear differentiation of smoke-free products. Over half of EU member states have now passed multi-year plans. Also in the EU, a number of member states are currently transposing the Delegated Directive, withdrawing the heated tobacco product exemption from the flavor ban into national legislations. The ban is scheduled to come into effect on October 23rd, and we will be adjusting our HTU portfolio as required, in line with this transposition. While short-term volatility is possible, we do not expect a significant change in the structural growth of the category.  To give some further color on our continued progress in the region, this slide shows a selection of the latest key city offtake shares. The success of IQOS continues across a diverse range of geographies from Western, Southern, Central, and Eastern Europe, including markets with and without ILUMA. Despite the denominator effects of the combustible category I just mentioned, share results remain very strong. We are very pleased with trends in Rome, showing a sequential step-up to 28% share following the ILUMA launch. Robust progress in London and Munich also bodes well for these two key markets. While the Q2 2022 comparison for share in Vilnius was helped by the popularity of certain bundle offers, the share of over 40% remains impressive, and underlying offtake continues to grow.  In Japan, IQOS ILUMA continues to drive impressive growth momentum. Smoke-free products made up over 75% of our Japan net revenues in H1, clearly showing the path for the broader company. Adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by 3.4 points in Q2 to 26.3%, further strengthening TEREA and SENTIA's positions as the clear number one and two heat-not-burn brands, despite intensified price competition for mid and low-price offerings. Importantly, adjusted in-market sales volumes again grew sequentially, reaching a record high of 9.3 billion units on a four-quarter moving average, as IQOS outgrew the heat-not-burn category. In addition to this excellent consumer trend, our Q2 shipments to Japan also benefitted from progressively switching back to sea freight during the quarter. In addition to strong IQOS gains in developed countries, we continue to see very promising growth in low and middle-income markets. This slide highlights a selection of Q2 key city offtake shares across markets in Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Notable ongoing successes include Egypt, with Cairo offtake share surpassing 8.5%, and Bulgaria, with offtake share in Sofia exceeding 15%, despite the usual impact of seasonality that I mentioned. We continue to see robust offtake volume growth across these important future markets.  Now moving to Swedish Match, which is meaningfully accelerating our smoke-free growth trajectory. As covered earlier, the business delivered outstanding currency-neutral net revenue growth of 19% in Q2 and 17% in H1. This means that in the first half of the year, Swedish Match has added 70 basis points of currency-neutral growth to our pro forma topline, and 60 basis points to our adjusted OI margin. In the US, ZYN delivered another exceptional quarter, with volume growth of over 50%, reflecting positive momentum across the country. Elsewhere in smoke-free, recent trends of share gains in US moist snuff, as well as category mix headwinds in Scandinavia, broadly continued. The cigar business performed well, with Q2 organic net revenue growth of 16%. This reflects ongoing share gains despite being an early mover on category pricing. I would like to again congratulate and thank all the Swedish Match employees for continuing to deliver terrific results as we thoughtfully integrate our activities, which is progressing very well.  Looking at ZYN's US performance in more detail, exceptional year-over-year volume growth in cans of 53%, also reflects a 22% sequential increase versus Q1, 2023. This accelerated growth reflects progressive increases in distribution and a broad nationwide step-up in store velocities as the category gains strong traction with adult nicotine users for its convenience and pleasurable experience. This includes California, which implemented a statewide flavor ban in December. While such elevated rates of growth may not continue indefinitely, the structural indicators remain very encouraging. Impressively, ZYN category volume share grew 2.2 points compared to prior year and 1 point sequentially, despite continued discounting from less premium offerings. Retail value share also grew to 76.8%, highlighting its premium positioning and superior brand equity.  Now, let me provide an update on our innovation and expansion plans as we further accelerate our smoke-free transformation. First and foremost, the global roll-out of IQOS ILUMA continues to be a top priority. We launched ILUMA in six markets in Q2, and with HTU manufacturing constraints now normalized, we aim to be present in around 50 markets by the end of the year. The most significant opportunity to drive accelerated growth is in the US We are investing behind ZYN and readying our organizational and commercial capabilities for the launch of IQOS in Q2 next year. As mentioned in today's release, we are also on track for IQOS ILUMA PMTA and supplemental MRTPA submissions in Q4 2023. Our philosophy on the US remains unchanged. We will seek to accelerate our topline with IQOS and ZYN, supported by disciplined investment and leveraging both our extensive experience in smoke-free products and Swedish Match's infrastructure and knowledge, while continuing to deliver strong bottom-line growth for PMI. Our pilot city launches for BONDS in the Philippines and Colombia continue to progress well. The learnings from these markets will be integrated as we roll out more broadly, starting next year. The international expansion of nicotine pouches remains a key medium-term opportunity, notably for ZYN as the world's leading brand. We are now preparing for the launch of - re-launch of ZYN in several markets. In e-vapor, our refocused approach in select markets is progressing with VEEV ONE, our newly designed pod-based system introduced in four markets, and VEEV NOW, our disposable product, in six markets.  Now let me discuss our Wellness and Healthcare segment, starting with its first clinical trial results for our inhalable aspirin product. While it was observed that the experimental product had a rapid onset of effect, which is the key medical advantage sought, there was significant variability in inhaled dose among subjects. The study was therefore deemed unsuccessful, and as a result, product design improvements are required. Our plan was to file this product with the FDA later this year. However, additional time is now required, and the outcome is therefore less certain. In addition, the CDMO business has been facing slower-than-anticipated development, including cost-related challenges. Consequently, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment from our annual assessment, as detailed in today's release. While these elements will postpone the achievement of our 2025 aspiration to reach over $1 billion of net revenues from Wellness and Healthcare products, they will result in a corresponding decrease in the level of investment in 2024.  Our ambitions to build and monetize our product pipeline are unchanged. As in the early days of developing IQOS, certain headwinds are to be expected, and the 2021 acquisitions in this segment have provided us with unique and enabling R&D capabilities. We remain committed to developing our Wellness & Healthcare business and continue to see attractive mid and long-term growth potential on many fronts such as inhalable drugs, NRT, and consumer wellness products, including non-recreational cannabinoids, in line with applicable regulatory requirements. We also aim to accelerate Vectura's growth, and will be exploring potential partnerships to enhance its CDMO business. We plan to discuss all these topics, including our plans for IQOS in the US and a full update on our Wellness & Healthcare business at our Investor Day on the 28th of September in Lausanne, Switzerland. Moving now to sustainability. Addressing the product health impact of combustible products by switching adult smokers to smoke-free products, such as IQOS and ZYN, remains our most critical priority. This transformation is at the core of our strategy, driving accelerated growth and returns over time from a more sustainable business. In addition, we remain committed to delivering best-in-class progress in other key sustainability areas. With our extensive agricultural and manufacturing supply chain, human rights are a very important responsibility for our company. We released our first dedicated report on the topic last month, detailing our strategy to promote, respect, and protect human rights, and the progress to date in implementing our human rights commitment. Our performance on human rights is included in the 19 KPIs of our Sustainability Index, which comprises 30% of executive long-term equity compensation, weighted towards our product transformation. Our goal is to conduct comprehensive human rights impact assessments in our 10 highest risk markets by the end of 2025. These help us better understand and address our impacts, and we are making excellent progress, with seven completed to date. Addressing climate change is another priority for us, and I'm pleased to share that PMI was included in Forbes' first ever Net Zero Leaders List, ranking seventh overall for all US public companies, higher than any other consumer products or services company.  To conclude today's presentation, we delivered a very strong first-half despite a number of headwinds, putting us on track for the third consecutive year of positive volumes and organic net revenue growth of over 7%. The powerful trajectory of our smoke-free business gives us confidence in a strong full year performance, with excellent operating income growth. Outstanding momentum continues for IQOS and ZYN, the world-leading heat-not-burn and oral nicotine brands, and we have exciting plans to further grow oral nicotine pouches in the US and internationally, along with the US commercialization of IQOS next year. Importantly, we remain steadfast in our commitment to generously reward our shareholders, including through our progressive dividend policy. In short, our smoke-free transformation continues to deliver sustainable growth. We look forward to sharing more with you on the next phase of our transformation at our Investor Day on September 28.  Thank you very much, and we are now delighted to answer your questions. Thank you, Pam. When we look at the driver for beating our initial expectation for Q2, I think we can probably make three buckets. One is the outperformance of ZYN versus our expectation, and that's something that we are of course taking into account as we see a better trajectory for ZYN than initially anticipated. Remember that will only contribute to our organic growth on revenue in Q4. But that is of course helping the adjusted EPS growth excluding forex. We also see some cost that has been moved to H2 and that is if you want cause that are we going to see in H2, so it's not a net addition for the year. And then there was, as we said, some better news on a financial cost of course from our debt. There was also some element on tax and of course this one is more uncertain and more difficult to predict for the second part of the year. But I think as always, we are building scenario for the full year. We've been including in a clear way what we see a real change in the trajectory and on which we have visibility for the second half on things where we have postponement of things with good news, but of course we still a lot of uncertainty on H2. Of course, we have to be a bit more cautious when we take them in the scenarios. Sure. When you look at the margin, really things are happening as expected, I would say. So, after Q1, which was not coming as a surprise to us, we said from now on, we're going to see an improvement of the margin trajectory. We knew that inflation would still be there for the rest of the year, although in the second part of the year, we are going to be facing comparison where inflation was starting to kick in, so that's going to have some impact. But we knew that a number of other headwinds would start to abate, and here I'm talking about the disruption on the supply chain and among other things, things connected with air freight, the cost attached to the launch of ILUMA, and the fact that not everything was optimal. So, we started to see improvement in Q2 as expected, and we're going to continue to see improvement in the rest of the year. And then what we see playing in Q2 that we expect to see playing in the rest of the year are the fundamental positive drivers that we have for our margin. First of all, the fact that IQOS growth is having a positive impact on our margin. We said it in the beginning, we expect a positive contribution on margin evolution for the year from the IQOS business. Remember, we have a higher gross margin rate on our consumable for IQOS. So, as we are growing IQOS, that is having a positive impact. There is no - when it comes to our smokefree business, another driver that is positive for our margin, which is ZYN, and ZYN in the US, which is also accretive to the margin. You don't see it in the organic reporting so far, but it's going to start to kick in in Q4 and we expect to have another nice positive. And then the third element that I think you see of course nicely in Q2 is our pricing power. We see today very clearly on combustible. We have some headwinds that are temporary coming from Germany and Japan on heat-not-burn, but we retained pricing power, which is positive for the long term. And these are good elements. Of course, in front of that we will keep investing and making sure that we are maximizing the growth potential, but that's really what is behind the margin development for the year. Now, on top of it, and I think we've been flying that during this quarter, we have the development of businesses that are coming with lower margin because we are buying to (sub-parties), and that is a different margin dynamic. And also, this business which we called below V1, which is in fact with reduced excise duty in Indonesia, that is coming with lower margin. It's more a technical effect, I would say. And as mentioned, without that we would've been, in fact, in the middle of the bracket that we gave the 50 to 150 negative. And again, this is not reflecting the positive contribution for ZYN. So, I would say as a summary, things are happening as expected and we start to see the fact that we have on the long term some fundamental positive drivers for our margin that I summarized. Sure, Vivien. Yes, ZYN is - I mean, we knew that the brand was great. I think we are seeing something that is above our initial expectation to be very clear for the time being, at the time of the acquisition of Swedish Match. There is clearly a growing awareness of this category. We see a lot of poly usage. So, you have a percentage that is fully converted, but a lot of poly usage. We talk about people discovering that they can enjoy their nicotine in moments where they cannot enjoy, whether they're combustible cigarettes or other inhalable product. That is certainly playing. I think there is a very positive lifestyle element around the development in the US that is gathering momentum. So, that is, I think, explaining the success of ZYN, that is the icon of the category, and of course, taking today the lion's share of the growth of this nicotine pouch progression in the US. Now, that is very good news of course, because that means that we have a very dynamic business in the US. To be very clear, it's not marginal at the group level. So, you will see, and you already see in the performance, the impact of the ZYN US performance.  So, that's great to have another driver for our smoke-free performance and globally for the financial performance of the company. But it's setting the scene very well for IQOS because on top of what is successful, we're going to be able to build a very efficient commercial engine. You said it increased sales force. We're in the making of that. It's happening progressively. It's of course going to help both ZYN and IQOS, but that also goes very well for our capacity to develop IQOS successfully in the future in the US. We don't have a convergence of strength between ZYN and IQOS. So, to be very clear, we haven't been suddenly increasing at that stage by several hundred people to the sales force. It's happening gradually as we build the capacity for IQOS starting Q2 next year. There is other investment that we're doing in our digital capacity and digital commercial engine. Again, just the beginning. So, I don't think it is really today behind the growth that we see behind ZYN, but these are additional strengths and capacity. And again, I think we are very excited about the amazing teams that IQOS and ZYN can be in the future in the US. Yes, and I want to be very clear. I mean, the focus is on deleveraging the balance sheet. We are focusing on extracting the great potential that we have in our smoke-free business. I mentioned IQOS and ZYN together. We certainly want to grow VEEV as well. But I think there is so much potential on IQOS and ZYN that it's of course the key focus today. And we are spending our time, energy on maximizing the potential there, and that's going to generate deleveraging. So, the time today is not for us to think about, I would say, a structural move on M&A in other spaces. We are very much focused on optimizing this great potential that we have in our smoke-free business today. It's, Gaurav, an excellent question. I believe - first of all, I'm not going to be able to give a precise answer, as you can imagine. I believe that there is probably some cannibalization for the reason I mentioned. We see behaviors developing of people that probably are aware, combustible user, and they discovered that they can enjoy their nicotine in a different manner, with certainly positive perception on when they can do it and the impact on them. Now, I'm not able to tell you whether this is something very material. So, I don't have any data at that stage. And I'm sure we'll try to elaborate on the ZYN driver on the 28th of September, but as I said, I'm not able to share with you any hard data on how it's materializing. Frankly, I don't think that this is going to be really relevant for IQOS because maybe in a kind of super marginal manner. But here we talk about with IQOS, smokers who want to enjoy when they are still enjoying today combustible cigarette, but different product that is mimicking very closely their pleasure, with clearly personal benefit on their health, but also on their lifestyle. So, I don't see the ZYN moment as something that is going to compete with IQOS in a meaningful manner. So, I think that that's not something that we see as a risk to undermine IQOS potential in the future. Yes, there is, Gaurav. So, I will take two examples, one in Europe when there was the menthol - the flavor ban in May 2020, where it had minimal impact on the combustible business, very, very small. So, that's one illustration. And the other one is actually - because we talk about growing products. The other one here is the ban on flavor in California that impacted ZYN at the end of 2022. And there was a few weeks with a blip on the volume. And then the momentum came back on non-flavored product actually with even more intensity and blip has been swallowed, and you don't see today any impact of this ban. So, I think here you have two element experiences that show that this is having minimum impact. And again, we're comparing in California with growing a category, which maybe is more appropriate, but referring to combustible in Europe in May 2020, the impact was de minimis. Yes. So, Bonnie, trying to be back on H2, I think you see it already in Q2. I mean, the momentum behind IQOS is there. We see it. We estimate 1.4 million user growth in Q2. That's an excellent number. We see in-market sales going up. We know that there is seasonality, but it doesn't mean that the consumer offtake is going to decrease. There is more launch of ILUMA and some of them that happened in the end of H1 that is going to contribute as well in the second part of the year. So, we see very robust momentum there. We see the work that we've been doing and as we said, the highest intensity of price increase has happened in Q2, is going to be lower in H2. And we've been defending our market share well in a market that is resilient. And we may discuss why CC is so resilient, but the fact is that combustible is proving to be resilient in many geographies. And then there is a ZYN moment, clearly a ZYN momentum, which we're not saying we're going to keep growing at 50%, of course, but clearly we expect momentum to continue super nicely on ZYN and starting Q4 that will also contribute to the organic growth. But in any case, it's going to fully contribute to adjusted EPS growth, excluding forex. So, all that give us the confidence that we are set for a very, very good and very strong H2 in terms of performance. Now, when we look towards 2024, we believe that the growth drivers are going to stay the same. So, IQOS, with of course the launch in Q2 in the US, but let's be clear, it's going to be the beginning. So, it's not going to immediately have a huge impact. It's going to be a ramp up, as we explained, but there will be a number of countries where ILUMA will be fully delivering. Look at Japan. That's quite interesting what happened in Japan. In fact, we've seen kind of another acceleration on market share and volume one year after the launch of ILUMA. So, it's not as if the old positive impact was happening in the first weeks. I would say takes some time to create the awareness, the understanding, and the positive appreciation. And then we're going to have ZYN and nicotine pouches. ZYN, first of all, starting in the US, but a number of exciting launch outside the US as well. So, that is boding well for 2024, but of course, it's premature to talk about '24, and we'll give guidance in due course. Sure, Bonnie. So, Japan, of course, is a matter of great satisfaction. I was alluding to it, the fact that one year after the launch of ILUMA, we see a further acceleration of our market share. We are now above 26%. And as I said, that shows that the brand keeps doing inroads, converting more people, making a big difference versus competition. And we are - actually, we've seen our capture share of the growth of the category that continue to grow increasing. We have a two-tier strategy between TEREA and SENTIA that is proving to be very efficient. So, we have the premium range, TEREA, with a lot of innovation, great flavor experience. And then we have SENTIA, which is of course at the lower level in term of positioning. But with this two, I would say range, we managed to really reach the broadest possible member of ILUMA user, and that's clearly showing some great success. We are back in Japan to see freight progressively. So, that was expected. Last year, the shipments were lower than the consumer uptake. And this year, that is of course not - we're going back to the normal situation. That was absolutely planned. And we see indeed competition while trying to fight. This is a category that keeps having a lot of traction and gaining share. They are fighting to keep growing when ILUMA is clearly doing well. And so far, they believe that their way forward is to come with cheaper consumable. That's of course their decision. I won't comment on that. It's clear that despite that, we managed to grow the share. But it's good to see that there is a clear growing commitment from the whole industry behind the category in Japan. Yes, Matt. So, there will be a progressive difficult for me - I mean, there will be events in Q3 and Q4 of launch of ILUMA in a number of countries. It's difficult for me to tell you whether it even spread, because I would've probably to do that depending on the size of each market, but it's going to be relatively well spread. Let's be clear. We have already two third of the IQOS volume that are exposed or benefit from ILUMA's presence. So, it's not marginal, but a big part of it has already been done. And as we said, at the beginning of ILUMA, we were not fully optimized on the product, on the productivity. It doesn't mean that everything will be done at the end of the year, but we expect to certainly see an acceleration of productivity, reduction in the weight in the second part of the year, and that will have a positive impact on margin evolution, absolutely in line with what I explained a number of headwinds that are receding in line with expectation. But that's really what you can expect for ILUMA in the second part of the year. Look, so far, I think that we've seen that pricing, it doesn't mean that the consumer is going away. I'm not able to tell you how it's going to further evolve in the future. I think what we see globally on the combustible market is first of all, a few markets where, because of the demographic, we see the consumption of combustible going up. I could certainly mention India, probably Egypt, Turkey, probably Vietnam, even if it's not a big market for us, where we see combustible business going up. The resilience is also coming from a number of markets where there is a ban on smoke-free products. So, of course, that is to some extent protecting the combustible business. As you know, that's clearly not something that we like. We think that it's a big mistake, but that is probably providing some resilience to the category overall. So, that would be my analogy on combustible. Sure, Owen. Actually, you may have seen that our share of the category has remained stable in Q2 at around 75%. So, it shows that indeed there is increased competition, but the quality of IQOS and notably ILUMA, but not just ILUMA, the overall IQOS proposition, is allowing us to, even if we're more premium, to maintain our share of the category, which is very good news. Here, I'm talking about volume. You can imagine in term of value, that is even higher. Now, let's be clear. Since the beginning, we knew, and I can say we were hoping for the whole industry to embrace heat-not-burn as the category of the future for inhalable nicotine product. And it's great to see a growing commitment from all the player behind that. So, no doubt that they will come with innovation. Our self, as you can imagine, we're going to continue to innovate as well. And we will see certainly innovation and maybe new things coming in the future. Now, after six, seven, almost eight years of launch of IQOS, I think in term of franchise, in term of impact, in term of strength, in term of brand power, I think we are really second to none. And we made a clear gap and differential. And I think that this is exactly what we did with Marlboro in the past, which Marlboro was a superior product and recognized for the brand that was unique. But on top of that, we managed to create a unique brand that was extremely appealing. And I think with IQOS, that's what we are repeating today. So IQOS products are clearly better recognized as such. It's a different customer experience, but then the IQOS brand is also iconic, and people are seeing that as part of lifestyle and product they want to associate themselves with, which is a recipe for long-term success. Yes. So, we can confirm that for the market where we've been launching today, we have no constraint, and therefore that's the reason why we've been able to move to sea freight. Now, there is still a ramp-up for the remaining markets that do not have ILUMA today. And this ramp-up is of course, accompanying the growing capacity. So, it doesn't mean that today we could serve on the 1st of July 100% of all the market, IQOS market with I ILUMA consumable, but we have no longer pressure restriction and the fact that we are back to sea freight, and we have a plan to accompany the growth of the remaining markets in the coming months. Yes. In fact, that's - sure. In fact, that's - Japan was finishing with lower shipment volume than consumer offtake in 2022. That has been reversing in 2023. And Europe went the other way round. Remember, we had too low because of uncertainty on the availability of product and energy supply in the manufacturing site. And that was expected, but the catchup has been happening mostly in Q1, but still a little bit in Q2. And now we expect to move to normal pattern of shipment versus consumer offtake or in-market sales. And therefore, we expect to have a strong H2, both in term of shipment progression and in-market sales in Europe, back to normal. Look, on Russia, we have nothing new to say. We've been explaining in the past communication that the situation was complex. There is no new element. I'm not going to comment on the situation of a company that I know nothing about. And we have nothing new to report on Russia at this stage. Well, we are, as you can imagine, complying with all regulation, restriction, sanction today, and we are obviously fully compliant. Talk to you soon. Thank you. Bye."

It is now my pleasure to introduce Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer. Over to you, Emmanuel.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, James, and welcome everyone. I am pleased to report that Q1 performance exceeded our expectations, with strong underlying momentum from IQOS, ZYN and our combustible business. As mentioned at our full-year earnings in February, we expected this quarter to be the weakest of the year due to a confluence of transitory factors impacting our top- and bottom-line. In this context, our business delivered robust results and we look forward with confidence to the remainder of the year. Smoke-free net revenues made up almost 35% of total PMI, despite the impact of adverse timing factors on HTU shipments, with an increasing number of markets crossing the 50% threshold. IQOS continues to deliver strong share and user growth across its geographies, both with the blade version and ILUMA. Where launched, ILUMA\u2019s excellent traction with both existing IQOS users and legal-age smokers is boosting growth, demonstrating the dynamism and importance of our ongoing innovation. ILUMA\u2019s progress is especially notable in the first launch market of Japan, where share growth has accelerated in recent quarters. In combustibles, accelerated pricing across a range of markets helped to deliver robust organic net revenue growth. Swedish Match delivered impressive results, with a stand-out performance from ZYN\u2019s 47% U.S. shipment volume growth compared to the first quarter of 2022. Following an encouraging start to the year, we are well set up to deliver strong performance in 2023 including excellent top- and bottom-line growth for the remainder of the year. Turning to the headline numbers, our Q1 organic net revenues saw robust growth of 3.2% against a very strong prior year quarter with organic growth of 9%. This reflects the continued strength of IQOS and a step-up in pricing but was partially offset by expected HTU inventory movements, which I will come back to. This organic figure does not include the excellent 14% ex-currency top-line growth of Swedish Match, led by ZYN. Our total reported currency-neutral net revenues grew by 9.6%, with combined pro forma adjusted net revenues increasing by around 4%, also excluding currency. Our total organic net revenue per unit grew by 4.4% with strong combustible pricing of 7.4% partially offset by HTU dynamics in Japan and Germany, which I will come back to momentarily. We delivered Q1 adjusted diluted EPS of $1.38, well above our previous expectations. This reflects a strong underlying delivery from our existing operations, excellent Swedish Match performance, and favorable phasing on interest costs. Compared to a record high prior year quarter, and with a number of one-off or accentuated margin headwinds from inflation, supply chain inefficiencies and timing factors as flagged previously, our adjusted diluted EPS contracted by 4.4%. Let me now walk through the mechanics of our Q1 net revenues. We delivered overall adjusted net revenue growth of 4.6% on an organic shipment volume decline of 1.1%. While not included in this number, Swedish Match\u2019s smoke-free volumes grew by an excellent 10% \u2013 adding impressive accretion to our overall growth profile. Combustible and HTU pricing, excluding Germany and Japan HTUs, contributed 5.3 points of growth, including positive HTU pricing in a number of markets. This was partly offset by a negative 1.3 point HTU impact from Germany and Japan. The larger of the two was Germany, reflecting a full quarter of the 2022 excise tax increase for which we await a court ruling later this year. In Japan, the October 2022 excise tax increase and transition to ILUMA were also a drag on our top-line, and we expect some of this impact to phase out in the second half. While the increasing mix of HTUs in our business, at higher net revenue per unit, continues to positively impact our performance, lower shipments in Europe this quarter due to wholesaler and distributor inventory movements limited the benefit. This was also the main driver for the difference between our smoke-free organic net revenue growth and HTU shipment volume growth. We expect this positive mix shift to accelerate as both smoke-free organic net revenue growth and HTU shipment growth align more closely with offtake trends for the year, as they also did in 2022. The positive mix impact of HTUs, overall volume growth, and pricing are powerful drivers of our transformation and growth. As expected, the first quarter was impacted by peak margin headwinds at both the gross margin and adjusted operating income level. Our gross margin contracted by 0.6 percentage points due to the net impact of COGS inflation, pricing, volume, mix and productivity savings. We expect the positive elements of pricing, productivities and favorable HTU category mix to increasingly compensate and ultimately outweigh inflation as we progress through the year. Supply chain disruption and the accelerated transition of consumers and our business to ILUMA accounted for a further 0.6 percentage points impact. We anticipate these items to abate as we progress with ILUMA launches and gain efficiencies in our supply chain, including a return to sea freight. In addition, specific cost phasing and the geographic mix of inventory movements, notably for HTUs in Europe, impacted our gross margin by 1.8 percentage points in the quarter. Despite these exceptional Q1 dynamics, we continue to forecast the full-year 2023 margin impact of our heat-not-burn business to be favorable as inventory movements and ILUMA-related factors dissipate. Therefore, and as explained previously, we expect a progressive improvement in our gross profit and OI margins, notably weighted towards H2 as headwinds subside and the underlying drivers of our transformation accelerate. At around 26% of adjusted net revenues, our Q1 SG&A costs are at a similar ratio to the full-year 2022. However, as expected there was a notable increase compared to Q1, 2022 given lower commercial spend at the beginning of last year, the inflationary environment, cost phasing, and front-loaded commercial investments. Our successful cost efficiencies program continues to deliver, enabling ongoing investment and helping to mitigate inflation, with $150 million of gross savings realized in Q1 of which almost $50 million were from SG&A. Importantly, we expect a significant slow-down in SG&A growth to a level below the rate of net revenue growth for the remainder of the year -- which will support OI margin improvement. This brings me to the outlook for 2023. Our robust Q1 performance supports visibility on strong full year growth. We continue to expect 7% to 8.5% organic top-line progression, with a targeted acceleration in HTU shipment volume growth versus 2022. As detailed in this morning\u2019s press release, our other operating assumptions remain unchanged, and we remind you that our organic metrics do not include the contribution from Swedish Match for the large majority of the year. Our updated full year adjusted diluted EPS forecast of $6.10 to $6.22 includes an estimated unfavorable currency impact of 30 cents. Positive estimated impacts from the Euro and a number of other currencies are outweighed mainly by the weakness of the Japanese Yen, as well as the significant depreciation of the Russian Ruble and the Egyptian Pound. This range continues to reflect 7% to 9% currency-neutral growth and does not include any contribution from a potential favorable excise tax ruling in Germany, which we would expect to add around 3 points to our adjusted diluted EPS related to 2023 tax payments. We continue to expect Swedish Match to be low single-digit accretive to our 2023 adjusted diluted EPS after financing, and for an increase of around $200 million in our non-acquisition related interest costs, despite a relatively modest increment in Q1. As discussed at full-year earnings in February, this year\u2019s bottom-line results are expected to be notably H2-weighted. However, we expect our organic net revenue growth to already accelerate in the second quarter into the high single-digits. We forecast second quarter HTU shipment volumes of between 30 and 32 billion, with adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $1.42 to $1.47, including an estimated unfavorable currency impact of 13 cents. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we expect close to double-digit organic top-line growth and a return to margin expansion. Looking at our full-year forecast through a different lens, after the temporary headwinds in Q1 we expect very strong performance for the remainder of the year. Despite ongoing margin headwinds and investments, we expect organic top-line growth of 8% to 10%, improving margins with expansion in H2 and currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of 10% to 13%. This reflects the strong underlying drivers of our transformation, with IQOS and ZYN driving volumes at a higher net revenue per unit, combined with stepped-up pricing on combustibles. Turning back to our Q1 results, our HTU adjusted IMS volumes grew by an estimated 16%, demonstrating continued strong growth momentum. HTU shipment volumes of 27.4 billion units were toward the higher end of our forecast range, with growth of 10.4%, which was well below actual offtake trends as anticipated, due to distributor and wholesaler inventory movements. As implied by our full-year HTU shipment forecast, we expect the rate of shipment growth to accelerate for the rest of the year as shipments converge with consumer offtake, and to grow at a faster pace in 2023 than in 2022. Before detailing these inventory impacts, it's important to note that in certain markets, such as Germany, IMS sales volumes are not measured at the point of distributor sales to the retail trade, as the data is not available. In these cases we instead use our shipments as the proxy. This means that shipment fluctuations can impact both IMS volumes and reported market share, and may not be representative of offtake dynamics. Given the volatility seen over this quarter and from now on, where there is a significant difference between estimated offtake performance and IMS data, we may choose to provide market share metrics based on adjusted IMS to better reflect offtake, where adjustments reflect the total estimated impact of distributor and wholesaler inventory movements. As you may note in the appendix to today\u2019s earnings release this is the case for Germany this quarter, where we also provide historical figures. Coming back to Q1, HTU shipment volumes in several European markets were below consumer offtake. This is explained by the reversal of some inventory build-ups at the end of Q4, 2022 to meet the needs of ILUMA launches, as mentioned at our full-year results in February, and also to create some safety stock to mitigate the risk of production and distribution constraints due to energy shortages. As anticipated, we were able to adjust this safety stock in Q1 as the risk receded. We also decreased the level of IQOS blade HTU inventories in several markets to reduce the risk of obsolete stock given the rapid transition to ILUMA. Notably impacted markets include Italy and Germany, where underlying market share and offtake trends remained strong. Italian Q1 IMS volumes grew by 21% compared to the prior year, with market share increasing from 15.4% in Q4 to 17.4% in Q1. In Germany, adjusted Q1 IMS volumes increased over 30% from the prior year with adjusted market share up from 4.7% in Q4 to 5.3% in Q1. Now turning back to the overall picture, while total Q1 cigarette and HTU shipment volumes declined by 1.1%, our total IMS volumes were essentially stable and grew excluding total estimated inventory movements. Our cigarette shipments declined by 3.1%, with resilient trends in many markets. The decline includes a notable impact from a high prior year comparison in Japan and the introduction of an abrupt excise tax increase in Pakistan, resulting in an increase in illicit trade and an industry contraction of over 30%. Volumes also declined in the Philippines following industry pricing, with consumer purchasing power facing ongoing pressure. We continue to target stable to positive combined cigarette and HTU shipment volumes for the year, following growth in 2021 and 2022. This notably does not include the excellent growth prospects of oral nicotine, for which shipment volumes grew by 10% in Q1. Most importantly, the exciting growth combination of IQOS and ZYN presents an unrivalled platform for growth over the coming years. Focusing now on combustibles, our portfolio delivered robust Q1 organic net revenue growth of 3%. This reflects strong pricing of 7.4% with a step-up across many markets including Germany, Indonesia, and the Philippines. With over 80% of planned 2023 combustible pricing implemented or announced, we have good visibility on the full year delivery, although some of the positive Q1 variance reflects earlier pricing compared to 2022. We now forecast a full-year variance of 6% to 7%. Our cigarette category share declined by 0.3 percentage points in Q1, which was essentially all attributable to geographic mix as the total industry declined in large volume markets such as the Philippines and Pakistan. The impact of share movements within markets was neutral, with gains including Egypt, Poland, and Turkey offset by declines in markets such as Ukraine, the Philippines, and Iraq. Importantly, we continue to target a stable category share in 2023 and over time, despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization. Moving now to our smoke-free products, we estimate there were 25.8 million IQOS users as of March 31st. This represents growth of close to 1 million adult users since December with notable progress in Japan and Europe, in addition to a broad range of other geographies. IQOS ILUMA has been a positive catalyst for volume and share growth across a broad range of launch markets, both supporting our strong position in the heat-not-burn category with a superior user experience, and fostering further category growth. For existing IQOS users, ILUMA drives an accelerated upgrade cycle. This enhances retention and full conversion for the future, with a temporary margin impact from concentrated device sales. Indeed, we are now approaching an estimated 10 million ILUMA users with ILUMA taking over 85% of HTU volumes in the first launch markets of Japan, Switzerland, and Spain. ILUMA is also enabling better acquisition and conversion of legal-age smokers, with market share acceleration visible in both earlier and more recently launched markets such as Italy and Korea. Since the introduction in these two markets in Q4, we are seeing encouraging trends in initial launch areas and expect this to be increasingly visible at the national level over time as it is in Japan and Greece, after a seasonal inflection in the latter. Our main focus in Q1 was on ensuring the success of ILUMA in the 16 markets launched by the end of 2022, which cover over half of our IQOS business by volumes. In addition, we launched ILUMA on a limited basis in Indonesia in February via our IQOS club members program. The IQOS club was introduced in 2019 and now has over 100 thousand estimated users across 10 cities, with a notable boost from the launch of ILUMA. We expect to progressively launch ILUMA in more markets this year. With ILUMA accelerating IQOS growth where launched, PMI HTUs continue to strengthen their position as the second largest nicotine 'brand' in markets where IQOS is present with a record high share of 9.0% in Q1. Impressively, as of Q1 PMI HTUs are now the number one nicotine brand in 10 markets with the addition of Italy and Greece during the quarter. Focusing now on Europe, which under our new regional structure includes additional markets such as Ukraine. Our first quarter HTU share increased by 1.7 points to reach 9.2% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume, adjusted for estimated wholesaler and distributor inventory movements, such as those I mentioned earlier in Germany and Italy. On the same adjusted basis, IMS volumes continued to grow sequentially and reached a record high of 11.1 billion units on a four-quarter moving average. This reflects strong progress across the region. We expect our Europe HTU volumes to grow strongly in the remainder of the year while, as in the past, our quarterly HTU share of market can be impacted by seasonality of cigarette consumption during Q2 and Q3. To give some further color on our outstanding progress in the region, slide 16 shows a selection of the latest key city offtake shares. The success of IQOS continues across a diverse range of geographies from Western, Southern, Central and Eastern Europe including markets with and without ILUMA. Notable stand-outs include Budapest with over 35% offtake share as well as Rome and Athens reaching the high twenties. To my earlier comments, we are very pleased with performance in Germany, where offtake share in Munich surpassed 10% for the first time. We are also encouraged by recent positive regulatory developments in Greece where the Ministry of Health approved differentiated health claims for heated tobacco products. Greece is the first country outside of the United States that permitted healthrelated statements following a robust scientific assessment. In Japan, the heat-not-burn category now represents over 35% of total tobacco with IQOS driving category growth. The acceleration seen in recent quarters continued in Q1. Adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by 3.4 points to 26.2% with offtake share surpassing 32% in Tokyo and 30% in Sendai. Adjusted IMS volumes again grew sequentially, reaching a record high of 9.0 billion units on a four-quarter moving average. Strong performance in Japan further highlights the importance of continuous innovation and a broad consumable portfolio. Our premium-priced TEREA HTUs and mainstream priced SENTIA HTUs continued to grow through Q1, strengthening their position as the two largest heat-not-burn brands. We are delighted with the progress in Japan and as we look forward to further robust volume growth in the coming quarters, we would also like to remind you of the seasonality impact on quarterly share metrics. In addition to strong IQOS gains in developed countries, we continue to see very promising growth in Low and Middle-Income markets which are now approaching 30% of our total HTU volumes. This slide highlights a selection of Q1 key city offtake shares across markets in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America. Notable successes include Bulgaria with Sofia offtake share of over 16% and Egypt, where offtake share in Cairo reached 7.5%. We also continue to see robust offtake volume growth across these important future markets. Now moving on to Swedish Match\u2019s business, which delivered an excellent Q1 performance with currency-neutral net revenue growth of 14% and smoke-free products comprising 77% of total net revenues. Most impressive was the continued outstanding performance of ZYN in the U.S. with 47% volume growth to 73 million cans. While volume growth benefited from inventory movements, including restocking in California following the December flavor ban, underlying growth in volumes was very strong, estimated well above 30%. We are also pleased with the Q1 performance in other U.S smoke-free categories, including moist snuff which gained 0.8 percentage points category share and delivered shipment volume growth of 3%. The smoke-free category in Scandinavia continued to grow driven by nicotine pouches, albeit at a slower rate following January snus excise tax increases in Sweden and Norway, with destocking accentuating the volume decline for Swedish Match\u2019s premium-skewed snus portfolio. In cigars, the business delivered positive pricing and robust shipment volume growth of 4% in a declining category driven by the strong development of natural leaf varieties. Finally, I would like to congratulate Swedish Match\u2019s employees for continuing to deliver excellent results as we thoughtfully integrate our activities. The integration is progressing very well and we look forward to sharing more on our combined growth plans later this year. Now let\u2019s examine ZYN\u2019s recent U.S. performance in more detail. Superb progress continues with a record increase in 12-month rolling shipment volumes of 23 million cans, which equates to 40% growth. Category volume share remained essentially stable despite continued heavy competitive discounting from less premium offerings. Importantly, retail value share for ZYN also remains strong at 75.6%, highlighting its premium positioning and superior brand equity. There are two key engines driving the U.S. growth of ZYN, as covered at CAGNY. First is the progressive increase in distribution, with the number of stores 13% higher than Q1, 2022 at around 140,000. There remains ample opportunity to further increase this over time. Second are velocities, or the number of cans sold per store per week. ZYN velocities continue to grow sequentially and by an impressive 21% compared to prior year as the brand continues to resonate with adult nicotine users. Now, let me update you on our exciting plans to further accelerate our smoke-free journey. As previously mentioned, the full global roll-out of IQOS ILUMA is a major priority. We are on track to make substantial progress this year as HTU manufacturing constraints continue to ease. We continue to work on our IQOS U.S. commercialization plans for launch in Q2 2024, in line with the principles outlined at the recent CAGNY conference. With the benefit of the expertise and commercial tools from launching IQOS successfully in over 70 international markets, and a U.S. market with a clear regulatory framework and the ability to communicate with adult smokers, we remain very positive about the opportunity. Importantly, we believe we can make the necessary investments in the U.S. business, generating additional top-line performance while continuing to deliver strong bottom-line growth for PMI during the investment period. In addition to our premium offerings, we are continuing to focus on BONDS, our latest heat-not-burn innovation that is especially relevant for Low and Middle-Income consumers. Pilot launches in the Philippines and Colombia are progressing well and we intend to continue taking the learnings from these markets before deploying on a wider scale. Another key mid-term opportunity from the Swedish Match combination is the international expansion of nicotine pouches, notably with ZYN -- the world\u2019s leading brand. At CAGNY I mentioned we are targeting up to ten launches or relaunches this year as we look to develop the category with adult smokers who value the convenience, specific use occasions, taste, and satisfaction. We expect this to commence in a few markets this summer, including both developed and emerging countries. While staying clearly focused on the heat-not-burn and nicotine pouch categories, which present the largest and most accretive growth opportunities, we are adjusting our VEEV e-vapor portfolio and approach. We intend to focus on commercializing in select markets and prioritizing profitability given the known category challenges. VEEV ONE is a new pod-based system providing an enhanced user experience with fully outsourced manufacturing of devices and consumables to optimize costs. VEEV ONE will replace the current VEEV product and, as a result, we no longer intend to file a PMTA for the former technology. Instead, we will focus our near-term FDA engagements on IQOS and ZYN. We will come back on future e-vapor FDA authorizations in due course. For disposables, the fastest growing e-vapor segment, we are rebranding VEEBA to VEEV NOW. All of our e-vapor products will now be under the single, recognizable brand VEEV for a seamless consumer experience. We will introduce the new VEEV ONE platform in Canada later this month and will apply an agile and disciplined approach for further VEEV roll-outs later this year. Moving to sustainability, I want to first draw your attention to our 2022 Integrated Report published earlier this month, which outlines the progress we are making towards achieving our purpose and smoke-free future. The report provides a comprehensive run-through of all our most material sustainability topics. This includes those in focus for investors such as post-consumer waste, youth access prevention, decarbonization, and our resource allocation towards advancing our smoke-free transformation. In conjunction with the Integrated Report, we also published an updated ESG KPI Protocol providing even more robust criteria on how we define success and measure ESG performance. It focuses on the KPIs included in our Sustainability Index, which as outlined in our 2023 proxy statement continue to represent 30% of our long-term performance-based equity executive compensation. I am also proud to announce that we released our first TCFD Report yesterday, which updates and compiles our previous disclosures on how we are implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures in one document. This will be an important topic for many companies as reporting regulations evolve. Lastly, we are also pleased that, following CDP\u2019s triple A recognition, PMI was again included in CDP\u2019s supplier engagement leaderboard, contributing towards achieving our scope 3 ambitions. To conclude today\u2019s presentation, we are on track for strong performance in 2023 despite margin headwinds. Our underlying growth fundamentals remain strong, and we expect these headwinds to progressively ease through the year. Indeed, we delivered higher-than-expected Q1 results which put us on-track for the third consecutive year of high single-digit organic net revenue growth. Continued excellent IQOS and ZYN performance further enhances our position as the global smoke-free champion with leadership positions in the largest category of heat-not-burn and the fastest growing category of oral nicotine. We are taking action through pricing in combustibles and our cost savings initiatives to recover cost inflation, as we progress rapidly toward our ambition to become a majority smoke-free business. Finally, we remain a highly cash generative business with an unwavering commitment to our progressive dividend policy. We look forward to further rewarding our shareholders as our transformation delivers sustainable growth. Thank you. We are now happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nBonnie Herzog: Thank you. Hi, everyone.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Good morning, Bonnie.\nBonnie Herzog: Hi. I guess, I have a question on your guidance as it relates to Q2, it does now seem to be a bit lighter implying a lot more of the growth is now expected to be in the back half. So just trying to get a sense of how conservative your Q2 guide might be? And then really, Emmanuel, how much visibility and confidence you have that your business really can accelerate and outperform the second half? Maybe you could highlight for us some of the key puts and takes that give you this confidence and maybe where you see the greatest potential upside and also just color on [Indiscernible]\nEmmanuel Babeau: Okay. No, sure, Bonnie, happy to do that. And I guess, thanks for the question, because that helps me clarify certainly the phasing of the profit generation this year. I think we are not coming with any different method from what we said back in February. We always said that we would be facing in the first-half of the year a number of headwinds on profitability that there would be some inventory movement playing. We highlighted that and we clearly said there will be margin improvement coming in the second part of the year and we are coming today exactly with the same message. We are pleased to have a Q1 that is above our initial expectation. We never gave guidance until today on Q2, but I think what we're seeing today on Q2 is coming with a lot of positives. We are explaining that we do expect an acceleration of the top line. We are talking about high single-digit growth that we are targeting for the second quarter and that's of course going to be a very nice contribution to the performance in the second quarter. That is highlighting the momentum that we have on the business that we see behind IQOS that is not capturing the ZYN growth for the second quarter. So ZYN is just coming in addition to this organic growth. So I think it gives an idea of how nicely up and running and dynamic is our business. Now in terms of margin, it is true that again in Q2, we're going to have a number of headwinds and notably at the level of the gross margin. So we're going to continue to have a number of impacts coming from inflation. This is going to be progressively corrected, but I think you should expect another quarter with a gross margin rate declining in a material manner versus 2022. And then the second part of the year will be still showing improvement again in line with our initial thought. Where I guess you're going to start seeing in terms of margin evolution some more positive impact, this is on the revenue -- sorry, SG&A to revenue ratio where we have seen a deterioration in Q1. I think I'm not saying that we will have SG&A growing at a lower pace than revenue in Q2, but I expect the growth of SG&A in Q2 to be closer to the revenue and therefore that will weight less on the operating income margin. But that's really what you should expect in terms of sequence for the year. Again, we expect very nice acceleration for the top line just confirming the nice momentum that we are experiencing in the business and we have this ramp-up on the margin that is coming progressively. It's going to show up first at the level of the SG&A on revenue. And in H2, we are expecting as we said a better evolution of the gross margin rate. So far, we're just confirming initial expectations.\nBonnie Herzog: No. That's super helpful and just sounds like you've got some pretty good visibility. So that's yes definitely helpful. And then, I guess, just maybe a quick high level question on the health of the consumer in, sort of, your key markets. If you could kind of touch on that for us? And then in the context of that, you've certainly been putting in a stronger combustible cig pricing. So just love to hear a little more color on how the consumer has been responding to those actions and really how confident you are that you're going to be able to continue to push through that pricing for the remainder of the year? Thanks.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes. I'm not going to say that we don't see any pressure on the consumer in the world. It is quite obvious and of course you are not talking about the U.S., which -- maybe you could deserve a separate comment. But it is clear that in countries such as the Philippines, for instance, we see some impact on the business coming from purchasing power. I think we see some of that as well in Indonesia. So they are markets where there was already some pressure on purchasing power particularly leading to some downtrading and that has continued to play as we progress through the beginning of 2023. But I have to say that in many markets, we haven't seen clear signs so far. We have to stay very cautious of course of pressure on the consumer all your massive downtrading. We don't see that. The Marlboro market share was a bit down, but I don't think that is clearly reflecting at that stage a pressure on the premium product of our portfolio. And we've been increasing price as you have seen in a very significant manner. Of course, competition not immediately or not totally responding to our price increase that can have an impact on our market share, but I would say so far, we have the feeling that in a highly inflationary environment, the consumer is ticking as normal and is not seeing as an issue to see also price increase on his tobacco product.\nBonnie Herzog: All right. Thanks for that color, Emmanuel. I appreciate it.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Gaurav Jain with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nGaurav Jain: Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my questions.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Good morning, Gaurav.\nGaurav Jain: So the first question I have -- good morning, so the first question I have is on FX. So in February, you had guided for a $0.15 headwind. Now it is $0.30, Egyptian pound had depreciated by Jan. And then, yes, yen has gone down a bit, but euro, which is a much bigger currency for you, is up also a bit more than that. So ruble can't be that big, right? Or is it becoming bigger this year versus last year? So could you just help us explain the effect.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes, Gaurav. So I think you rightly pointed to the ruble actually, if you are not going to disclose currency by currency, but if you look at the ruble, just the ruble is more than the net impact of $0.30 that today we are anticipating for the year. So I think it shows a very strong impact of the ruble. And the Egyptian pound continue to devaluate after January. So it's -- I'm not sure we had the full impact of the Egyptian pound. And actually, if you accumulate ruble and the Egyptian pound, you have 80% of the net impact of $0.30, it\u2019s a net impact. Don't get me wrong because you have also the yen that is quite negative. And then you have the euro and a number of other categories that is positive. But I think with the ruble and the Egyptian pound, you have a pretty good explanation of the net impact. I hope it's helpful.\nGaurav Jain: Okay, sure. And second, the U.S. cigarette volumes industry level are quite weak, minus 9%. And then looking at the European data that you shared, it is -- the industry volumes are flat on what were already very strong comps. And the reasons what have been mentioned for the U.S. industry weakness, which is macro, weak consumer, stimulus payments going off, disposable e-cigarette growth, I could apply the same logic to EU consumer -- EU smoker and still the volumes are so much better than trend. So is there a -- can you explain like why are the U.S. smoker and EU smoker, why are they behaving so differently?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Gaurav, I cannot -- and I will have to consider that I'm not the greatest specialist of the U.S. consumer for combustible cigarettes. So I wonder myself to given an analysis. I think it's in line with my previous comment on the fact that so far, we have been a pretty good resistance from the consumer to same price increase and coping with inflation in Europe. I'm not able to tell you why there is a difference here. We know that the social model in Europe is different. You may have some more protection, some more safety needs that are playing and maybe limiting the impact of inflation. There was maybe more compensation given from various government on trying to fight again energy price increase and sometimes compensating of agricultural product inflation across a number of geographies. So that can be one element to explain why the European consumer is resisting better. But I'm not going to pretend that I have the perfect answer to your question.\nGaurav Jain: Okay, thank you so much.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nPamela Kaufman: Hi, good morning.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Good morning, Pamela.\nPamela Kaufman: I was hoping that you could elaborate a bit more on your SG&A investment for this year? What are the key areas that you are investing behind and the step up in that investment in Q1? I guess how much of this reflects structural increases in inflation driving higher costs versus incremental investment that you're making behind ILUMA and your Health and Wellness and Swedish Match businesses?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Again, I'm going to try to go as far as I can, as you can imagine, some of that is super sensitive, so we're not going to share in detail what we are investing and where. First of all, trying to give you perspective for the full-year, we believe we're going to have our SG&A growing faster than revenue organically. But nevertheless, we expect a limited discrepancy between the two. So that means that as we progress through 2023, you should expect the growth of our SG&A to converge with the top line growth, I'm speaking here organic. And Q1 is really, I would say, impacted by a number of one-off both, by the way, on the basis of comparison, if you look at our Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 numbers last year, sequentially, you will see that Q1 was very low, both because we did not invest at the same moment of the year. So there is a phasing in investment and also because there was some one-off positive last year, so don't take Q1 as a reference. Having said that, we are facing inflation, of course, in our SG&A. It's a lot of people cost. And of course, we are increasing salaries. But we're also indeed generating some efficiency. So that is giving us some leeway to invest on our priority. It's about, of course, commercial investment on our priority, as you can expect. So it's everything on marketing commercial to boost IQOS. That is, of course, a big driver. It is the investment that we are making to prepare the U.S. We talk about the investment that we are making in Wellness and Healthcare. We continue to innovate a lot. We have innovation in the pipe for all our smoke-free product. And of course, that is also having some impact. So that is really what is driving this growth, and we continue to see as important this capacity that we have to cope with inflation, to invest for the future and at the same time, to have an SG&A evolution that thanks to the dynamism of the business is allowing us to still generate nice operating income and net profit growth. That's what I can share with you.\nPamela Kaufman: Okay. Thank you. And then can you talk about your change in your e-cig strategy? What prompted your strategy towards IQOS view? And how are you thinking about the category over the long-term and your participation in it?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Look, I think we've already been clear that while we were clearly developing some offering on the vaping category, this was not our priority. We had IQOS. And now I would say we are even more taken by two priorities, which are IQOS and ZYN. When you have such a fantastic team and the potential that they have to deliver very strong top line growth, volume growth, revenue growth and in a very nicely profitable fashion, that's really the priority. I guess you listened to us at CAGNY and we expressed the questioning that we have on the vaping category today, which are around the absence of clear regulation in many country. The fact that, that is giving way to an appropriate marketing activities, risk of underage consumption. And also the fact that this is a category where so far it's difficult. I'm not saying impossible, but difficult to see a lot of profitable model being developed. And therefore, that is pushing us to look at that and continue to work on this category and the fact that we are coming with this evolution of the range, I think, is just in line with the fact that the technology is evolving. We see the customer needs evolving as well, that's why we are developing VEEV now. But we're going to be focused. So it's not going to be across geography. It's going to be where the vaping category is relevant. It's going to be where we have a differentiation where we have the commercial strength to make an impact. And I think it is a much better strategy to do that, develop a few successes instead of exhausting ourselves in trying to develop something global today, when we don't see necessarily the ingredient of the driver for that to happen in an interesting manner, both in terms of growth, top line and bottom line progression.\nPamela Kaufman: Thanks. That\u2019s very helpful.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Vivien Azer with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nVivien Azer: Hi, good morning.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Good morning, Vivien.\nVivien Azer: So my first question is a follow-up to Gaurav's, please. In terms of your current FX outlook, does that contemplate another devaluation of the Egyptian pound, because my understanding is that's pretty well expected at this point?\nEmmanuel Babeau: So it does not because, of course, we don't have any idea of what it could be, when it could happen. So these are really an average that we take on the spot in the day before the announcement and not taking any kind of forward-looking or whatever consensus for currency evolution. You have a lot of people today that believe that the euro is set for a nice wide against the dollar in the coming months. Frankly, we're not betting on any kind of possible evolution, but really just working on the spot.\nVivien Azer: Okay. That's fair. I understand you're not in the business of predicting currency. It just seems like this is tied to the IMS bailout. So it seems reasonable to that. My follow-up question then is on the Swedish Match margins, which came in quite nicely. I was just curious, given the incremental inventory benefit that you saw in California, like how should we think about the 1Q margin in context of a normalized margin? Was there an incremental margin benefit that we should be backing out mentally as we think about what the appropriate level of profitability is for that business? Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Well, Vivien, I think what I can share with you is that I believe Q1 is just the bright confirmation of what we said, i.e., Swedish Match is coming with a very nicely accretive impact to the PMI growth. It is true for the volume, it is true for the revenue, and it is true for the profitability. So indeed, ZYN growing in the U.S. very nicely, and I don't come back on this north of 30% growth without the impact of California. That is driving a business that is nicely profitable, that is itself accretive to the Swedish Match average business. And therefore, of course, to PMI. And it is just very good news to have this engine for growth. Frankly, I mean, I don't want to repeat myself, but IQOS and ZYN together, that just a very exciting pair, and ZYN is coming as a very nice top line and margin enhancement role, and we expect that to continue.\nVivien Azer: Understood. Thank you very much.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Andrei Condrea with UBS. Please go ahead.\nAndrei Condrea: Hi, Emmanuel, thanks for taking my question.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Hi, Andrei.\nAndrei Condrea: Hi have -- two from me, please, if you don't mind. Firstly, on the input cost inflation side of things. Obviously, your ILUMA margins will have efficiencies coming online later this year. But in terms of the other headwinds you flagged, leaf and acetate tow is there any color what you can give on just how big these headwinds are?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Well, they are very material, but we flagged that. And I think once again, we explained that in Q1, and we expect that to continue in Q2. This big increase in energy price, leaf price, acetate tow is going to be the biggest driver for the pressure on the gross margin. Now as we enter the second-half of the year and notably towards the end of the year, we believe that these elements will be -- well, first of all, will be facing already with some of the bad news in H2. So of course, the period-on-period comparison will be, of course, easier. And then we keep working on productivity. We may keep working on our COGS to see all optimization. So this negative pressure and nothing is going to disappear, but it's going to ease versus what we are experiencing in H1. But I would expect in Q2, the pressure to remain very strong at that level.\nAndrei Condrea: That's very clear. Thank you. And my second question is a bit more long-term. Obviously, we saw one of your peers come out with a new product at the Investor Day for the nicotine pouch space for the U.S. And at the same time, your other peers bringing the European product in. Is there a scope for a similar innovation for ZYN, given the criticism -- well, rather than drawback it has -- it being of a much drier product versus the -- yes.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes, I believe that with Swedish Match, we have the biggest specialist, super-focused, knowledgeable player of the oral nicotine category. So we've been adding to that amazing skill, the 13 -- you may remember that we bought this company that is specialized in formulation of product some of them, including nicotine, and that can also come with very nice innovation in the form factors. So you should expect us. Of course, don't expect me to come down with detail, but you should certainly expect us to come with nice innovation. There is certainly the appetite in some area from the consumer to try new things, new [Indiscernible] with product to develop this oral nicotine category in other spaces, probably the consumer doesn't know as well what can be done, so it's for us, it's our duty to come and make some proposal. But I guess you can expect us, and I think we demonstrate that PMI and now in the PMI per Swedish Match to be leading innovation in this category as well in the future.\nAndrei Condrea: Fantastic. Thank you very much.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Matt Smith of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMatt Smith: Hi, thank you for the question.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Hi, Matt.\nMatt Smith: The incremental number of IQOS users stepped up in the first quarter to about 900 million additional users on a sequential basis. Can you provide more details regarding the favorable conversion trends you've seen behind ILUMA? And should we expect IQOS user growth to accelerate in the second-half as ILUMA capacity improves and you expand the geographical footprint of the product?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you. So yes, we are close to 1 million additional IQOS user in Q1. It's a nice number. It's not something that we can beat. I think that there is opportunity to further accelerate as we continue in Q2 and beyond. But first of all, I would like to have a few words of cautiousness. It's not a scientific number, that's an estimate, and that can have some variation depending on the number of elements. But I think, directionally, it is correct, and I think it shows the very strong momentum of IQOS. It is confirmed, of course, by the consumer offtake that we've been describing. It is clear that ILUMA is helping this conversion. So what we see with ILUMA is a higher capacity to convince smokers, because it is a more seamless experience. There is no cleaning. It is even closer the ritual of the combustible cigarettes. The overall experience is more satisfying. So the abandonment rate is lower. And of course, we talk about net user acquisition, so that is also helping. We have very nice progression of the consumer satisfaction in all countries. That is -- I guess, probably supporting the lower abandonment. So it is clear that the more we go for ILUMA, the more we are in the capacity to accelerate conversion. Japan, I think -- I mean, we're coming with a number in Japan and you can build the history. I think Japan is providing a lot of interesting information, because it took some time. I mean the acceleration that we have since Q3 in Japan is quite spectacular, frankly, and probably goes beyond our expectation. But it shows that ILUMA is probably -- gradually getting traction with, I don't know, it's a word of mouth. And -- but the consumer is realizing that this is making a big impact. And frankly, the acceleration of the market share to north of 26%, and I'm not talking about Tokyo, but average Japanese market share is a significant acceleration. It started in Q4, but it accelerated, and it's one year after the launch. So it shows that not everything is happening in the first quarter of the launch. I think we're showing a number of chart here showing that. And that bodes well for a nice ramp up in the coming quarters as not only do we have to start to launch ILUMA in a number of countries, but we know that this positive effect will spread over the coming quarters. So we take that as a nice driver for user acquisition growth in the coming quarters.\nMatt Smith: Yes. Thank you for that detail. And a follow-up on a comment you mentioned on the call about maintaining profit growth in the U.S. as you launch IQOS. Can you talk about the investment needs in the U.S. to support commercialization? And how the $75 million or so of investment here in 2023 against this begins to build out the infrastructure necessary for a broader IQOS launch?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes. Well, that's the additional investment. But of course, we are already starting with some investment in the U.S. We'll come at the time of the Investor Day in September with detailed plan on how we intend to grow IQOS in the U.S. And at that time, of course, we share much more color on the level of investment that we believe is going to be necessary. I think the important message, because we have a lot of questions here is the fact that, yes, of course, in order to express what we think is a great potential of IQOS in the U.S., investment will be needed. By the way, we've been investing to build this phenomenal business for IQOS in Japan and Europe. I mean we've been investing. It didn't come by chance. So we will invest in the U.S. But what we are seeing is that, given the growth momentum that we have in the business, we think that investing in the U.S. behind IQOS will, first of all, provide even more momentum on the top line and that we can absorb this investment, while continuing to grow the bottom line very nicely. We're not ready to compromise on bottom line growth because of investment that we need to make in the U.S. If I want to repeat something that I said already, I think the question mark will be, what is the differential that we can generate between top line growth and bottom line growth? Remember, the last algorithm was 5% and 9%, above 5%, above 9%. Well, if we increase more than 5% the gross rate perspective, it doesn't mean that we're going to keep a 4 points of difference between top line growth and bottom line growth. That's the sense of the comments. I hope it's helpful.\nMatt Smith: Very helpful. Thank you very much.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jared Dinges with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJared Dinges: Yes. Hi, guys. I want to ask about ZYN growth in the U.S., which seemed to actually accelerate in the offtake data, despite the base continuing to grow, and it's actually pretty sizable now. Do you think there's any benefit there from the investments that you started to make as part of your IQOS preparation in terms of building out maybe a sales network? Are you also increasing SG&A investments in ZYN alone? I'm just thinking of this in the context of the brand is getting bigger, we're seeing the cigarette data has clearly been very weak, but yet the trend continues to do very well. So just trying to understand what's really driving that?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thanks, Jared, for the question. Well, first of all, yes, we are, of course, extremely pleased with the performance of ZYN in the U.S. And I want to pay a tribute to the work that the team is doing there, which is absolutely fantastic. No, I don't think that there is yet a sizable impact coming from our investment in the U.S. I think it's being developed on the merit of the great commercial plan and action. The brand has amazing traction. I think that it's extremely highly regarded by the consumer premium brand, a very nice franchise. And they are building on these two drivers, as explained, one geography. The other one is consumption per store. We just show that two things. One, of course, we have enriched the full geographical coverage. And that's where probably in the coming quarters, you will see some acceleration as we're going to put more feet in the street and more capacity to visit retail stores. And the other thing is that there is a growing knowledge, understanding and appetite for the category and for ZYN that epitomes the category, and that's what we are seeing. So, so far, no really increased investment behind the natural increase when you have such a nice growth, of course, increase investment year-on-year. So we do increase investment in the U.S., but nothing, kind of, at the stage accelerated plan and not yet impact coming from investment on IQOS that should come in the future.\nJared Dinges: Perfect. Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our final question from Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nPriya Joy Ohri-Gupta: Hello and thanks for squeezing me in. Emmanuel, I was hoping that we could touch on your cash flow performance in the quarter a little bit. It sounds like the weakness was somewhat related to timing factors, because 1Q is seasonally your weakest. But if you could just walk us through sort of what the drivers for that negative cash flow from operations figure.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes, absolutely. So indeed, Q1 has not been great in terms of cash flow performance. But that was, again, expected. That is linked with the timing of shipments, excise duty payment and some of the working capital. And there was nothing surprising. I mean, I would prefer to see higher operating cash generation in Q1, but that was expected. And we are absolutely confirming the objective for the year of an operating cash flow between $10 billion to $11 billion.\nPriya Joy Ohri-Gupta: Okay. And then just a housekeeping item. Can you give us the pro forma leverage, including the benefit of Swedish Match, for a full-year versus the reported numbers that were in the release?\nEmmanuel Babeau: No, I don't think it was in the release. I don't know whether we'll communicate that. But I mean, you can come to it. I'm not sure to understand fully what your question I think you have the data to calculate things, but you can come back to us and we'll see whether we can show where the information is available.\nPriya Joy Ohri-Gupta: Sure. I think that the sequential increase in leverage, if you put in a full-year's benefit of Swedish Match, just closer to about 0.2 of a turn versus the higher figure that was reported directionally.\nEmmanuel Babeau: No, I think you're alluding to the fact that we concluded 2022 saying, well, we are around 2.9 times, but of course, that would be lower and significantly lower. And maybe about what you are seeing here, if you were to take the full-year of Swedish Match.\nPriya Joy Ohri-Gupta: Okay, perfect. Thank you so much.\nEmmanuel Babeau: You\u2019re most welcome.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the management team for any closing remarks.\nJames Bushnell: Thank you all for joining today. That concludes our call. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations team. Thank you again, and have a great day.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you all. Talk to you soon. Thank you. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Emmanuel Babeau",
            "content": "Thank you, James, and welcome everyone. I am pleased to report that Q1 performance exceeded our expectations, with strong underlying momentum from IQOS, ZYN and our combustible business. As mentioned at our full-year earnings in February, we expected this quarter to be the weakest of the year due to a confluence of transitory factors impacting our top- and bottom-line. In this context, our business delivered robust results and we look forward with confidence to the remainder of the year. Smoke-free net revenues made up almost 35% of total PMI, despite the impact of adverse timing factors on HTU shipments, with an increasing number of markets crossing the 50% threshold. IQOS continues to deliver strong share and user growth across its geographies, both with the blade version and ILUMA. Where launched, ILUMA's excellent traction with both existing IQOS users and legal-age smokers is boosting growth, demonstrating the dynamism and importance of our ongoing innovation. ILUMA's progress is especially notable in the first launch market of Japan, where share growth has accelerated in recent quarters. In combustibles, accelerated pricing across a range of markets helped to deliver robust organic net revenue growth. Swedish Match delivered impressive results, with a stand-out performance from ZYN's 47% U.S. shipment volume growth compared to the first quarter of 2022. Following an encouraging start to the year, we are well set up to deliver strong performance in 2023 including excellent top- and bottom-line growth for the remainder of the year. Turning to the headline numbers, our Q1 organic net revenues saw robust growth of 3.2% against a very strong prior year quarter with organic growth of 9%. This reflects the continued strength of IQOS and a step-up in pricing but was partially offset by expected HTU inventory movements, which I will come back to. This organic figure does not include the excellent 14% ex-currency top-line growth of Swedish Match, led by ZYN. Our total reported currency-neutral net revenues grew by 9.6%, with combined pro forma adjusted net revenues increasing by around 4%, also excluding currency. Our total organic net revenue per unit grew by 4.4% with strong combustible pricing of 7.4% partially offset by HTU dynamics in Japan and Germany, which I will come back to momentarily. We delivered Q1 adjusted diluted EPS of $1.38, well above our previous expectations. This reflects a strong underlying delivery from our existing operations, excellent Swedish Match performance, and favorable phasing on interest costs. Compared to a record high prior year quarter, and with a number of one-off or accentuated margin headwinds from inflation, supply chain inefficiencies and timing factors as flagged previously, our adjusted diluted EPS contracted by 4.4%. Let me now walk through the mechanics of our Q1 net revenues. We delivered overall adjusted net revenue growth of 4.6% on an organic shipment volume decline of 1.1%. While not included in this number, Swedish Match's smoke-free volumes grew by an excellent 10% \u2013 adding impressive accretion to our overall growth profile. Combustible and HTU pricing, excluding Germany and Japan HTUs, contributed 5.3 points of growth, including positive HTU pricing in a number of markets. This was partly offset by a negative 1.3 point HTU impact from Germany and Japan. The larger of the two was Germany, reflecting a full quarter of the 2022 excise tax increase for which we await a court ruling later this year. In Japan, the October 2022 excise tax increase and transition to ILUMA were also a drag on our top-line, and we expect some of this impact to phase out in the second half. While the increasing mix of HTUs in our business, at higher net revenue per unit, continues to positively impact our performance, lower shipments in Europe this quarter due to wholesaler and distributor inventory movements limited the benefit. This was also the main driver for the difference between our smoke-free organic net revenue growth and HTU shipment volume growth. We expect this positive mix shift to accelerate as both smoke-free organic net revenue growth and HTU shipment growth align more closely with offtake trends for the year, as they also did in 2022. The positive mix impact of HTUs, overall volume growth, and pricing are powerful drivers of our transformation and growth. As expected, the first quarter was impacted by peak margin headwinds at both the gross margin and adjusted operating income level. Our gross margin contracted by 0.6 percentage points due to the net impact of COGS inflation, pricing, volume, mix and productivity savings. We expect the positive elements of pricing, productivities and favorable HTU category mix to increasingly compensate and ultimately outweigh inflation as we progress through the year. Supply chain disruption and the accelerated transition of consumers and our business to ILUMA accounted for a further 0.6 percentage points impact. We anticipate these items to abate as we progress with ILUMA launches and gain efficiencies in our supply chain, including a return to sea freight. In addition, specific cost phasing and the geographic mix of inventory movements, notably for HTUs in Europe, impacted our gross margin by 1.8 percentage points in the quarter. Despite these exceptional Q1 dynamics, we continue to forecast the full-year 2023 margin impact of our heat-not-burn business to be favorable as inventory movements and ILUMA-related factors dissipate. Therefore, and as explained previously, we expect a progressive improvement in our gross profit and OI margins, notably weighted towards H2 as headwinds subside and the underlying drivers of our transformation accelerate. At around 26% of adjusted net revenues, our Q1 SG&A costs are at a similar ratio to the full-year 2022. However, as expected there was a notable increase compared to Q1, 2022 given lower commercial spend at the beginning of last year, the inflationary environment, cost phasing, and front-loaded commercial investments. Our successful cost efficiencies program continues to deliver, enabling ongoing investment and helping to mitigate inflation, with $150 million of gross savings realized in Q1 of which almost $50 million were from SG&A. Importantly, we expect a significant slow-down in SG&A growth to a level below the rate of net revenue growth for the remainder of the year -- which will support OI margin improvement. This brings me to the outlook for 2023. Our robust Q1 performance supports visibility on strong full year growth. We continue to expect 7% to 8.5% organic top-line progression, with a targeted acceleration in HTU shipment volume growth versus 2022. As detailed in this morning's press release, our other operating assumptions remain unchanged, and we remind you that our organic metrics do not include the contribution from Swedish Match for the large majority of the year. Our updated full year adjusted diluted EPS forecast of $6.10 to $6.22 includes an estimated unfavorable currency impact of 30 cents. Positive estimated impacts from the Euro and a number of other currencies are outweighed mainly by the weakness of the Japanese Yen, as well as the significant depreciation of the Russian Ruble and the Egyptian Pound. This range continues to reflect 7% to 9% currency-neutral growth and does not include any contribution from a potential favorable excise tax ruling in Germany, which we would expect to add around 3 points to our adjusted diluted EPS related to 2023 tax payments. We continue to expect Swedish Match to be low single-digit accretive to our 2023 adjusted diluted EPS after financing, and for an increase of around $200 million in our non-acquisition related interest costs, despite a relatively modest increment in Q1. As discussed at full-year earnings in February, this year's bottom-line results are expected to be notably H2-weighted. However, we expect our organic net revenue growth to already accelerate in the second quarter into the high single-digits. We forecast second quarter HTU shipment volumes of between 30 and 32 billion, with adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $1.42 to $1.47, including an estimated unfavorable currency impact of 13 cents. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we expect close to double-digit organic top-line growth and a return to margin expansion. Looking at our full-year forecast through a different lens, after the temporary headwinds in Q1 we expect very strong performance for the remainder of the year. Despite ongoing margin headwinds and investments, we expect organic top-line growth of 8% to 10%, improving margins with expansion in H2 and currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of 10% to 13%. This reflects the strong underlying drivers of our transformation, with IQOS and ZYN driving volumes at a higher net revenue per unit, combined with stepped-up pricing on combustibles. Turning back to our Q1 results, our HTU adjusted IMS volumes grew by an estimated 16%, demonstrating continued strong growth momentum. HTU shipment volumes of 27.4 billion units were toward the higher end of our forecast range, with growth of 10.4%, which was well below actual offtake trends as anticipated, due to distributor and wholesaler inventory movements. As implied by our full-year HTU shipment forecast, we expect the rate of shipment growth to accelerate for the rest of the year as shipments converge with consumer offtake, and to grow at a faster pace in 2023 than in 2022. Before detailing these inventory impacts, it's important to note that in certain markets, such as Germany, IMS sales volumes are not measured at the point of distributor sales to the retail trade, as the data is not available. In these cases we instead use our shipments as the proxy. This means that shipment fluctuations can impact both IMS volumes and reported market share, and may not be representative of offtake dynamics. Given the volatility seen over this quarter and from now on, where there is a significant difference between estimated offtake performance and IMS data, we may choose to provide market share metrics based on adjusted IMS to better reflect offtake, where adjustments reflect the total estimated impact of distributor and wholesaler inventory movements. As you may note in the appendix to today's earnings release this is the case for Germany this quarter, where we also provide historical figures. Coming back to Q1, HTU shipment volumes in several European markets were below consumer offtake. This is explained by the reversal of some inventory build-ups at the end of Q4, 2022 to meet the needs of ILUMA launches, as mentioned at our full-year results in February, and also to create some safety stock to mitigate the risk of production and distribution constraints due to energy shortages. As anticipated, we were able to adjust this safety stock in Q1 as the risk receded. We also decreased the level of IQOS blade HTU inventories in several markets to reduce the risk of obsolete stock given the rapid transition to ILUMA. Notably impacted markets include Italy and Germany, where underlying market share and offtake trends remained strong. Italian Q1 IMS volumes grew by 21% compared to the prior year, with market share increasing from 15.4% in Q4 to 17.4% in Q1. In Germany, adjusted Q1 IMS volumes increased over 30% from the prior year with adjusted market share up from 4.7% in Q4 to 5.3% in Q1. Now turning back to the overall picture, while total Q1 cigarette and HTU shipment volumes declined by 1.1%, our total IMS volumes were essentially stable and grew excluding total estimated inventory movements. Our cigarette shipments declined by 3.1%, with resilient trends in many markets. The decline includes a notable impact from a high prior year comparison in Japan and the introduction of an abrupt excise tax increase in Pakistan, resulting in an increase in illicit trade and an industry contraction of over 30%. Volumes also declined in the Philippines following industry pricing, with consumer purchasing power facing ongoing pressure. We continue to target stable to positive combined cigarette and HTU shipment volumes for the year, following growth in 2021 and 2022. This notably does not include the excellent growth prospects of oral nicotine, for which shipment volumes grew by 10% in Q1. Most importantly, the exciting growth combination of IQOS and ZYN presents an unrivalled platform for growth over the coming years. Focusing now on combustibles, our portfolio delivered robust Q1 organic net revenue growth of 3%. This reflects strong pricing of 7.4% with a step-up across many markets including Germany, Indonesia, and the Philippines. With over 80% of planned 2023 combustible pricing implemented or announced, we have good visibility on the full year delivery, although some of the positive Q1 variance reflects earlier pricing compared to 2022. We now forecast a full-year variance of 6% to 7%. Our cigarette category share declined by 0.3 percentage points in Q1, which was essentially all attributable to geographic mix as the total industry declined in large volume markets such as the Philippines and Pakistan. The impact of share movements within markets was neutral, with gains including Egypt, Poland, and Turkey offset by declines in markets such as Ukraine, the Philippines, and Iraq. Importantly, we continue to target a stable category share in 2023 and over time, despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization. Moving now to our smoke-free products, we estimate there were 25.8 million IQOS users as of March 31st. This represents growth of close to 1 million adult users since December with notable progress in Japan and Europe, in addition to a broad range of other geographies. IQOS ILUMA has been a positive catalyst for volume and share growth across a broad range of launch markets, both supporting our strong position in the heat-not-burn category with a superior user experience, and fostering further category growth. For existing IQOS users, ILUMA drives an accelerated upgrade cycle. This enhances retention and full conversion for the future, with a temporary margin impact from concentrated device sales. Indeed, we are now approaching an estimated 10 million ILUMA users with ILUMA taking over 85% of HTU volumes in the first launch markets of Japan, Switzerland, and Spain. ILUMA is also enabling better acquisition and conversion of legal-age smokers, with market share acceleration visible in both earlier and more recently launched markets such as Italy and Korea. Since the introduction in these two markets in Q4, we are seeing encouraging trends in initial launch areas and expect this to be increasingly visible at the national level over time as it is in Japan and Greece, after a seasonal inflection in the latter. Our main focus in Q1 was on ensuring the success of ILUMA in the 16 markets launched by the end of 2022, which cover over half of our IQOS business by volumes. In addition, we launched ILUMA on a limited basis in Indonesia in February via our IQOS club members program. The IQOS club was introduced in 2019 and now has over 100 thousand estimated users across 10 cities, with a notable boost from the launch of ILUMA. We expect to progressively launch ILUMA in more markets this year. With ILUMA accelerating IQOS growth where launched, PMI HTUs continue to strengthen their position as the second largest nicotine 'brand' in markets where IQOS is present with a record high share of 9.0% in Q1. Impressively, as of Q1 PMI HTUs are now the number one nicotine brand in 10 markets with the addition of Italy and Greece during the quarter. Focusing now on Europe, which under our new regional structure includes additional markets such as Ukraine. Our first quarter HTU share increased by 1.7 points to reach 9.2% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume, adjusted for estimated wholesaler and distributor inventory movements, such as those I mentioned earlier in Germany and Italy. On the same adjusted basis, IMS volumes continued to grow sequentially and reached a record high of 11.1 billion units on a four-quarter moving average. This reflects strong progress across the region. We expect our Europe HTU volumes to grow strongly in the remainder of the year while, as in the past, our quarterly HTU share of market can be impacted by seasonality of cigarette consumption during Q2 and Q3. To give some further color on our outstanding progress in the region, slide 16 shows a selection of the latest key city offtake shares. The success of IQOS continues across a diverse range of geographies from Western, Southern, Central and Eastern Europe including markets with and without ILUMA. Notable stand-outs include Budapest with over 35% offtake share as well as Rome and Athens reaching the high twenties. To my earlier comments, we are very pleased with performance in Germany, where offtake share in Munich surpassed 10% for the first time. We are also encouraged by recent positive regulatory developments in Greece where the Ministry of Health approved differentiated health claims for heated tobacco products. Greece is the first country outside of the United States that permitted healthrelated statements following a robust scientific assessment. In Japan, the heat-not-burn category now represents over 35% of total tobacco with IQOS driving category growth. The acceleration seen in recent quarters continued in Q1. Adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by 3.4 points to 26.2% with offtake share surpassing 32% in Tokyo and 30% in Sendai. Adjusted IMS volumes again grew sequentially, reaching a record high of 9.0 billion units on a four-quarter moving average. Strong performance in Japan further highlights the importance of continuous innovation and a broad consumable portfolio. Our premium-priced TEREA HTUs and mainstream priced SENTIA HTUs continued to grow through Q1, strengthening their position as the two largest heat-not-burn brands. We are delighted with the progress in Japan and as we look forward to further robust volume growth in the coming quarters, we would also like to remind you of the seasonality impact on quarterly share metrics. In addition to strong IQOS gains in developed countries, we continue to see very promising growth in Low and Middle-Income markets which are now approaching 30% of our total HTU volumes. This slide highlights a selection of Q1 key city offtake shares across markets in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America. Notable successes include Bulgaria with Sofia offtake share of over 16% and Egypt, where offtake share in Cairo reached 7.5%. We also continue to see robust offtake volume growth across these important future markets. Now moving on to Swedish Match's business, which delivered an excellent Q1 performance with currency-neutral net revenue growth of 14% and smoke-free products comprising 77% of total net revenues. Most impressive was the continued outstanding performance of ZYN in the U.S. with 47% volume growth to 73 million cans. While volume growth benefited from inventory movements, including restocking in California following the December flavor ban, underlying growth in volumes was very strong, estimated well above 30%. We are also pleased with the Q1 performance in other U.S smoke-free categories, including moist snuff which gained 0.8 percentage points category share and delivered shipment volume growth of 3%. The smoke-free category in Scandinavia continued to grow driven by nicotine pouches, albeit at a slower rate following January snus excise tax increases in Sweden and Norway, with destocking accentuating the volume decline for Swedish Match's premium-skewed snus portfolio. In cigars, the business delivered positive pricing and robust shipment volume growth of 4% in a declining category driven by the strong development of natural leaf varieties. Finally, I would like to congratulate Swedish Match's employees for continuing to deliver excellent results as we thoughtfully integrate our activities. The integration is progressing very well and we look forward to sharing more on our combined growth plans later this year. Now let's examine ZYN's recent U.S. performance in more detail. Superb progress continues with a record increase in 12-month rolling shipment volumes of 23 million cans, which equates to 40% growth. Category volume share remained essentially stable despite continued heavy competitive discounting from less premium offerings. Importantly, retail value share for ZYN also remains strong at 75.6%, highlighting its premium positioning and superior brand equity. There are two key engines driving the U.S. growth of ZYN, as covered at CAGNY. First is the progressive increase in distribution, with the number of stores 13% higher than Q1, 2022 at around 140,000. There remains ample opportunity to further increase this over time. Second are velocities, or the number of cans sold per store per week. ZYN velocities continue to grow sequentially and by an impressive 21% compared to prior year as the brand continues to resonate with adult nicotine users. Now, let me update you on our exciting plans to further accelerate our smoke-free journey. As previously mentioned, the full global roll-out of IQOS ILUMA is a major priority. We are on track to make substantial progress this year as HTU manufacturing constraints continue to ease. We continue to work on our IQOS U.S. commercialization plans for launch in Q2 2024, in line with the principles outlined at the recent CAGNY conference. With the benefit of the expertise and commercial tools from launching IQOS successfully in over 70 international markets, and a U.S. market with a clear regulatory framework and the ability to communicate with adult smokers, we remain very positive about the opportunity. Importantly, we believe we can make the necessary investments in the U.S. business, generating additional top-line performance while continuing to deliver strong bottom-line growth for PMI during the investment period. In addition to our premium offerings, we are continuing to focus on BONDS, our latest heat-not-burn innovation that is especially relevant for Low and Middle-Income consumers. Pilot launches in the Philippines and Colombia are progressing well and we intend to continue taking the learnings from these markets before deploying on a wider scale. Another key mid-term opportunity from the Swedish Match combination is the international expansion of nicotine pouches, notably with ZYN -- the world's leading brand. At CAGNY I mentioned we are targeting up to ten launches or relaunches this year as we look to develop the category with adult smokers who value the convenience, specific use occasions, taste, and satisfaction. We expect this to commence in a few markets this summer, including both developed and emerging countries. While staying clearly focused on the heat-not-burn and nicotine pouch categories, which present the largest and most accretive growth opportunities, we are adjusting our VEEV e-vapor portfolio and approach. We intend to focus on commercializing in select markets and prioritizing profitability given the known category challenges. VEEV ONE is a new pod-based system providing an enhanced user experience with fully outsourced manufacturing of devices and consumables to optimize costs. VEEV ONE will replace the current VEEV product and, as a result, we no longer intend to file a PMTA for the former technology. Instead, we will focus our near-term FDA engagements on IQOS and ZYN. We will come back on future e-vapor FDA authorizations in due course. For disposables, the fastest growing e-vapor segment, we are rebranding VEEBA to VEEV NOW. All of our e-vapor products will now be under the single, recognizable brand VEEV for a seamless consumer experience. We will introduce the new VEEV ONE platform in Canada later this month and will apply an agile and disciplined approach for further VEEV roll-outs later this year. Moving to sustainability, I want to first draw your attention to our 2022 Integrated Report published earlier this month, which outlines the progress we are making towards achieving our purpose and smoke-free future. The report provides a comprehensive run-through of all our most material sustainability topics. This includes those in focus for investors such as post-consumer waste, youth access prevention, decarbonization, and our resource allocation towards advancing our smoke-free transformation. In conjunction with the Integrated Report, we also published an updated ESG KPI Protocol providing even more robust criteria on how we define success and measure ESG performance. It focuses on the KPIs included in our Sustainability Index, which as outlined in our 2023 proxy statement continue to represent 30% of our long-term performance-based equity executive compensation. I am also proud to announce that we released our first TCFD Report yesterday, which updates and compiles our previous disclosures on how we are implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures in one document. This will be an important topic for many companies as reporting regulations evolve. Lastly, we are also pleased that, following CDP's triple A recognition, PMI was again included in CDP's supplier engagement leaderboard, contributing towards achieving our scope 3 ambitions. To conclude today's presentation, we are on track for strong performance in 2023 despite margin headwinds. Our underlying growth fundamentals remain strong, and we expect these headwinds to progressively ease through the year. Indeed, we delivered higher-than-expected Q1 results which put us on-track for the third consecutive year of high single-digit organic net revenue growth. Continued excellent IQOS and ZYN performance further enhances our position as the global smoke-free champion with leadership positions in the largest category of heat-not-burn and the fastest growing category of oral nicotine. We are taking action through pricing in combustibles and our cost savings initiatives to recover cost inflation, as we progress rapidly toward our ambition to become a majority smoke-free business. Finally, we remain a highly cash generative business with an unwavering commitment to our progressive dividend policy. We look forward to further rewarding our shareholders as our transformation delivers sustainable growth. Thank you. We are now happy to answer your questions. Good morning, Bonnie. Okay. No, sure, Bonnie, happy to do that. And I guess, thanks for the question, because that helps me clarify certainly the phasing of the profit generation this year. I think we are not coming with any different method from what we said back in February. We always said that we would be facing in the first-half of the year a number of headwinds on profitability that there would be some inventory movement playing. We highlighted that and we clearly said there will be margin improvement coming in the second part of the year and we are coming today exactly with the same message. We are pleased to have a Q1 that is above our initial expectation. We never gave guidance until today on Q2, but I think what we're seeing today on Q2 is coming with a lot of positives. We are explaining that we do expect an acceleration of the top line. We are talking about high single-digit growth that we are targeting for the second quarter and that's of course going to be a very nice contribution to the performance in the second quarter. That is highlighting the momentum that we have on the business that we see behind IQOS that is not capturing the ZYN growth for the second quarter. So ZYN is just coming in addition to this organic growth. So I think it gives an idea of how nicely up and running and dynamic is our business. Now in terms of margin, it is true that again in Q2, we're going to have a number of headwinds and notably at the level of the gross margin. So we're going to continue to have a number of impacts coming from inflation. This is going to be progressively corrected, but I think you should expect another quarter with a gross margin rate declining in a material manner versus 2022. And then the second part of the year will be still showing improvement again in line with our initial thought. Where I guess you're going to start seeing in terms of margin evolution some more positive impact, this is on the revenue -- sorry, SG&A to revenue ratio where we have seen a deterioration in Q1. I think I'm not saying that we will have SG&A growing at a lower pace than revenue in Q2, but I expect the growth of SG&A in Q2 to be closer to the revenue and therefore that will weight less on the operating income margin. But that's really what you should expect in terms of sequence for the year. Again, we expect very nice acceleration for the top line just confirming the nice momentum that we are experiencing in the business and we have this ramp-up on the margin that is coming progressively. It's going to show up first at the level of the SG&A on revenue. And in H2, we are expecting as we said a better evolution of the gross margin rate. So far, we're just confirming initial expectations. Yes. I'm not going to say that we don't see any pressure on the consumer in the world. It is quite obvious and of course you are not talking about the U.S., which -- maybe you could deserve a separate comment. But it is clear that in countries such as the Philippines, for instance, we see some impact on the business coming from purchasing power. I think we see some of that as well in Indonesia. So they are markets where there was already some pressure on purchasing power particularly leading to some downtrading and that has continued to play as we progress through the beginning of 2023. But I have to say that in many markets, we haven't seen clear signs so far. We have to stay very cautious of course of pressure on the consumer all your massive downtrading. We don't see that. The Marlboro market share was a bit down, but I don't think that is clearly reflecting at that stage a pressure on the premium product of our portfolio. And we've been increasing price as you have seen in a very significant manner. Of course, competition not immediately or not totally responding to our price increase that can have an impact on our market share, but I would say so far, we have the feeling that in a highly inflationary environment, the consumer is ticking as normal and is not seeing as an issue to see also price increase on his tobacco product. Thank you. Good morning, Gaurav. Yes, Gaurav. So I think you rightly pointed to the ruble actually, if you are not going to disclose currency by currency, but if you look at the ruble, just the ruble is more than the net impact of $0.30 that today we are anticipating for the year. So I think it shows a very strong impact of the ruble. And the Egyptian pound continue to devaluate after January. So it's -- I'm not sure we had the full impact of the Egyptian pound. And actually, if you accumulate ruble and the Egyptian pound, you have 80% of the net impact of $0.30, it's a net impact. Don't get me wrong because you have also the yen that is quite negative. And then you have the euro and a number of other categories that is positive. But I think with the ruble and the Egyptian pound, you have a pretty good explanation of the net impact. I hope it's helpful. Gaurav, I cannot -- and I will have to consider that I'm not the greatest specialist of the U.S. consumer for combustible cigarettes. So I wonder myself to given an analysis. I think it's in line with my previous comment on the fact that so far, we have been a pretty good resistance from the consumer to same price increase and coping with inflation in Europe. I'm not able to tell you why there is a difference here. We know that the social model in Europe is different. You may have some more protection, some more safety needs that are playing and maybe limiting the impact of inflation. There was maybe more compensation given from various government on trying to fight again energy price increase and sometimes compensating of agricultural product inflation across a number of geographies. So that can be one element to explain why the European consumer is resisting better. But I'm not going to pretend that I have the perfect answer to your question. Thank you. Good morning, Pamela. Again, I'm going to try to go as far as I can, as you can imagine, some of that is super sensitive, so we're not going to share in detail what we are investing and where. First of all, trying to give you perspective for the full-year, we believe we're going to have our SG&A growing faster than revenue organically. But nevertheless, we expect a limited discrepancy between the two. So that means that as we progress through 2023, you should expect the growth of our SG&A to converge with the top line growth, I'm speaking here organic. And Q1 is really, I would say, impacted by a number of one-off both, by the way, on the basis of comparison, if you look at our Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 numbers last year, sequentially, you will see that Q1 was very low, both because we did not invest at the same moment of the year. So there is a phasing in investment and also because there was some one-off positive last year, so don't take Q1 as a reference. Having said that, we are facing inflation, of course, in our SG&A. It's a lot of people cost. And of course, we are increasing salaries. But we're also indeed generating some efficiency. So that is giving us some leeway to invest on our priority. It's about, of course, commercial investment on our priority, as you can expect. So it's everything on marketing commercial to boost IQOS. That is, of course, a big driver. It is the investment that we are making to prepare the U.S. We talk about the investment that we are making in Wellness and Healthcare. We continue to innovate a lot. We have innovation in the pipe for all our smoke-free product. And of course, that is also having some impact. So that is really what is driving this growth, and we continue to see as important this capacity that we have to cope with inflation, to invest for the future and at the same time, to have an SG&A evolution that thanks to the dynamism of the business is allowing us to still generate nice operating income and net profit growth. That's what I can share with you. Look, I think we've already been clear that while we were clearly developing some offering on the vaping category, this was not our priority. We had IQOS. And now I would say we are even more taken by two priorities, which are IQOS and ZYN. When you have such a fantastic team and the potential that they have to deliver very strong top line growth, volume growth, revenue growth and in a very nicely profitable fashion, that's really the priority. I guess you listened to us at CAGNY and we expressed the questioning that we have on the vaping category today, which are around the absence of clear regulation in many country. The fact that, that is giving way to an appropriate marketing activities, risk of underage consumption. And also the fact that this is a category where so far it's difficult. I'm not saying impossible, but difficult to see a lot of profitable model being developed. And therefore, that is pushing us to look at that and continue to work on this category and the fact that we are coming with this evolution of the range, I think, is just in line with the fact that the technology is evolving. We see the customer needs evolving as well, that's why we are developing VEEV now. But we're going to be focused. So it's not going to be across geography. It's going to be where the vaping category is relevant. It's going to be where we have a differentiation where we have the commercial strength to make an impact. And I think it is a much better strategy to do that, develop a few successes instead of exhausting ourselves in trying to develop something global today, when we don't see necessarily the ingredient of the driver for that to happen in an interesting manner, both in terms of growth, top line and bottom line progression. Thank you. Good morning, Vivien. So it does not because, of course, we don't have any idea of what it could be, when it could happen. So these are really an average that we take on the spot in the day before the announcement and not taking any kind of forward-looking or whatever consensus for currency evolution. You have a lot of people today that believe that the euro is set for a nice wide against the dollar in the coming months. Frankly, we're not betting on any kind of possible evolution, but really just working on the spot. Well, Vivien, I think what I can share with you is that I believe Q1 is just the bright confirmation of what we said, i.e., Swedish Match is coming with a very nicely accretive impact to the PMI growth. It is true for the volume, it is true for the revenue, and it is true for the profitability. So indeed, ZYN growing in the U.S. very nicely, and I don't come back on this north of 30% growth without the impact of California. That is driving a business that is nicely profitable, that is itself accretive to the Swedish Match average business. And therefore, of course, to PMI. And it is just very good news to have this engine for growth. Frankly, I mean, I don't want to repeat myself, but IQOS and ZYN together, that just a very exciting pair, and ZYN is coming as a very nice top line and margin enhancement role, and we expect that to continue. Thank you. Hi, Andrei. Well, they are very material, but we flagged that. And I think once again, we explained that in Q1, and we expect that to continue in Q2. This big increase in energy price, leaf price, acetate tow is going to be the biggest driver for the pressure on the gross margin. Now as we enter the second-half of the year and notably towards the end of the year, we believe that these elements will be -- well, first of all, will be facing already with some of the bad news in H2. So of course, the period-on-period comparison will be, of course, easier. And then we keep working on productivity. We may keep working on our COGS to see all optimization. So this negative pressure and nothing is going to disappear, but it's going to ease versus what we are experiencing in H1. But I would expect in Q2, the pressure to remain very strong at that level. Yes, I believe that with Swedish Match, we have the biggest specialist, super-focused, knowledgeable player of the oral nicotine category. So we've been adding to that amazing skill, the 13 -- you may remember that we bought this company that is specialized in formulation of product some of them, including nicotine, and that can also come with very nice innovation in the form factors. So you should expect us. Of course, don't expect me to come down with detail, but you should certainly expect us to come with nice innovation. There is certainly the appetite in some area from the consumer to try new things, new [Indiscernible] with product to develop this oral nicotine category in other spaces, probably the consumer doesn't know as well what can be done, so it's for us, it's our duty to come and make some proposal. But I guess you can expect us, and I think we demonstrate that PMI and now in the PMI per Swedish Match to be leading innovation in this category as well in the future. Thank you. Hi, Matt. Thank you. So yes, we are close to 1 million additional IQOS user in Q1. It's a nice number. It's not something that we can beat. I think that there is opportunity to further accelerate as we continue in Q2 and beyond. But first of all, I would like to have a few words of cautiousness. It's not a scientific number, that's an estimate, and that can have some variation depending on the number of elements. But I think, directionally, it is correct, and I think it shows the very strong momentum of IQOS. It is confirmed, of course, by the consumer offtake that we've been describing. It is clear that ILUMA is helping this conversion. So what we see with ILUMA is a higher capacity to convince smokers, because it is a more seamless experience. There is no cleaning. It is even closer the ritual of the combustible cigarettes. The overall experience is more satisfying. So the abandonment rate is lower. And of course, we talk about net user acquisition, so that is also helping. We have very nice progression of the consumer satisfaction in all countries. That is -- I guess, probably supporting the lower abandonment. So it is clear that the more we go for ILUMA, the more we are in the capacity to accelerate conversion. Japan, I think -- I mean, we're coming with a number in Japan and you can build the history. I think Japan is providing a lot of interesting information, because it took some time. I mean the acceleration that we have since Q3 in Japan is quite spectacular, frankly, and probably goes beyond our expectation. But it shows that ILUMA is probably -- gradually getting traction with, I don't know, it's a word of mouth. And -- but the consumer is realizing that this is making a big impact. And frankly, the acceleration of the market share to north of 26%, and I'm not talking about Tokyo, but average Japanese market share is a significant acceleration. It started in Q4, but it accelerated, and it's one year after the launch. So it shows that not everything is happening in the first quarter of the launch. I think we're showing a number of chart here showing that. And that bodes well for a nice ramp up in the coming quarters as not only do we have to start to launch ILUMA in a number of countries, but we know that this positive effect will spread over the coming quarters. So we take that as a nice driver for user acquisition growth in the coming quarters. Yes. Well, that's the additional investment. But of course, we are already starting with some investment in the U.S. We'll come at the time of the Investor Day in September with detailed plan on how we intend to grow IQOS in the U.S. And at that time, of course, we share much more color on the level of investment that we believe is going to be necessary. I think the important message, because we have a lot of questions here is the fact that, yes, of course, in order to express what we think is a great potential of IQOS in the U.S., investment will be needed. By the way, we've been investing to build this phenomenal business for IQOS in Japan and Europe. I mean we've been investing. It didn't come by chance. So we will invest in the U.S. But what we are seeing is that, given the growth momentum that we have in the business, we think that investing in the U.S. behind IQOS will, first of all, provide even more momentum on the top line and that we can absorb this investment, while continuing to grow the bottom line very nicely. We're not ready to compromise on bottom line growth because of investment that we need to make in the U.S. If I want to repeat something that I said already, I think the question mark will be, what is the differential that we can generate between top line growth and bottom line growth? Remember, the last algorithm was 5% and 9%, above 5%, above 9%. Well, if we increase more than 5% the gross rate perspective, it doesn't mean that we're going to keep a 4 points of difference between top line growth and bottom line growth. That's the sense of the comments. I hope it's helpful. Thank you. Thanks, Jared, for the question. Well, first of all, yes, we are, of course, extremely pleased with the performance of ZYN in the U.S. And I want to pay a tribute to the work that the team is doing there, which is absolutely fantastic. No, I don't think that there is yet a sizable impact coming from our investment in the U.S. I think it's being developed on the merit of the great commercial plan and action. The brand has amazing traction. I think that it's extremely highly regarded by the consumer premium brand, a very nice franchise. And they are building on these two drivers, as explained, one geography. The other one is consumption per store. We just show that two things. One, of course, we have enriched the full geographical coverage. And that's where probably in the coming quarters, you will see some acceleration as we're going to put more feet in the street and more capacity to visit retail stores. And the other thing is that there is a growing knowledge, understanding and appetite for the category and for ZYN that epitomes the category, and that's what we are seeing. So, so far, no really increased investment behind the natural increase when you have such a nice growth, of course, increase investment year-on-year. So we do increase investment in the U.S., but nothing, kind of, at the stage accelerated plan and not yet impact coming from investment on IQOS that should come in the future. Thank you. Yes, absolutely. So indeed, Q1 has not been great in terms of cash flow performance. But that was, again, expected. That is linked with the timing of shipments, excise duty payment and some of the working capital. And there was nothing surprising. I mean, I would prefer to see higher operating cash generation in Q1, but that was expected. And we are absolutely confirming the objective for the year of an operating cash flow between $10 billion to $11 billion. No, I don't think it was in the release. I don't know whether we'll communicate that. But I mean, you can come to it. I'm not sure to understand fully what your question I think you have the data to calculate things, but you can come back to us and we'll see whether we can show where the information is available. No, I think you're alluding to the fact that we concluded 2022 saying, well, we are around 2.9 times, but of course, that would be lower and significantly lower. And maybe about what you are seeing here, if you were to take the full-year of Swedish Match. You're most welcome. Thank you all. Talk to you soon. Thank you. Bye-bye."

It is now my pleasure to introduce Emmanuel Babeau, our Chief Financial Officer. Over to you, Emmanuel.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, James, and welcome everyone. Following an excellent first half we delivered another outstanding performance in Q3. All key elements of the business performed at or above expectations, driving strong double-digit organic top and bottom-line growth, margin expansion and a significant acceleration in adjusted diluted earnings per share growth in dollar terms. As expected, both IQOS and ZYN accelerated on a sequential basis. IQOS delivered a significant step-up in HTU adjusted IMS volumes in Q3, which is historically a quarter impacted negatively by seasonality. This reflects the strong underlying momentum of the business, with adjusted IMS close to plus 15% ahead versus prior year with another very strong performance from Japan, reaccelerating momentum in Europe, and promising results from a number of global markets. With ZYN, we continued our efforts to increase U.S. production capacity in response to strong demand, enabling stabilization of share performance followed by sequential improvement throughout the quarter. This led to a significant increase in sequential U.S. volumes, with over 40% year-on-year growth despite capacity constraints. Outside the U.S. nicotine pouch can volumes grew by close to 70%. Our combustibles business also accelerated to high single-digit net revenue and gross profit growth, led by further very strong pricing, resilient volumes and the benefits of our cost actions. Our overall Q3 performance epitomizes the soundness of our strategy, with underlying momentum across categories with strong volumes, pricing and smoke-free mix supported by cost efficiency measures. With double-digit growth in both adjusted operating income and diluted earnings per share in currency-neutral and dollar terms, we are raising our full-year guidance. Turning now to the headline financials for Q3. We delivered excellent organic revenue growth of plus 11.6%, driven by shipment volume growth of plus 2.9%, positive smoke-free category mix and pricing. The combination of this positive top-line performance with the additional favorable smoke-free mix impact on profits and ongoing cost efficiencies, enabled us to achieve growth of plus 13.8% in organic operating income and plus 18.0% in currency-neutral adjusted diluted earnings per share. This excludes an unfavorable currency impact of $0.06, notably due to weakness in the Egyptian Pound, Argentine Peso and the strong Swiss Franc, partly offset by the Japanese Yen. Despite the currency headwind, our proactive measures on pricing and accelerated cost initiatives drove plus 11.2% dollar growth in adjusted operating income and plus 14.4% dollar growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share to a record $1.91. This better-than-expected earnings delivery reflects IQOS and ZYN shipment volumes at the higher end of our expectations and a very strong combustibles performance. In addition we benefitted from a lower net financing cost, including increased interest income as well as mark-to-market gains on derivatives that we use to manage the currency profile of our debt, driven by interest rate volatility. Combined with an excellent H1, this yields an impressive plus 17.2% year-to-date currency-neutral growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share, with double-digit organic top-line growth and 190 basis points of organic opening income margin expansion. Including currency, we delivered adjusted earnings per share growth of close to plus 8% which is a testament to our continued focus on delivering strong performance in dollar terms. Let\u2019s turn to the Q3 financial performance by category, with both sides of the business producing excellent results. Smoke-free net revenues and gross profit grew organically by plus 16.8% and plus 20.2% respectively, driving 200 basis points of gross margin expansion. This reflects a robust IQOS performance in the quarter including manufacturing productivities, as well as the continued accretion of ZYN and a small but growing contribution from VEEV. Smoke-free gross margins were more than 450 basis points higher than combustibles in Q3 and more than 200 basis points higher year-to-date. Combustible net revenue and gross profit growth accelerated to almost plus 9% organically. Combustible gross margins improved by plus 10 basis points organically and by plus 20 basis points in dollar terms, marking the second quarter of expansion following a challenging 2023. We continue to target combustible gross margin expansion for the year in organic and dollar terms as cost pressures, including the impact of the EU single-use plastics directive, are more than offset by pricing and ongoing cost initiatives. Focusing now on volumes, we are well on track for our fourth consecutive year of volume growth. Our business delivered a remarkable performance of around plus 3% total shipment growth both in Q3 and year-to-date, with all categories and all four regions growing over both periods. Q3 HTU adjusted IMS growth of plus 14.8% reflects the underlying dynamism of our IQOS business, with a continued strong performance in Japan and a reacceleration in Europe as expected. Q3 HTU shipments of 35.3 billion units were at the upper end of our expectations, with the superior adjusted in-market sales growth compared to shipments due to shipment phasing, as highlighted in H1. Our oral smoke-free business grew Q3 shipment volumes by plus 22.2%, with ZYN powering U.S. growth of plus 41.4% and very strong international performance. Our VEEV e-vapor business exhibited continued volume momentum in the quarter, reaching the equivalent of 1.2 billion units on year-to-date basis. Q3 cigarette shipments grew by plus 1.3%, outpacing the total estimated international cigarette industry excluding China and the U.S. at plus 0.5%. The unusually resilient industry performance this year reflects growing volumes in markets where smoke-free products are not permitted such as Turkey, India and Brazil, alongside a reduction in illicit volumes in a number of markets driven partly by geopolitical factors. Our growth includes notable contributions from Turkey, India and Italy and reflects good category share performance despite robust pricing. Our exceptional Q3 revenue performance reflected our three structural pillars of top-line growth: volumes, pricing, and smoke-free mix shift. Building on our very robust volume growth, pricing contributed plus 7.5 points of growth. This was powered by strong combustibles pricing of plus 9.7%, plus 3% pricing for IQOS HTUs and a notable contribution from ZYN. The positive mix impact of our smoke-free business delivered plus 1.4 points despite the strong growth of combustibles, given the higher net revenue per unit of both IQOS and ZYN. As in prior quarters, geographic mix was negative but to a lesser degree as growth stepped-up in Europe and the U.S. The year-to-date net revenue drivers were very similar, with double-digit organic top-line growth built on positive volumes, smoke-free category mix of more than plus 2 points and strong pricing. Turning to operating income, we delivered impressive Q3 organic margin expansion of plus 90 basis points, and plus 110 basis points in dollar terms. Gross margins increased organically by 80 basis points, and by plus 70 basis points in dollar terms. This was again driven by our higher margin smoke-free business, pricing and ongoing productivity savings across the value chain. Moving now to SG&A. Despite a planned step-up in commercial activity, our organic cost evolution was essentially in line with top-line growth, with plus 40 basis points of margin expansion in adjusted dollar terms supported by cost efficiency actions. As previously communicated, we target an organic increase in SG&A below the rate of net revenue growth for the year, while still supporting our smoke-free expansion with continued commercial investment. We delivered an incremental $180 million in gross cost efficiencies in Q3 reaching almost $490 million year-to-date, with initiatives notably focused on manufacturing and back-office costs. While only the first year, we are progressing nicely towards our 2024-2026 target of $2 billion in gross savings. On a year-to-date basis, our adjusted operating income margin evolution was also very positive with plus 190 basis points organic expansion and plus 40 basis points in dollar terms. We are well set to meet our full-year objective of expansion on both bases. Turning now to our IQOS business, which is celebrating the ten-year anniversary of its first launches in Japan and Italy. IQOS is the world\u2019s leading smoke-free product, generating over $10 billion in annual net revenues. Notwithstanding the incredible growth and success of the brand over that time, there is a very substantial growth runway over the coming years as more of the world\u2019s one billion legal-age smokers switch to better alternatives. Indeed, robust growth continues this year. We spoke last quarter about our expectation for a strong H2 delivery, with continued user growth momentum supported by our commercial programs, including events to celebrate the 10-year milestone. As expected, Q3 momentum accelerated with plus 14.8% year-on-year growth in HTU adjusted IMS and a very substantial sequential step-up of 1.8 billion units versus Q2, which is especially impressive in a quarter that is typically negatively impacted by seasonality. This reflects a return to double-digit growth in Europe, a continued excellent trajectory in Japan, and a further acceleration from our global markets. We expect further strong growth in Q4. The success of IQOS is built on technology, commercial capabilities, brand-building and innovation on both devices and consumables. Following the successful launch of the IQOS ILUMA i device in Japan earlier this year, we are expanding the rollout to more markets, including Italy, Greece, Portugal, Romania and Switzerland. Focusing now on IQOS in Europe, I am pleased to report a Q3 reacceleration in adjusted IMS growth to plus 11.3% following a slower Q2 progression. This includes the resumption of growth in markets passing through the adjustment phase of the characterizing flavor ban. The majority of EU HTU volume is now covered by the ban, and we observe a return to robust growth in markets such as Greece, Romania, and Portugal. Following the stronger-than-expected initial impact in Q2, we are pleased to report positive volume momentum in Italy. This was supported by the launch of recent HTU variants, including our mainstream-priced offering DELIA, and tobacco-free LEVIA, jointly accounting for close to 7% of Italy\u2019s HTU offtake three months from launch. In addition, we see excellent momentum in markets such as Germany, Spain and the UK, and increasingly balanced growth across markets overall, regardless of IQOS penetration. Regional Q3 adjusted HTU share was up by +0.8 points year-on-year to 9.5%, and modestly lower sequentially due to the typical impact of seasonally higher combustible volumes in the summer. HTU adjusted IMS volumes reached 13.2 billion units on a four-quarter moving average, maintaining our high share of the category with robust sequential growth. Looking at our key city offtake shares in Europe, we see continued rapid progress in a large number of cities. An increasing number are posting growth of over 2.0 points year-on-year, which is the most meaningful comparison given seasonal factors. Particular callouts include Budapest, Athens, Bratislava, Bucharest, London and Amsterdam. Turning now to Japan, we delivered our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit progression with adjusted HTU IMS growth of plus 14%, reaching 10.9 billion units on a four-quarter moving average. Our commercial programs continue to drive meaningful results, with innovation on devices and consumables propelling a +3.2 point market share increase to 29.8% in Q3 and surpassing the landmark of 30% in September. This includes the impact of the IQOS ILUMA i device, which was launched in Q1 and delivers enhanced consumer satisfaction. As shown on the previous slide, IQOS HTU offtake shares in key cities such as Tokyo continue to advance rapidly. We have previously flagged that Tokyo offtake share for the overall heat-not-burn category reached 50% earlier this year. This is also now true in eight cities overall including Yokohama, Kawasaki, Sendai and Fukuoka, with several others rapidly approaching the same milestone. This is clearly a positive sign of the enduring growth potential in a market with already high penetration. Taking a more global view, we continue to see very good growth across a number of global markets, as highlighted by key city offtake shares. These include cities in Saudi Arabia, Mexico, and Egypt, where Cairo reached close to 10% share. Offtake share of more than 5% in Jakarta is indicative of the strong acceleration in Indonesia, as we continue our geographic and portfolio expansion, including a growing offer of clove TEREA HTU variants. Finally, I would like to call out duty-free, where the ongoing travel recovery combined with the strength of our multicategory portfolio delivered dynamic growth, with ZYN and VEEV increasingly offered alongside IQOS. Moving now to ZYN, the number one U.S. smoke-free brand continues to see very strong underlying momentum. As flagged previously, we are working to progressively increase our production volumes, and this was reflected in a sequential acceleration to 149 million cans shipped in Q3. As we continued working through these supply constraints, ZYN\u2019s category share stabilized and then resumed growth on a sequential basis through the quarter, despite a further $0.15 per can list price increase taken at the start of September. We continue to expect shipments to match consumer demand at some point during the fourth quarter. While gauging the level of underlying demand is not an exact science in the current circumstances, our promotional and commercial activity has naturally been lower as we prioritize meeting existing consumer needs over growing the legal-age user base from other nicotine categories. With ongoing efforts to increase our U.S. production capacity to around 900 million cans for the full year of 2025, and significant expansion beyond 2025 from our planned new facility in Colorado, we believe we are well positioned to capture ZYN\u2019s potential over the coming years. We remain committed to driving industry standards in under-21 prevention, with policies and initiatives designed to prevent youth access. Our robust U.S. marketing code prohibits social media influencers and we refuse requests for such partnerships. All our owned product websites use age verification technology and we partner with WeCard and TruAge to support age restriction checks for retail sales. Overall, we are encouraged by the results of our efforts, which I\u2019ll come back to. Combatting trade in illicit tobacco and nicotine products remains a top priority, and we dedicate a significant level of resources to support these efforts. We have strong governance and supply chain controls in place, and we take appropriate action where necessary, including limiting and/or terminating sales to certain customers in both the online and traditional trade, and we are continuously improving these control measures. We also closely monitor imports of products which may be illicit or infringing our patents and are committed to act on our own or in conjunction with the authorities to prevent these products being illegally commercialized. Our multicategory approach continues to gain momentum, as we leverage the strength of our leading brands whilst expanding the reach of our smoke-free portfolio. For nicotine pouches, we are focused on responsibly building the category with ZYN in international markets. Increasing category awareness and interest among legal-age nicotine users is driving positive traction in a growing number of geographies. We have increased ZYN\u2019s presence year-on-year to 30 markets, including the Philippines, Mexico, several European markets as well as within duty-free. Despite still-limited distribution in some markets, we see continued strong traction in Mexico, Pakistan, South Africa, the UK and duty-free. The category also continues to grow robustly in Scandinavia. E-vapor performance remained dynamic in Q3, and we reached profitability at product contribution level in September on the back of excellent volume momentum and cost of good sold improvements. Europe is at the forefront, as closed pods continue to take share from disposables and we lead the category with our flagship VEEV ONE closed-pod system in several markets, including Italy, Romania and the Czech Republic. We are seeing good repeat-purchase and regular usage within a competitive environment, as we continue to build distribution and brand awareness. Outside Europe, we are investing behind VEEV for future profitability in a number of focus markets. We are underway with the first stage of our IQOS 3 consumer pilots in the U.S., with the launch of our \u201cBe the first\u201d campaign in Austin, Texas. As explained previously, the focus is on adult consumer engagement, building awareness through category and brand education in legal-age smoker communities. We do not anticipate any commercial volumes in 2024. The learnings from these pilots in Austin and other cities will be used to fine-tune our approach in anticipation of the at-scale launch of IQOS ILUMA, where we continue to assume an FDA authorization in H2, 2025. Finally, a brief comment on our Wellness & Healthcare business. As we disclosed in September, we have entered into an agreement to sell Vectura Group and expect the transaction to close by the end of the year. Our ownership of Vectura was important to develop the required skill and scientific expertise to advance our inhaled therapeutics pipeline. Significant progress has been made on this front, however given that Vectura\u2019s scientific engagement and commercial CDMO relationships were being impacted by unwarranted opposition to PMI\u2019s ownership, we believe the overall future of Vectura will be better served under its new ownership. Together with the divestment, we announced the establishment of master service agreements to support the continued development of our inhaled therapeutics proprietary pipeline. Our Wellness & Healthcare strategy continues, and we look forward to updating you on future developments, including launches of consumer wellness products. Moving now to combustibles, where our portfolio delivered a very strong financial performance. Net revenues grew +8.6%, driven by Q3 pricing of +9.7%. This includes pricing taken during the quarter as we continue to focus on value maximization, and was led by markets such as Egypt, Turkey and Germany. As covered earlier this drove a very robust +8.7% increase in gross profit. With better-than-expected pricing of +8.8% on a year-to-date basis, we now forecast full-year pricing of +8 to +9%. Cigarette volumes were resilient, as global industry trends remain benign. As I touched on earlier, this can be largely attributed to markets where smoke-free products are not allowed or are early in their development, as well as the impact of significant industry efforts and geopolitical factors on global illicit trade in a number of markets. Our cigarette category share grew by +0.1 points in Q3 and year-to-date. Both Marlboro and our overall global brands achieved their highest quarterly share since the 2008 spin-off, with a corresponding positive impact on value share. As announced last week, there has been some long-awaited progress towards resolution of the decades-old cigarette-related litigation claims in Canada. Our Canadian affiliate RBH was deconsolidated in 2019 after entering the mediated CCAA process. The mediator\u2019s proposed plan would entail a settlement of around $23.5 billion for the industry, payable from cash and cash equivalents in Canada and future combustible profits in Canada. The reconsolidation of RBH\u2019s financial results after the plan is implemented would be subject to the final terms of the Proposed Plan and U.S. GAAP. We estimate reconsolidation would be incremental to PMI\u2019s cash and cash equivalent, cash flow and adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income, and adjusted EPS numbers. I direct you to last week\u2019s press release for further details. Moving now to sustainability. We are making continued strong progress towards our product transformation targets, including on access to smoke-free products. Our smoke-free products are now available in 92 markets, placing us on track for our aspiration of 100 by 2025. As a reminder, there remain a notable number of markets where smoke-free products are not yet available due to regulatory constraints, which in the case of heated tobacco make up close to one fifth of industry volumes excluding China, as covered at our Investor Day last year. We are also moving nicely towards our objective for low and middle-income countries to comprise over 50% of smoke-free products markets. Our efforts to increase access to smoke-free products are specific to legal-age nicotine users and tackling underage nicotine use is a critical area of focus. We are encouraged by the results of the U.S. 2024 National Youth Tobacco Survey, which reported youth usage of nicotine pouches remains very low at less than 2%, with no statistically significant change year-on-year despite the strong growth of the overall category. Such results can only be achieved through responsible stewardship of the category, and we are committed to continue driving standards in youth access prevention through a multi-stakeholder approach. Addressing our company\u2019s environmental impacts is another key pillar of our sustainability strategy. We are working towards carbon neutrality in our direct operations, including certification of all our manufacturing facilities as carbon neutral. Year-to-date, we certified four additional sites, bringing us to a total of 52%. We have concrete plans for the remainder of our footprint in order to achieve the 100% aspiration by 2025. Additionally, we are progressing with the Alliance for Water Stewardship standard, certifying one additional factory year-to-date to place us at 86% against our goal of 100% by 2025. Combining our ongoing initiatives to address our environmental impacts with robust and rigorous reporting processes, we believe we are well-prepared for upcoming reporting requirements, including the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. Okay. Turning now to our outlook for the full year. Following this stronger than expected year-to-date performance, we are raising our full-year volume, organic sales growth, organic OI growth and bottom-line currency-neutral and U.S. dollar forecasts. First to volumes, where we target record organic growth and increase our outlook to +2% to +3% total shipment progression. Within this, we continue to expect adjusted IMS HTU volume growth of around +13% and shipment volumes of around 140 billion. This forecast continues to assume an impact from the EU characterizing flavor ban of just over 2 billion units and no volumes in Taiwan, where we continue to await regulatory approval. For U.S. ZYN we forecast shipment volumes at the upper end of our prior guidance, in the range of 570 million cans to 580 million cans, reflecting the progress made on capacity expansion as well as continued strong demand. Our outlook also factors in a robust combustibles performance, driven by a resilient total category as previously outlined. Given the combination of stronger volumes with accelerated pricing and continued smoke-free mix, we are increasing our forecast organic net revenue growth to around +9.5%. This includes strong double-digit organic growth in smoke-free net revenue and should result in close to $15 billion in total for the year. With the impact of this improved top-line performance, coupled with IQOS and ZYN operating leverage and further cost efficiencies, we now also raise our forecast adjusted organic OI growth to +14% to +14.5% for the year. We continue to target adjusted gross margin expansion for both smoke-free products and combustibles, and adjusted OI margin expansion for total PMI, all in both organic and dollar terms. Accordingly, we are raising our forecast for currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth to +14% to +15%, which also factors in lower-than-anticipated net financing costs, including higher interest income. This translates into a range of $6.45 to $6.51, including an unfavorable currency impact of $0.40 for the year at prevailing rates. The $0.06 increase in expected currency headwind largely reflects the same factors as Q3. On a U.S. dollar basis, this forecast represents very robust growth of approximately +7% to +8%. As reflected in this forecast we expect another robust delivery in Q4, despite a more challenging top-line comparison on the mix of shipments between categories. We also target another quarter of adjusted gross and operating margin expansion, including a planned increase in commercial investments behind our smoke-free brands. Q4 net financing costs are likely to be sequentially higher, notably given the mark-to-market benefit in Q3 from the volatility in interest rate markets I mentioned earlier. Our expectations for strong operating cash flow of around $11 billion for the year are unchanged, and factoring in the most recent currency moves we now target a 0.3 times to 0.4times improvement in our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio in 2024. This places us well on track for our target ratio of around two times by the end of 2026, with buybacks to be considered, subject to Board approval, once we are within sight of this goal. In conclusion, we delivered another outstanding quarter reflecting the strong underlying momentum of our business coupled with our proactive steps to support superior growth in dollar term. We are delivering on all key metrics, with best-in-class volume and pricing, in addition to substantial margin expansion and earnings growth on both a reported and dollar basis. We are raising our growth outlook for an exceptional 2024, with growth rates comfortably above our 2024-2026 targets. While the industry dynamics affecting combustible volumes may be specific to 2024, the key drivers of our growth are both structural and sustainable. Legal-age smokers are looking for smoke-free alternatives and we are building strong and profitable premium brands with IQOS, ZYN and VEEV to lead the smoke-free category. As we continue our powerful smoke-free transformation we have significant further opportunities both in the U.S. and internationally. Importantly, we raised our dividend in September for the 17th successive year, in line with our progressive policy. We retain a strong and growing cash generation profile, which enables both reinvestment in long-term growth and the capacity for substantial shareholder returns. Thank you very much for your attention, and we are now very happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you. Hi Emmanuel hope you are well?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Good morning, Bonnie.\nBonnie Herzog: I have a question on IQOS. I wonder if you could maybe comment a little bit further on the expected volume trajectory for IQOS, shipment volume growth did decelerate to the high single-digit range in Q3 from double-digit history. So I know there were some timing impacts and seasonality. But just could you maybe update us a little bit further on that in the quarter than maybe how that will reverse in Q4. And then also hoping for more color on volume, IQOS volume that is in East Asia, which has also decelerated just the drivers of that and whether you expect shipments to improve in the region in Q4?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Sure, Bonnie, with pleasure, and you\u2019re giving me the opportunity to maybe be back on the fact that when you look at IQOS, I really urge you to watch at the in-market sales, the adjusted in-market sales, which is the best proxy we can have from consumer off-take. And on that indicator, the good news was the confirmation of the reacceleration that we were expecting and we have been flagging the fact that we\u2019re expecting accelerated momentum on IQOS in H2. And we are indeed seeing that in our Q3 adjusted in-market sales because we are almost at 15%. You were asking the question about East Asia. Actually, Japan delivered again around 14% of adjusted in-market sales. So the market for IQOS remain extremely dynamic despite the fact that we have, of course, already close to 30% market share, but we continue with strong double-digit, and that was a very good news. What happened in Q3 to explain the acceleration is, as I said, continued very strong dynamism in Japan. By the way, South Korea is also doing well. And we \u2013 I think we are showing the number in Seoul where we are nicely growing the market share. Then there was a reacceleration in Europe. And I know that we received a lot of questions, okay, how confident can you be in the fact that Europe is going to reaccelerate. We knew that we were going through this transition phase for the flavor ban. And we see the market progressively exiting the disruption of the ban with the reacceleration. Italy was, of course, during the third quarter, the country with the reacceleration and that was nice to see Italy clearly restarting on a very strong foot, the growth on IQOS. And we resumed double-digit growth on adjusted AMS in Europe in Q3. And then you have a number of other markets in the world. And I would say we see momentum here building up, which is very good news for the future. I could mention, of course, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, I think EU here as well. I mean, we see a number of markets where there is \u2013 and of course, Egypt, but Egypt has been now for more than a year with growth, where we see real momentum emerging behind IQOS which, of course, we\u2019re just at the beginning. So a lot of potential but that is very encouraging on the fact that we have nice growth relay outside Japan and EU for the future. So that\u2019s really what we\u2019ve seen in Q3. Now you have the question on the shipment. Well, we\u2019ve been flagging the fact that shipment would be \u2013 trajectory would be disconnected from the consumer off-take. We had some very strong growth in the first two quarters, which was notably driven by comparison year-on-year. There was, of course, a Red Sea disruption that generated some shipments in the first part of the year. And therefore, today, we have shipments that are a bit lower for the third quarter than the adjusted IMS. And we\u2019re just, if you want, here for the nine months going to a situation where gradually, we are equalizing adjusted IMS and the shipments. So that\u2019s what we are seeing. And in Q4, we\u2019re going to be with more equalization because we\u2019re going to be facing two elements. The first one, regarding the Red Sea disruption, we\u2019re going to have some reversal in Q4, so that will play negatively on the shipment. And we also are facing some high comps last year as we are building inventory to prepare the transition for the flavor ban in Europe. So that\u2019s a high comps in time of shipments last year. But at the end of the day, you should expect adjusted IMS and shipments through a certain period to evolve in parallel way. And as we said, we continue to expect, for Q4, a renewed momentum on a consumer off-take or what we call adjusted market sales, which is really what matters. That\u2019s what is important because that\u2019s what is talking about the health of IQOS.\nBonnie Herzog: Yes. Okay. All of that makes sense and it\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. And then maybe a second question on ZYN. So the supply constraints appear to be easing, which is great. So I just wanted to confirm, Emmanuel, that you are on track to fully restore supply levels this quarter? Or is there a chance this bleeds into maybe early next year? And then when this happens, how quickly do you expect ZYN to recapture some of the lost market share? And just curious what role will potential stepped up promos play, I guess, if at all? How are you thinking about that? Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Sure. On ZYN, Bonnie, we said somewhere in Q4, we will have the supply to the market, meeting consumer demand, which to clarify again, doesn\u2019t mean that we will have fully been replenishing all level of inventory. Here at that point, we believe for what we can assess of the consumer demand that what we bring to the trade will correspond to what the consumer will take from the trade, will buy from the trade. But then there will certainly be \u2013 and I\u2019m not able to tell you what is going to happen during this quarter. But I think we are still in this perspective then, but that\u2019s probably more for 2025, there will be a replenishment of the out-of-stock situation. And we will gradually \u2013 but that\u2019s going to happen only gradually probably through 2025, put back the level of inventory to what it should be normally and that certainly will take some months as we continue to increase the capacity. Remember, we said that for the full year 2025, we are targeting an overall capacity of around 900 million can. Of course, that is a capacity that we are going to build gradually. It won\u2019t be there at the beginning of the year. And I would say the replenishment and being back to a fully normal situation is going to happen only gradually through 2025. And of course, when we can be more specific about that, we will be more specific with the topic. So that\u2019s for supply. When it comes to regaining share, so what we\u2019ve seen is that, in fact, when the availability of ZYN went down, we\u2019ve seen the category slowing down because, obviously, it seems that a number of buyer of ZYN are not intending to buy another brand. And therefore, when they don\u2019t find their ZYN, they are maybe producing or consuming something else. But that probably has been slowing down a bit the category. We will see how we gradually recover. We\u2019ve seen in the second part of the Q3, some improvement sequentially on our market share, which is good news. We believe that we have some positive outlook as we regain availability for the product, but it\u2019s difficult to be more specific than that at that stage.\nUnidentified Analyst: All right, thank you. I will pass it on.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Gaurav Jain with Barclays. Your line is open.\nGaurav Jain: Hi. Good morning, Emmanuel.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Good morning, Gaurav.\nGaurav Jain: A couple of questions from me. So just looking at the cigarette markets internationally, your pricing guidance, you have increased 8% to 9% and yet volumes are positive. The factors that you\u2019re mentioning why volumes are so strong, which is lack of SBD in Brazil and Turkey, lack of smuggling probably from Russia, Belarus, all these countries. They should continue in FY 2025. So shouldn\u2019t then FY 2025 also be a pretty strong year for cigarette volumes and pricing internationally. And within that context, can you also touch on if there are any disruptive excise tax hike happening in the next few months?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thanks, Gaurav, for your question. So I don\u2019t want to enter now into commenting 2025. And of course, in due course, we\u2019ll share with you on the outlook for the year. I think what we are seeing in 2024 is well-identified. We talk about a number of markets where smoke-free products are not allowed. Sometimes you have increasing the prevalence, sometimes you have demographics that are playing positively for the consumption of cigarettes. I think India is a clear market when it comes to demographic, for instance. And it\u2019s difficult to say how long all that is going to play and what\u2019s going to be the continuation of this trajectory. I think we need to be a bit cautious on the outlook, but it\u2019s true that I cannot say that everything will finish on the 31st of December 2024. So we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to be the trajectory in 2025. What is certainly good is to see that we are able to actually grow volume, grow share of segment and, at the same time, increase price in a very dynamic manner, which is a tribute to the strength of our brand, and it\u2019s true that the 9.7% in Q3 was a remarkable price increase. Don\u2019t take that for Q4 as a guidance, but that was very good in Q3. And that shows that in this category, where I think we\u2019ve been clear on our objective, which is really to maximize the performance on combustible in order to accompany and help the fastest transition to smoke-free. I think this strategy on combustible is working and delivering. And remember, we also said that in 2025, we expect a number of positive evolution for combustible cigarettes when it comes to cost of goods, where we\u2019ll have a lower level of headwinds. So there will be continuation of price increase in the future without a doubt. Nevertheless, don\u2019t take the 8% to 9% as the guidance for the future. We always said that we were more mid-single digits on the medium term. And we should see less headwind on cost of goods, which is probably good for the combustible cigarette profitability. On excise tax, at that stage, there is nothing really material I can report, I would say, traditional discussion, but we\u2019re still a bit early. You know that many, many decisions are made in November, if not in December, so probably we\u2019ll know more at the end of the year. But so far, I would say nothing specific or unusual to flag.\nGaurav Jain: Sure. Thank you. And my second question is on your e-cigarette comments. So what you told us is that you have shipped 1.2 billion sticks year-to-date. And if I understand correctly, you are using the conversion factor is 1 ml is 10 sticks. And if I assume 1 pod is 0.7 ml then you\u2019re shipping 160 million pods. So that would suggest that your e-cigarette revenue run rate is $300 million to $400 million, at which your contribution basis breakeven. So am I ballpark correct and all these numbers are done?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes, I can certainly confirm that 1 milliliter equates to 10 sticks, 10 cigarettes. That\u2019s the equivalent. And I would say that ballpark, I\u2019m not going to confirm exactly, but you are not million miles away from the reality on volumes. On revenue, I won\u2019t comment.\nGaurav Jain: Sure, thank you so much.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Faham Baig with UBS. Your line is open.\nFaham Baig: Hi, Emmanuel. Hi, James. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple from me, please. I want to start with vapor, particularly because one of your peers highlighted that in Europe vapor is seeing greater success in sort of fully converting smokers than heated tobacco. I know I\u2019ve asked this before, but I wanted to get your latest thoughts on this topic as well as whether you\u2019re seeing an acceleration in vapor adoption as you sort of roll out VEEV in several markets. And the second question goes back to nicotine pouches in the U.S. I noted in your prepared remarks, you\u2019ve also seen some illicit products coming into the market. Some of that may be infringing your patents. Could you just maybe expand on what measures you are currently taking or expect to take? And how do you think this will differ from the current environment we see in vapor in the U.S., please?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Sure, Faham. With pleasure. So on greater success from vaping in convincing smoker, we don\u2019t see any of that. The experience is very different. It\u2019s quite obvious that versus heat-not-burn, heating a liquid, which has no tobacco is delivering a very, very different experiences. And I think all markets are pointing to the fact that there is clearly a much, much higher and much better conversion from smokers to heat-not-burn into vaping. And I think the success of IQOS is brightly illustrating that, I have to say, I\u2019m not coming back on the performance on IQOS. I don\u2019t think we are really seeing an acceleration in the adoption of vaping. The vaping market, the vaping category is impacted today by many, many regulation evolution or potential evolution. We know that one of the problems of the vaping category is that you have a responsible player going for fancy flavor, unacceptable marketing behavior that can generate underage consumption that can be creating some disruption. We know that notably the disposable category has been generating some of that. But if you look at the \u2013 what we can say of the legal age nicotine user, I don\u2019t think that we can report any acceleration that would be meaningful from vaping. Regarding the nicotine part in the U.S., and your question on what we do, can you first allow me a general comment? I think that PMI is at the forefront, at the very forefront when it comes to fighting illicit trade. And that is true for the U.S., that is true everywhere in the world. We commit huge resources, I mean, investments in fighting illicit trade, working with authorities, regulators in many countries to do that. And for us, it\u2019s a very, very important battle, a very important fight. So, the U.S. make no exception. And yes, when we are aware of illicit, when we are aware of product infringing, potentially our patent, we are acting. I think that in my remarks, I signaled some of the things that we do. When we identified the sources that are potentially outside the U.S. we could go to even terminating sales to these sources. I said it. We are working with distributors. It can be informing, creating the awareness for illicit product writing to distributor. It can be sending cease and desist letter to distributor retail where we see an issue. And we do that on our own or working with the regulator, as I said, in the U.S. like everywhere in the world. So you can be sure that we take that extremely seriously.\nFaham Baig: Thanks, Emmanuel.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nPriya Ohri-Gupta: Hi Emmanuel, thank you so for receiving me.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Hi, great.\nPriya Ohri-Gupta: Just two quick ones from me. First, it does look like you modestly sort of took down the top end of your potential deleveraging for this year by a little bit if you could address sort of what drove that? And then secondly, you do have a fairly sizable amount of maturities over the course of 2025. Any thoughts on pulling some of that refinancing forward into the remainder of this year, just given where markets are opportunistically? Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes, taking these two questions with pleasure. So, on the slightly and very modestly narrowing the guidance for deleveraging, it\u2019s because of the euro strength at the end of September that was \u2013 because as you know, we have a significant part of the debt in euro and therefore, when the euro is going up versus the dollar, that can have a kind of one-off element because we always have this discrepancy between an EBIT that is calculated on an average rate for the year when the debt is going to be calculated on the spot on the 31 of December. So we\u2019ll see where we land. But the trajectory is clear. And you may have seen that at the end of the third quarter, we have generated cash flow of $8.2 billion, and that is simply $2.3 billion above the cash flow generation at the end of Q3 2023. So, we are highly generating cash, of course, on the back of a very strong momentum in the business, but that\u2019s good news. Yes, I mean, I am certainly not going to discard the possibility for us to be active on the refinancing market in the coming months. I am not going to elaborate now on that, and we have a number of options that are open to us. But you can be sure that we are already working on how to put in place the best refinancing again in the coming months for PMI.\nPriya Ohri-Gupta: Thank you so much.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gaurav Jain with Barclays. Your line is open.\nGaurav Jain: Guys, just a follow-up on the Canadian litigation settlement. Would these payments be tax-deductible? And when do you think something final will happen in this long run in sort of COVID case?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Gaurav. On the Canada litigation, so you have what we can say at that stage in our press release that we have issued last week. It\u2019s too preliminary. And as I said, I am not able to tell you whether it\u2019s going to be tax-deductible. Of course, as soon as we know we will let you know. But for the time being, I am not able to say. And as you may have seen in our release, where we shared what we can share at that stage, there are still a number of elements in this proposed solution put on the table by the mediators to be finalized. And of course, once we have the final terms, we will come back to you with this answer, of course, but also all the question on what\u2019s going to be the impact for PMI of a final settlement.\nGaurav Jain: Thank you so much.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to James Bushnell for closing remarks.\nJames Bushnell: Thank you for joining us today. Please reach out to the Investor Relations team if you have any follow-up questions. I am wishing you a good rest of the week and earnings season.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Look forward to speaking to you soon. Thank you. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Emmanuel Babeau",
            "content": "Thank you, James, and welcome everyone. Following an excellent first half we delivered another outstanding performance in Q3. All key elements of the business performed at or above expectations, driving strong double-digit organic top and bottom-line growth, margin expansion and a significant acceleration in adjusted diluted earnings per share growth in dollar terms. As expected, both IQOS and ZYN accelerated on a sequential basis. IQOS delivered a significant step-up in HTU adjusted IMS volumes in Q3, which is historically a quarter impacted negatively by seasonality. This reflects the strong underlying momentum of the business, with adjusted IMS close to plus 15% ahead versus prior year with another very strong performance from Japan, reaccelerating momentum in Europe, and promising results from a number of global markets. With ZYN, we continued our efforts to increase U.S. production capacity in response to strong demand, enabling stabilization of share performance followed by sequential improvement throughout the quarter. This led to a significant increase in sequential U.S. volumes, with over 40% year-on-year growth despite capacity constraints. Outside the U.S. nicotine pouch can volumes grew by close to 70%. Our combustibles business also accelerated to high single-digit net revenue and gross profit growth, led by further very strong pricing, resilient volumes and the benefits of our cost actions. Our overall Q3 performance epitomizes the soundness of our strategy, with underlying momentum across categories with strong volumes, pricing and smoke-free mix supported by cost efficiency measures. With double-digit growth in both adjusted operating income and diluted earnings per share in currency-neutral and dollar terms, we are raising our full-year guidance. Turning now to the headline financials for Q3. We delivered excellent organic revenue growth of plus 11.6%, driven by shipment volume growth of plus 2.9%, positive smoke-free category mix and pricing. The combination of this positive top-line performance with the additional favorable smoke-free mix impact on profits and ongoing cost efficiencies, enabled us to achieve growth of plus 13.8% in organic operating income and plus 18.0% in currency-neutral adjusted diluted earnings per share. This excludes an unfavorable currency impact of $0.06, notably due to weakness in the Egyptian Pound, Argentine Peso and the strong Swiss Franc, partly offset by the Japanese Yen. Despite the currency headwind, our proactive measures on pricing and accelerated cost initiatives drove plus 11.2% dollar growth in adjusted operating income and plus 14.4% dollar growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share to a record $1.91. This better-than-expected earnings delivery reflects IQOS and ZYN shipment volumes at the higher end of our expectations and a very strong combustibles performance. In addition we benefitted from a lower net financing cost, including increased interest income as well as mark-to-market gains on derivatives that we use to manage the currency profile of our debt, driven by interest rate volatility. Combined with an excellent H1, this yields an impressive plus 17.2% year-to-date currency-neutral growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share, with double-digit organic top-line growth and 190 basis points of organic opening income margin expansion. Including currency, we delivered adjusted earnings per share growth of close to plus 8% which is a testament to our continued focus on delivering strong performance in dollar terms. Let's turn to the Q3 financial performance by category, with both sides of the business producing excellent results. Smoke-free net revenues and gross profit grew organically by plus 16.8% and plus 20.2% respectively, driving 200 basis points of gross margin expansion. This reflects a robust IQOS performance in the quarter including manufacturing productivities, as well as the continued accretion of ZYN and a small but growing contribution from VEEV. Smoke-free gross margins were more than 450 basis points higher than combustibles in Q3 and more than 200 basis points higher year-to-date. Combustible net revenue and gross profit growth accelerated to almost plus 9% organically. Combustible gross margins improved by plus 10 basis points organically and by plus 20 basis points in dollar terms, marking the second quarter of expansion following a challenging 2023. We continue to target combustible gross margin expansion for the year in organic and dollar terms as cost pressures, including the impact of the EU single-use plastics directive, are more than offset by pricing and ongoing cost initiatives. Focusing now on volumes, we are well on track for our fourth consecutive year of volume growth. Our business delivered a remarkable performance of around plus 3% total shipment growth both in Q3 and year-to-date, with all categories and all four regions growing over both periods. Q3 HTU adjusted IMS growth of plus 14.8% reflects the underlying dynamism of our IQOS business, with a continued strong performance in Japan and a reacceleration in Europe as expected. Q3 HTU shipments of 35.3 billion units were at the upper end of our expectations, with the superior adjusted in-market sales growth compared to shipments due to shipment phasing, as highlighted in H1. Our oral smoke-free business grew Q3 shipment volumes by plus 22.2%, with ZYN powering U.S. growth of plus 41.4% and very strong international performance. Our VEEV e-vapor business exhibited continued volume momentum in the quarter, reaching the equivalent of 1.2 billion units on year-to-date basis. Q3 cigarette shipments grew by plus 1.3%, outpacing the total estimated international cigarette industry excluding China and the U.S. at plus 0.5%. The unusually resilient industry performance this year reflects growing volumes in markets where smoke-free products are not permitted such as Turkey, India and Brazil, alongside a reduction in illicit volumes in a number of markets driven partly by geopolitical factors. Our growth includes notable contributions from Turkey, India and Italy and reflects good category share performance despite robust pricing. Our exceptional Q3 revenue performance reflected our three structural pillars of top-line growth: volumes, pricing, and smoke-free mix shift. Building on our very robust volume growth, pricing contributed plus 7.5 points of growth. This was powered by strong combustibles pricing of plus 9.7%, plus 3% pricing for IQOS HTUs and a notable contribution from ZYN. The positive mix impact of our smoke-free business delivered plus 1.4 points despite the strong growth of combustibles, given the higher net revenue per unit of both IQOS and ZYN. As in prior quarters, geographic mix was negative but to a lesser degree as growth stepped-up in Europe and the U.S. The year-to-date net revenue drivers were very similar, with double-digit organic top-line growth built on positive volumes, smoke-free category mix of more than plus 2 points and strong pricing. Turning to operating income, we delivered impressive Q3 organic margin expansion of plus 90 basis points, and plus 110 basis points in dollar terms. Gross margins increased organically by 80 basis points, and by plus 70 basis points in dollar terms. This was again driven by our higher margin smoke-free business, pricing and ongoing productivity savings across the value chain. Moving now to SG&A. Despite a planned step-up in commercial activity, our organic cost evolution was essentially in line with top-line growth, with plus 40 basis points of margin expansion in adjusted dollar terms supported by cost efficiency actions. As previously communicated, we target an organic increase in SG&A below the rate of net revenue growth for the year, while still supporting our smoke-free expansion with continued commercial investment. We delivered an incremental $180 million in gross cost efficiencies in Q3 reaching almost $490 million year-to-date, with initiatives notably focused on manufacturing and back-office costs. While only the first year, we are progressing nicely towards our 2024-2026 target of $2 billion in gross savings. On a year-to-date basis, our adjusted operating income margin evolution was also very positive with plus 190 basis points organic expansion and plus 40 basis points in dollar terms. We are well set to meet our full-year objective of expansion on both bases. Turning now to our IQOS business, which is celebrating the ten-year anniversary of its first launches in Japan and Italy. IQOS is the world's leading smoke-free product, generating over $10 billion in annual net revenues. Notwithstanding the incredible growth and success of the brand over that time, there is a very substantial growth runway over the coming years as more of the world's one billion legal-age smokers switch to better alternatives. Indeed, robust growth continues this year. We spoke last quarter about our expectation for a strong H2 delivery, with continued user growth momentum supported by our commercial programs, including events to celebrate the 10-year milestone. As expected, Q3 momentum accelerated with plus 14.8% year-on-year growth in HTU adjusted IMS and a very substantial sequential step-up of 1.8 billion units versus Q2, which is especially impressive in a quarter that is typically negatively impacted by seasonality. This reflects a return to double-digit growth in Europe, a continued excellent trajectory in Japan, and a further acceleration from our global markets. We expect further strong growth in Q4. The success of IQOS is built on technology, commercial capabilities, brand-building and innovation on both devices and consumables. Following the successful launch of the IQOS ILUMA i device in Japan earlier this year, we are expanding the rollout to more markets, including Italy, Greece, Portugal, Romania and Switzerland. Focusing now on IQOS in Europe, I am pleased to report a Q3 reacceleration in adjusted IMS growth to plus 11.3% following a slower Q2 progression. This includes the resumption of growth in markets passing through the adjustment phase of the characterizing flavor ban. The majority of EU HTU volume is now covered by the ban, and we observe a return to robust growth in markets such as Greece, Romania, and Portugal. Following the stronger-than-expected initial impact in Q2, we are pleased to report positive volume momentum in Italy. This was supported by the launch of recent HTU variants, including our mainstream-priced offering DELIA, and tobacco-free LEVIA, jointly accounting for close to 7% of Italy's HTU offtake three months from launch. In addition, we see excellent momentum in markets such as Germany, Spain and the UK, and increasingly balanced growth across markets overall, regardless of IQOS penetration. Regional Q3 adjusted HTU share was up by +0.8 points year-on-year to 9.5%, and modestly lower sequentially due to the typical impact of seasonally higher combustible volumes in the summer. HTU adjusted IMS volumes reached 13.2 billion units on a four-quarter moving average, maintaining our high share of the category with robust sequential growth. Looking at our key city offtake shares in Europe, we see continued rapid progress in a large number of cities. An increasing number are posting growth of over 2.0 points year-on-year, which is the most meaningful comparison given seasonal factors. Particular callouts include Budapest, Athens, Bratislava, Bucharest, London and Amsterdam. Turning now to Japan, we delivered our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit progression with adjusted HTU IMS growth of plus 14%, reaching 10.9 billion units on a four-quarter moving average. Our commercial programs continue to drive meaningful results, with innovation on devices and consumables propelling a +3.2 point market share increase to 29.8% in Q3 and surpassing the landmark of 30% in September. This includes the impact of the IQOS ILUMA i device, which was launched in Q1 and delivers enhanced consumer satisfaction. As shown on the previous slide, IQOS HTU offtake shares in key cities such as Tokyo continue to advance rapidly. We have previously flagged that Tokyo offtake share for the overall heat-not-burn category reached 50% earlier this year. This is also now true in eight cities overall including Yokohama, Kawasaki, Sendai and Fukuoka, with several others rapidly approaching the same milestone. This is clearly a positive sign of the enduring growth potential in a market with already high penetration. Taking a more global view, we continue to see very good growth across a number of global markets, as highlighted by key city offtake shares. These include cities in Saudi Arabia, Mexico, and Egypt, where Cairo reached close to 10% share. Offtake share of more than 5% in Jakarta is indicative of the strong acceleration in Indonesia, as we continue our geographic and portfolio expansion, including a growing offer of clove TEREA HTU variants. Finally, I would like to call out duty-free, where the ongoing travel recovery combined with the strength of our multicategory portfolio delivered dynamic growth, with ZYN and VEEV increasingly offered alongside IQOS. Moving now to ZYN, the number one U.S. smoke-free brand continues to see very strong underlying momentum. As flagged previously, we are working to progressively increase our production volumes, and this was reflected in a sequential acceleration to 149 million cans shipped in Q3. As we continued working through these supply constraints, ZYN's category share stabilized and then resumed growth on a sequential basis through the quarter, despite a further $0.15 per can list price increase taken at the start of September. We continue to expect shipments to match consumer demand at some point during the fourth quarter. While gauging the level of underlying demand is not an exact science in the current circumstances, our promotional and commercial activity has naturally been lower as we prioritize meeting existing consumer needs over growing the legal-age user base from other nicotine categories. With ongoing efforts to increase our U.S. production capacity to around 900 million cans for the full year of 2025, and significant expansion beyond 2025 from our planned new facility in Colorado, we believe we are well positioned to capture ZYN's potential over the coming years. We remain committed to driving industry standards in under-21 prevention, with policies and initiatives designed to prevent youth access. Our robust U.S. marketing code prohibits social media influencers and we refuse requests for such partnerships. All our owned product websites use age verification technology and we partner with WeCard and TruAge to support age restriction checks for retail sales. Overall, we are encouraged by the results of our efforts, which I'll come back to. Combatting trade in illicit tobacco and nicotine products remains a top priority, and we dedicate a significant level of resources to support these efforts. We have strong governance and supply chain controls in place, and we take appropriate action where necessary, including limiting and/or terminating sales to certain customers in both the online and traditional trade, and we are continuously improving these control measures. We also closely monitor imports of products which may be illicit or infringing our patents and are committed to act on our own or in conjunction with the authorities to prevent these products being illegally commercialized. Our multicategory approach continues to gain momentum, as we leverage the strength of our leading brands whilst expanding the reach of our smoke-free portfolio. For nicotine pouches, we are focused on responsibly building the category with ZYN in international markets. Increasing category awareness and interest among legal-age nicotine users is driving positive traction in a growing number of geographies. We have increased ZYN's presence year-on-year to 30 markets, including the Philippines, Mexico, several European markets as well as within duty-free. Despite still-limited distribution in some markets, we see continued strong traction in Mexico, Pakistan, South Africa, the UK and duty-free. The category also continues to grow robustly in Scandinavia. E-vapor performance remained dynamic in Q3, and we reached profitability at product contribution level in September on the back of excellent volume momentum and cost of good sold improvements. Europe is at the forefront, as closed pods continue to take share from disposables and we lead the category with our flagship VEEV ONE closed-pod system in several markets, including Italy, Romania and the Czech Republic. We are seeing good repeat-purchase and regular usage within a competitive environment, as we continue to build distribution and brand awareness. Outside Europe, we are investing behind VEEV for future profitability in a number of focus markets. We are underway with the first stage of our IQOS 3 consumer pilots in the U.S., with the launch of our \u201cBe the first\u201d campaign in Austin, Texas. As explained previously, the focus is on adult consumer engagement, building awareness through category and brand education in legal-age smoker communities. We do not anticipate any commercial volumes in 2024. The learnings from these pilots in Austin and other cities will be used to fine-tune our approach in anticipation of the at-scale launch of IQOS ILUMA, where we continue to assume an FDA authorization in H2, 2025. Finally, a brief comment on our Wellness & Healthcare business. As we disclosed in September, we have entered into an agreement to sell Vectura Group and expect the transaction to close by the end of the year. Our ownership of Vectura was important to develop the required skill and scientific expertise to advance our inhaled therapeutics pipeline. Significant progress has been made on this front, however given that Vectura's scientific engagement and commercial CDMO relationships were being impacted by unwarranted opposition to PMI's ownership, we believe the overall future of Vectura will be better served under its new ownership. Together with the divestment, we announced the establishment of master service agreements to support the continued development of our inhaled therapeutics proprietary pipeline. Our Wellness & Healthcare strategy continues, and we look forward to updating you on future developments, including launches of consumer wellness products. Moving now to combustibles, where our portfolio delivered a very strong financial performance. Net revenues grew +8.6%, driven by Q3 pricing of +9.7%. This includes pricing taken during the quarter as we continue to focus on value maximization, and was led by markets such as Egypt, Turkey and Germany. As covered earlier this drove a very robust +8.7% increase in gross profit. With better-than-expected pricing of +8.8% on a year-to-date basis, we now forecast full-year pricing of +8 to +9%. Cigarette volumes were resilient, as global industry trends remain benign. As I touched on earlier, this can be largely attributed to markets where smoke-free products are not allowed or are early in their development, as well as the impact of significant industry efforts and geopolitical factors on global illicit trade in a number of markets. Our cigarette category share grew by +0.1 points in Q3 and year-to-date. Both Marlboro and our overall global brands achieved their highest quarterly share since the 2008 spin-off, with a corresponding positive impact on value share. As announced last week, there has been some long-awaited progress towards resolution of the decades-old cigarette-related litigation claims in Canada. Our Canadian affiliate RBH was deconsolidated in 2019 after entering the mediated CCAA process. The mediator's proposed plan would entail a settlement of around $23.5 billion for the industry, payable from cash and cash equivalents in Canada and future combustible profits in Canada. The reconsolidation of RBH's financial results after the plan is implemented would be subject to the final terms of the Proposed Plan and U.S. GAAP. We estimate reconsolidation would be incremental to PMI's cash and cash equivalent, cash flow and adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income, and adjusted EPS numbers. I direct you to last week's press release for further details. Moving now to sustainability. We are making continued strong progress towards our product transformation targets, including on access to smoke-free products. Our smoke-free products are now available in 92 markets, placing us on track for our aspiration of 100 by 2025. As a reminder, there remain a notable number of markets where smoke-free products are not yet available due to regulatory constraints, which in the case of heated tobacco make up close to one fifth of industry volumes excluding China, as covered at our Investor Day last year. We are also moving nicely towards our objective for low and middle-income countries to comprise over 50% of smoke-free products markets. Our efforts to increase access to smoke-free products are specific to legal-age nicotine users and tackling underage nicotine use is a critical area of focus. We are encouraged by the results of the U.S. 2024 National Youth Tobacco Survey, which reported youth usage of nicotine pouches remains very low at less than 2%, with no statistically significant change year-on-year despite the strong growth of the overall category. Such results can only be achieved through responsible stewardship of the category, and we are committed to continue driving standards in youth access prevention through a multi-stakeholder approach. Addressing our company's environmental impacts is another key pillar of our sustainability strategy. We are working towards carbon neutrality in our direct operations, including certification of all our manufacturing facilities as carbon neutral. Year-to-date, we certified four additional sites, bringing us to a total of 52%. We have concrete plans for the remainder of our footprint in order to achieve the 100% aspiration by 2025. Additionally, we are progressing with the Alliance for Water Stewardship standard, certifying one additional factory year-to-date to place us at 86% against our goal of 100% by 2025. Combining our ongoing initiatives to address our environmental impacts with robust and rigorous reporting processes, we believe we are well-prepared for upcoming reporting requirements, including the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. Okay. Turning now to our outlook for the full year. Following this stronger than expected year-to-date performance, we are raising our full-year volume, organic sales growth, organic OI growth and bottom-line currency-neutral and U.S. dollar forecasts. First to volumes, where we target record organic growth and increase our outlook to +2% to +3% total shipment progression. Within this, we continue to expect adjusted IMS HTU volume growth of around +13% and shipment volumes of around 140 billion. This forecast continues to assume an impact from the EU characterizing flavor ban of just over 2 billion units and no volumes in Taiwan, where we continue to await regulatory approval. For U.S. ZYN we forecast shipment volumes at the upper end of our prior guidance, in the range of 570 million cans to 580 million cans, reflecting the progress made on capacity expansion as well as continued strong demand. Our outlook also factors in a robust combustibles performance, driven by a resilient total category as previously outlined. Given the combination of stronger volumes with accelerated pricing and continued smoke-free mix, we are increasing our forecast organic net revenue growth to around +9.5%. This includes strong double-digit organic growth in smoke-free net revenue and should result in close to $15 billion in total for the year. With the impact of this improved top-line performance, coupled with IQOS and ZYN operating leverage and further cost efficiencies, we now also raise our forecast adjusted organic OI growth to +14% to +14.5% for the year. We continue to target adjusted gross margin expansion for both smoke-free products and combustibles, and adjusted OI margin expansion for total PMI, all in both organic and dollar terms. Accordingly, we are raising our forecast for currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth to +14% to +15%, which also factors in lower-than-anticipated net financing costs, including higher interest income. This translates into a range of $6.45 to $6.51, including an unfavorable currency impact of $0.40 for the year at prevailing rates. The $0.06 increase in expected currency headwind largely reflects the same factors as Q3. On a U.S. dollar basis, this forecast represents very robust growth of approximately +7% to +8%. As reflected in this forecast we expect another robust delivery in Q4, despite a more challenging top-line comparison on the mix of shipments between categories. We also target another quarter of adjusted gross and operating margin expansion, including a planned increase in commercial investments behind our smoke-free brands. Q4 net financing costs are likely to be sequentially higher, notably given the mark-to-market benefit in Q3 from the volatility in interest rate markets I mentioned earlier. Our expectations for strong operating cash flow of around $11 billion for the year are unchanged, and factoring in the most recent currency moves we now target a 0.3 times to 0.4times improvement in our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio in 2024. This places us well on track for our target ratio of around two times by the end of 2026, with buybacks to be considered, subject to Board approval, once we are within sight of this goal. In conclusion, we delivered another outstanding quarter reflecting the strong underlying momentum of our business coupled with our proactive steps to support superior growth in dollar term. We are delivering on all key metrics, with best-in-class volume and pricing, in addition to substantial margin expansion and earnings growth on both a reported and dollar basis. We are raising our growth outlook for an exceptional 2024, with growth rates comfortably above our 2024-2026 targets. While the industry dynamics affecting combustible volumes may be specific to 2024, the key drivers of our growth are both structural and sustainable. Legal-age smokers are looking for smoke-free alternatives and we are building strong and profitable premium brands with IQOS, ZYN and VEEV to lead the smoke-free category. As we continue our powerful smoke-free transformation we have significant further opportunities both in the U.S. and internationally. Importantly, we raised our dividend in September for the 17th successive year, in line with our progressive policy. We retain a strong and growing cash generation profile, which enables both reinvestment in long-term growth and the capacity for substantial shareholder returns. Thank you very much for your attention, and we are now very happy to answer your questions. Good morning, Bonnie. Sure, Bonnie, with pleasure, and you're giving me the opportunity to maybe be back on the fact that when you look at IQOS, I really urge you to watch at the in-market sales, the adjusted in-market sales, which is the best proxy we can have from consumer off-take. And on that indicator, the good news was the confirmation of the reacceleration that we were expecting and we have been flagging the fact that we're expecting accelerated momentum on IQOS in H2. And we are indeed seeing that in our Q3 adjusted in-market sales because we are almost at 15%. You were asking the question about East Asia. Actually, Japan delivered again around 14% of adjusted in-market sales. So the market for IQOS remain extremely dynamic despite the fact that we have, of course, already close to 30% market share, but we continue with strong double-digit, and that was a very good news. What happened in Q3 to explain the acceleration is, as I said, continued very strong dynamism in Japan. By the way, South Korea is also doing well. And we \u2013 I think we are showing the number in Seoul where we are nicely growing the market share. Then there was a reacceleration in Europe. And I know that we received a lot of questions, okay, how confident can you be in the fact that Europe is going to reaccelerate. We knew that we were going through this transition phase for the flavor ban. And we see the market progressively exiting the disruption of the ban with the reacceleration. Italy was, of course, during the third quarter, the country with the reacceleration and that was nice to see Italy clearly restarting on a very strong foot, the growth on IQOS. And we resumed double-digit growth on adjusted AMS in Europe in Q3. And then you have a number of other markets in the world. And I would say we see momentum here building up, which is very good news for the future. I could mention, of course, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, I think EU here as well. I mean, we see a number of markets where there is \u2013 and of course, Egypt, but Egypt has been now for more than a year with growth, where we see real momentum emerging behind IQOS which, of course, we're just at the beginning. So a lot of potential but that is very encouraging on the fact that we have nice growth relay outside Japan and EU for the future. So that's really what we've seen in Q3. Now you have the question on the shipment. Well, we've been flagging the fact that shipment would be \u2013 trajectory would be disconnected from the consumer off-take. We had some very strong growth in the first two quarters, which was notably driven by comparison year-on-year. There was, of course, a Red Sea disruption that generated some shipments in the first part of the year. And therefore, today, we have shipments that are a bit lower for the third quarter than the adjusted IMS. And we're just, if you want, here for the nine months going to a situation where gradually, we are equalizing adjusted IMS and the shipments. So that's what we are seeing. And in Q4, we're going to be with more equalization because we're going to be facing two elements. The first one, regarding the Red Sea disruption, we're going to have some reversal in Q4, so that will play negatively on the shipment. And we also are facing some high comps last year as we are building inventory to prepare the transition for the flavor ban in Europe. So that's a high comps in time of shipments last year. But at the end of the day, you should expect adjusted IMS and shipments through a certain period to evolve in parallel way. And as we said, we continue to expect, for Q4, a renewed momentum on a consumer off-take or what we call adjusted market sales, which is really what matters. That's what is important because that's what is talking about the health of IQOS. Sure. On ZYN, Bonnie, we said somewhere in Q4, we will have the supply to the market, meeting consumer demand, which to clarify again, doesn't mean that we will have fully been replenishing all level of inventory. Here at that point, we believe for what we can assess of the consumer demand that what we bring to the trade will correspond to what the consumer will take from the trade, will buy from the trade. But then there will certainly be \u2013 and I'm not able to tell you what is going to happen during this quarter. But I think we are still in this perspective then, but that's probably more for 2025, there will be a replenishment of the out-of-stock situation. And we will gradually \u2013 but that's going to happen only gradually probably through 2025, put back the level of inventory to what it should be normally and that certainly will take some months as we continue to increase the capacity. Remember, we said that for the full year 2025, we are targeting an overall capacity of around 900 million can. Of course, that is a capacity that we are going to build gradually. It won't be there at the beginning of the year. And I would say the replenishment and being back to a fully normal situation is going to happen only gradually through 2025. And of course, when we can be more specific about that, we will be more specific with the topic. So that's for supply. When it comes to regaining share, so what we've seen is that, in fact, when the availability of ZYN went down, we've seen the category slowing down because, obviously, it seems that a number of buyer of ZYN are not intending to buy another brand. And therefore, when they don't find their ZYN, they are maybe producing or consuming something else. But that probably has been slowing down a bit the category. We will see how we gradually recover. We've seen in the second part of the Q3, some improvement sequentially on our market share, which is good news. We believe that we have some positive outlook as we regain availability for the product, but it's difficult to be more specific than that at that stage. Thank you. Good morning, Gaurav. Thanks, Gaurav, for your question. So I don't want to enter now into commenting 2025. And of course, in due course, we'll share with you on the outlook for the year. I think what we are seeing in 2024 is well-identified. We talk about a number of markets where smoke-free products are not allowed. Sometimes you have increasing the prevalence, sometimes you have demographics that are playing positively for the consumption of cigarettes. I think India is a clear market when it comes to demographic, for instance. And it's difficult to say how long all that is going to play and what's going to be the continuation of this trajectory. I think we need to be a bit cautious on the outlook, but it's true that I cannot say that everything will finish on the 31st of December 2024. So we don't know what's going to be the trajectory in 2025. What is certainly good is to see that we are able to actually grow volume, grow share of segment and, at the same time, increase price in a very dynamic manner, which is a tribute to the strength of our brand, and it's true that the 9.7% in Q3 was a remarkable price increase. Don't take that for Q4 as a guidance, but that was very good in Q3. And that shows that in this category, where I think we've been clear on our objective, which is really to maximize the performance on combustible in order to accompany and help the fastest transition to smoke-free. I think this strategy on combustible is working and delivering. And remember, we also said that in 2025, we expect a number of positive evolution for combustible cigarettes when it comes to cost of goods, where we'll have a lower level of headwinds. So there will be continuation of price increase in the future without a doubt. Nevertheless, don't take the 8% to 9% as the guidance for the future. We always said that we were more mid-single digits on the medium term. And we should see less headwind on cost of goods, which is probably good for the combustible cigarette profitability. On excise tax, at that stage, there is nothing really material I can report, I would say, traditional discussion, but we're still a bit early. You know that many, many decisions are made in November, if not in December, so probably we'll know more at the end of the year. But so far, I would say nothing specific or unusual to flag. Yes, I can certainly confirm that 1 milliliter equates to 10 sticks, 10 cigarettes. That's the equivalent. And I would say that ballpark, I'm not going to confirm exactly, but you are not million miles away from the reality on volumes. On revenue, I won't comment. Thank you. Sure, Faham. With pleasure. So on greater success from vaping in convincing smoker, we don't see any of that. The experience is very different. It's quite obvious that versus heat-not-burn, heating a liquid, which has no tobacco is delivering a very, very different experiences. And I think all markets are pointing to the fact that there is clearly a much, much higher and much better conversion from smokers to heat-not-burn into vaping. And I think the success of IQOS is brightly illustrating that, I have to say, I'm not coming back on the performance on IQOS. I don't think we are really seeing an acceleration in the adoption of vaping. The vaping market, the vaping category is impacted today by many, many regulation evolution or potential evolution. We know that one of the problems of the vaping category is that you have a responsible player going for fancy flavor, unacceptable marketing behavior that can generate underage consumption that can be creating some disruption. We know that notably the disposable category has been generating some of that. But if you look at the \u2013 what we can say of the legal age nicotine user, I don't think that we can report any acceleration that would be meaningful from vaping. Regarding the nicotine part in the U.S., and your question on what we do, can you first allow me a general comment? I think that PMI is at the forefront, at the very forefront when it comes to fighting illicit trade. And that is true for the U.S., that is true everywhere in the world. We commit huge resources, I mean, investments in fighting illicit trade, working with authorities, regulators in many countries to do that. And for us, it's a very, very important battle, a very important fight. So, the U.S. make no exception. And yes, when we are aware of illicit, when we are aware of product infringing, potentially our patent, we are acting. I think that in my remarks, I signaled some of the things that we do. When we identified the sources that are potentially outside the U.S. we could go to even terminating sales to these sources. I said it. We are working with distributors. It can be informing, creating the awareness for illicit product writing to distributor. It can be sending cease and desist letter to distributor retail where we see an issue. And we do that on our own or working with the regulator, as I said, in the U.S. like everywhere in the world. So you can be sure that we take that extremely seriously. Thank you very much. Hi, great. Yes, taking these two questions with pleasure. So, on the slightly and very modestly narrowing the guidance for deleveraging, it's because of the euro strength at the end of September that was \u2013 because as you know, we have a significant part of the debt in euro and therefore, when the euro is going up versus the dollar, that can have a kind of one-off element because we always have this discrepancy between an EBIT that is calculated on an average rate for the year when the debt is going to be calculated on the spot on the 31 of December. So we'll see where we land. But the trajectory is clear. And you may have seen that at the end of the third quarter, we have generated cash flow of $8.2 billion, and that is simply $2.3 billion above the cash flow generation at the end of Q3 2023. So, we are highly generating cash, of course, on the back of a very strong momentum in the business, but that's good news. Yes, I mean, I am certainly not going to discard the possibility for us to be active on the refinancing market in the coming months. I am not going to elaborate now on that, and we have a number of options that are open to us. But you can be sure that we are already working on how to put in place the best refinancing again in the coming months for PMI. Thank you. Thank you, Gaurav. On the Canada litigation, so you have what we can say at that stage in our press release that we have issued last week. It's too preliminary. And as I said, I am not able to tell you whether it's going to be tax-deductible. Of course, as soon as we know we will let you know. But for the time being, I am not able to say. And as you may have seen in our release, where we shared what we can share at that stage, there are still a number of elements in this proposed solution put on the table by the mediators to be finalized. And of course, once we have the final terms, we will come back to you with this answer, of course, but also all the question on what's going to be the impact for PMI of a final settlement. Thank you. Look forward to speaking to you soon. Thank you. Have a great day."

It is now my pleasure to introduce Emmanuel Babeau, our Chief Financial Officer. Over to you, Emmanuel.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, James, and welcome everyone. Our business delivered another outstanding performance in the second quarter of 2024. Our categories were strong across the board to deliver a record H1 on organic top-line growth and on organic OI growth, excluding the pandemic recovery year of 2021. The strong underlying momentum of IQOS continued in Q2, with shipment and adjusted IMS volume growth above or in line with our expectations. This reflects another quarter of strong progress in Japan and robust fundamentals in Europe, despite the volatility of the characterizing flavor ban. With pricing, manufacturing efficiencies and scale benefits, the expanding profit contribution of IQOS is driving excellent growth for PMI. ZYN continued its impressive growth trajectory, with Q2 U.S. volumes growing by over +50% despite recent supply tensions and increased pricing. In addition to IQOS and U.S. ZYN, I am pleased to report building multicategory momentum. While still early days, VEEV has already become the closed pod leader in 5 European markets and is firmly on the path to profitability, while international nicotine pouch volumes grew over plus 60% in H1, matching U.S. growth rates. This progress of smoke-free product is reflected in a rapidly growing consumer base, with around 36.5 million estimated adult users as of June 30, and our products now available across 90 markets worldwide. Our combustible business also overdelivered, with a return to gross margin expansion ahead of plan in Q2 after two years of significant inflationary headwinds. This was driven by stable H1 volumes and category share despite robust pricing, in addition to cost efficiencies. This broad-based delivery translated into double-digit organic OI growth, with significant margin expansion. As we have outlined previously, delivering robust growth in dollar terms is a key priority and we are taking pro-active steps on pricing and cost efficiencies to mitigate currency headwinds. This is clearly evident in our H1 adjusted diluted EPS delivery of mid-single digit growth despite a currency headwind of over 12%, as essentially all of the expected full-year impact fell in the first half. Following this exceptional first half performance, we are increasing our 2024 full year forecasts on all organic dimensions, and for adjusted diluted EPS on both a currency neutral and US dollar basis. This reflects our strong H2 outlook with accelerating adjusted IMS growth for IQOS, sequentially higher ZYN volumes and a stepped-up rate of USD EPS growth, at prevailing exchange rates. Looking at our headline financials, strong total shipment volume growth of plus 2.8% drove Q2 organic net revenue growth of plus 9.6%, or plus 5.6% in dollar terms. Robust top-line growth, positive smoke-free margin mix and ongoing cost efficiencies enabled us to deliver adjusted diluted EPS of $1.59. This represents plus 10.6% growth excluding a larger-than-expected unfavorable currency variance of $0.18, which includes a small transactional impact from exchange rate volatility at quarter end. This better-than-expected ex-currency performance reflects the improving profitability of IQOS, ZYN and combustibles, which I will come back to. Looking at the first half overall, our volumes grew by plus 3.2%, and organic net revenues by plus 10.2%, our highest growth since the 2008 spin. Strong performance from both smoke-free and combustibles drove operating income growth of plus 17% with margin expansion of plus 230 basis points organically, and plus 7.1% growth in dollar terms. We expect continued robust OI growth on both a reported and an organic basis in the second half. H1 adjusted diluted EPS grew by an impressive plus 16.8% in constant currency and by plus 4.0% in dollar terms. The $0.38 unfavorable H1 currency variance includes $0.08 of non-recurring transactional impacts from Egypt and Russia. Focusing now on volume. Total shipment growth in both the quarter and H1 overall reflect smoke-free share gains in a resilient international industry, which grew by more than 1% in both periods, even excluding oral and e-vapor. Q2 HTU shipments of 35.5 billion units exceeded our prior outlook, notably driven by continued strong performance in Japan, robust underlying growth in Europe and promising growth in newer markets, such as Indonesia. In addition to underlying momentum, Q2 saw an incremental phasing impact of around 0.5 billion unit, primarily related to Red Sea disruption. Q2 HTU adjusted IMS volume grew by plus 10.2%, in line with our expectation. This includes the impact of the characterizing flavor ban in Europe, most notably in Italy this quarter. Total smoke-free adjusted in market sales volume grew plus 11.2% in Q2 and plus 13.1% in H1. This includes our oral smoke-free portfolio powered by ZYN with Q2 pouch unit volumes up by plus 20%. U.S. ZYN shipment grew by plus 50% to 135.1 million cans. This does not include the promising result of our e-vapor business where volume grew strongly to the equivalent of 0.7 billion units on a year-to-date basis. Cigarette shipments grew by plus 0.4% with notable positive contribution from Turkey and North Africa. This reflects a stable category share, excluding market mix, despite step-up pricing. With such a positive H1 volume performance, we are raising our full year forecast for total cigarette HTU and oral unit volumes to plus 1% to plus 2%, which would mark our fourth consecutive year of volume growth. The power of our multicategory smoke-free transformation and recovery in combustible are clearly illustrated on this slide, as both areas contributed strongly to double-digits organic OI growth of plus 12.5% for the Group in Q2. Smoke-free continued its excellent momentum with plus 18% organic growth in net revenue and plus 22% in gross profit, driving plus 220 basis points organic gross margin expansion. This reflects the strong performance of ZYN and the growth and scale effect of IQOS, including manufacturing productivities and an increasing all by smaller contribution from VEEV. Expanding smoke-free gross margin continued to widen the gap versus combustible gross margin, enhancing the very positive mix effect of our transformation. However, combustible gross margin expansion is also a key objective. After seven quarters of contraction, we are very pleased to report plus 50 basis point expansion and gross profit growth of plus 5.5% on an organic basis, providing a meaningful contribution to total PMI profitability. This reflects resilient volume despite very strong pricing in addition to ongoing efficiencies and reduced headwinds on our COGS, notwithstanding continued tobacco leaf inflation. We also expect convertible gross margin expansion in H2. Combined with a very strong first quarter, the year-to-date picture is even more compelling with double-digit organic net revenue, gross profit and OI growth. This is driven by the same dynamic as Q2 with an impressive plus 390 basis point gross margin expansion and plus 29% gross profit growth for our smoke-free business. Our H1 revenue performance again demonstrates the powerful drivers of our financial model with an unparalleled combination of positive volumes, robust pricing and the very favorable category mix of our smoke-free product. As mentioned, volume grew by plus 3.2%. Pricing contributed plus 6 points of growth, including plus 8.3% pricing on combustible and around plus 2% on smoke-free. Smoke-free category mix added plus 2.5 points to the top-line, reflecting the higher net revenue per unit of IQOS and ZYN. While it\u2019s still small, VEEV also contributed positively to the overall mix. I also note that oral smoke-free product added plus 2 points to organic net revenue progression, underlying the continued accretion from the Swedish Match acquisition. As in recent quarters, geographic mix was negative. This is primarily due to combustible where volumes increasingly skew to lower margin markets, where smoke-free alternatives are small or not available, with higher margin markets over-indexed to cannibalization. We expect this dynamic to be less impactful in 2024 than last year. Now let's focus on the mechanics behind our H1 margin delivery. Gross margin increased organically by 140 basis points and by 80 basis points in dollar terms. This was driven by our higher margin smoke-free business, pricing and ongoing productivity saving across the value chain. As expected, SG&A cost growth stepped-up in Q2, increasing 9.8% organically after a very modest increment in Q1 due to planned phasing of commercial spend. The resulting 5.8% organic increase in H1 was below the rate of top-line growth, driving plus 1 percentage point of margin expansion with our successful back-office cost program able to mitigate some of the investment step up. With a range of important commercial activities in Q3, we expect SG&A to remain elevated but continue to target an organic increase below the rate of net revenue growth for the year. I\u2019m pleased to report we delivered over $300 million in H1 growth cost efficiencies across both COGS and SG&A, as we pro-actively drive bottom-line growth. We expect an acceleration in H2 savings, notably from manufacturing, as we progress towards our $2 billion target for '24, '26 period. The combination of these factors drove a plus 230 basis point expansion in our organic operating income margin. Despite a significant H1-skewed currency headwind, adjusted OI margin were stable on a dollar basis. Moving to our smoke-free business. We estimate there were 36.5 million adult users of PMI smoke-free product as of June 30th, reflecting an addition of 3.2 million during H1. This includes an estimated 30.8 million IQOS users, 5.2 million oral users and 0.8 million VEEV users. The increase in both total and IQOS users was broad-based with notable progress in Japan, Europe and newer growth markets, such as Indonesia, in addition to ZYN\u2019s strong traction with legal-age nicotine user in the U.S. Our smoke-free products are now present in 90 markets following recent launches of IQOS, ZYN and VEEV. Focusing now on IQOS in Europe, where fundamental dynamics are developing very well including the user growth I just mentioned. First, we see robust recoveries in markets, where the characterizing flavor ban has passed the initial adjustment phase. Second, there is continued excellent growth in markets where IQOS is already well-established such as Portugal, Hungary and Greece. Last, new growth leader markets are emerging with accelerating momentum in Germany, Spain, Bulgaria and Romania in addition to recovery in Poland, following the launch of DELIA. Our Q2 HTU share increased by 0.8 points year-on-year despite the impact of the flavor ban, due to the usual seasonal factors and the resilient combustible market, Q2 share was sequentially below Q1. HTU adjusted IMS volume demonstrated robust growth, growing by 0.8 billion units sequentially to reach 12.9 billion on a four quarter moving average. As expected, adjusted in market sales growth of plus 6.8% was lower than in Q1 due to higher comparison and the initial impact of the characterizing flavor ban, notably in Italy. Growth excluding Italy was close to 10%. The impact of the ban is progressing in line with our prior estimate in the majority of markets, though the implementation in Italy during Q2 was slightly more pronounced than anticipated. This was primarily driven by earlier sell-through of affected SKUs and concurrent pricing. It is important to note, this is a transitory dynamic and I'm pleased to report a recovery in markets such as Greece, Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Romania where the ban was implemented previously following an initial period of consumer adjustment. Indeed, despite an uncertain outlook in Ukraine, we anticipate an acceleration in Europe adjusted IMS growth in the second half. This is supported by the planned step-up in commercial activity behind IQOS, including the introduction of DELIA and LEVIA HTUs to an increasing number of markets. Another illustration of our continued progress in Europe is in our key city offtake share. Strong gains in city with already high IQOS adoption such as Budapest, Bucharest, Bratislava, Lisbon and Sofia; and historically slower growth markets such as Madrid, London and Amsterdam, highlight the enduring growth potential in the region. Japan demonstrated impressive IQOS growth in the quarter, with adjusted HTU IMS growth of plus 12.5%, representing the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit progression. Adjusted IMS volumes continued to grow sequentially, reaching 10.5 billion units on a four-quarter moving average. Total tobacco share for our HTU brand increased by 3.1 points year-on-year to 29.4% with national offtake share exceeding the impressive milestone of 30% in June. We also maintained offtake share of over 35% in Tokyo despite seasonal factors, where the overall category continued to track at over 50% of total offtake and grow sequentially, demonstrating the continued potential in this important market. Our continuous innovation is a key driver of this growth, with Q2 seeing a strong step-up in user acquisition following the launch of ILUMA i, and further innovative TEREA variants such as capsule consumables. Taking a more global view, we continue to see very promising IQOS growth across a broad range of geographies, including low and middle income market as highlighted by key city offtake shares. Accelerating growth in Indonesia, the world's largest cigarette market by volume excluding China, leads the way with increasing geographic reach and Clove HTU innovation. Markets across North Africa and the Middle East are also a growing weight and source of growth. We show Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia here in addition to Egypt where performance in Cairo remains robust despite recent pricing and a recovery in the combustible market. I am also pleased to report very good progress in the UAE and Jordan. Following the recent launch of ILUMA, growth in Mexico City is very promising and the East Asian market of South Korea and Malaysia continue to perform well. Also worth highlighting is the successful contribution of Duty Free, where we are increasingly leveraging our multi-category portfolio to expand share in a growing market as travel recovers in Asia. Our fundamental HTU growth outlook for the year has not changed. H1 adjusted IMS growth of plus 11.4% reflects the strong dynamic I described across Japan, Europe, and global markets, partly offset by the transitory impact of the EU flavor ban. Indeed, growth excluding Europe accelerated compared to the last year and we expect this to continue. However, we see an incremental headwind of around 2 billion units to our full year adjusted IMS forecasts, the majority of which is driven by the ongoing delay in approval for commercialization in Taiwan, which was previously expected around the midpoint of the year. We also factor in an impact of a few hundred million units for a slower recovery from the characterizing flavor ban in Europe, principally in Italy. I would note that our revised full year forecast for adjusted IMS growth of around 13% represents the same absolute volume increase as 2023 despite the EU headwind. We accordingly forecast full year HTU shipment volume of around 140 billion units with shipment as usual expected to be a few billion units higher than adjusted IMS given continued offtake and user growth. Importantly, we expect a very strong H2 delivery in adjusted IMS on both sequential and year-on-year basis to between plus 14% and plus 15% growth. This is supported by a notable step-up in commercial activity, continued momentum in Japan and increasingly dynamic global markets. These include the markets I just mentioned and the ongoing acceleration in Duty Free. For Europe, the broadening of growth acceleration in Germany, Spain, the UK, & Romania adds to the ongoing momentum in geographies such as Portugal and Greece. H2 should also see several markets start to rebound from initial flavor ban impact, including a gradual recovery in Italy. Turning now to ZYN, where very good U.S. progress continued in Q2 with close to plus 70% growth in 12-months rolling shipments. As we shared earlier in the year, strong demand dynamics have created short-term supply chain constraints, which has impacted volume growth. As shown on this slide, this has resulted in a temporary slowdown of the category. ZYN's premium positioning and superior brand equity remained strong, with ZYN maintaining very robust category volume and value share, despite these availability challenges and the recent price increase. We also remain highly-focused on marketing ZYN responsibly to prevent unintended use. We are making good progress on expanding production and continue to expect a gradual improvement through Q3, with sequentially higher volume and for production volumes to meet expected consumer demand during the course of Q4. We expect the ongoing expansion of the existing facility in Kentucky to provide around 900 million cans of capacity for 2025. We also recently announced a planned investment in a new plant in Colorado, which is due to begin preliminary operation by the end of next year. Together, these plans support our U.S. growth ambitions for the coming years. For 2024, we are now forecasting a U.S. shipment range of 560 million to 580 million cans, to reflect strongly increasing demand from adult nicotine user and the progress made on increasing our production capacity. I will now take a moment to update you on the international expansion of our smoke-free business. Our multicategory approach is gaining momentum, as we unlock new horizon of growth with increasing commercialization of IQOS, ZYN and VEEV across markets. Our focused strategy for VEEV is showing very good early results. In Europe, closed pods are accelerating within the dynamic e-vapor category. We are seeing strong traction of our VEEV ONE product, achieving a number one closed pod position in five markets within the first year of launch including Italy, the Czech Republic and Romania. We continue to observe good repeat purchase and conversion rate, which is often a challenge for this category. We continue to expect good production and conversion rate which is often challenge for this category. We expect continued volume momentum in H2, supported by ongoing geographic expansion and to reach profitability in Q3. For ZYN, there is a large opportunity outside of the U.S., which we are working to capture. Our international nicotine pot volume, including the Nordics, grew by over plus 60% in H1, matching U.S. ZYN growth. We see promising results in a number of markets, including Mexico, South Africa, Pakistan and the important UK market where we have seen strong traction with only limited distribution so far. Our expansion of the IQOS portfolio remains active as we innovate to broaden and enhance our offer for both existing user and switching other smokers. Further market launches are planned in H2 including DELIA and LEVIA HTUs and the new ILUMA i device range which is currently only available in Japan. We also continue with our preparation for IQOS ILUMA in the U. S. And we are underway with consumer engagement for our first city pilot in Austin, Texas with the IQOS 3 system, which we expect to start in Q4. As mentioned previously, the commercialization will be initially limited in scope and focused on direct activation of select legal edge smokers in a few cities, allowing us to experiment with different elements of the commercial model. The main purpose is to fine tune our approach and readiness in anticipation of the at scale launch of ILUMA. We continue to assume an authorization from the FDA in the second half of 2025. Focusing now on combustibles. Our portfolio delivered robust organic net revenue growth and a very positive profit contribution as I covered earlier. This reflects resilient volume despite very strong Q2 pricing of plus 8.7% including our proactive action to maximize growth. It is worth noting the large majority of our pricing is derived from regular pricing action unrelated to significant currency devaluation. Factoring the strong H1 and favorable outlook, we now forecast an increased fully combustible price variance of plus 7% to plus 8%. Our cigarette category share was stable in H1 and down 0.2 in Q2, or stable excluding market mix impact. Lower share in Egypt and Indonesia was offset by positive contribution from Turkey, India and the Europe region, again despite strong pricing. Our global brand grew category share in the quarter with Marlboro gaining plus 0.3 points to 10.1%. On a global basis, our leadership in combustible is a critical enabler to maximize switching to smoke-free product, and we target a stable category share over time. As mentioned previously, we evaluate our strategy on a market-by-market basis and have the flexibility to adapt our approach where smoke-free products have already reached critical mass. Taking a more holistic view on the business. Our transformation and smoke-free journey are backed by a strategy that seeks to embed sustainability in all that we do. We are making strong progress towards our product transformation targets. Our smoke-free products are now available in 90 markets, placing us on-track for our aspiration of 100 by 2025. We are also moving nicely towards our objective for low and middle income countries to comprise over 50% of smoke-free product market. The rapid growth of our estimated SFP user base, which now stands at around 36.5 million adult users, as previously described, is further testament to this progress. With regard to our operation, decarbonization is an important focus area and we are very pleased to have been awarded the top spot on the Forbes\u2019 2024 Net Zero Leaders list, which highlights the 100 U.S. public companies best positioned to reduce their greenhouse gas emission. It also follows the announcement earlier this year of CDP awarding us a triple-A rating for our disclosure and efforts on climate change, forest and water security. This recognition reflects our continued focus on our sustainability performance and robust reporting, as we continue to work towards a smoke-free future. This bring me to our outlook for 2024. Following an excellent H1 performance and strong business momentum, as we start the second half, we are raising our full year currency neutral and U.S. dollar growth forecast. This is supported by accelerated total volume growth and pricing and reflects the very strong outlook for ZYN, despite short-term supply constraint and the increasing profitability of IQOS due to operating leverage, manufacturing efficiencies and pricing. We continue to target close to $15 billion in smoke-free net revenue for the year. Taking these factors into account and robust combustible performance, we are increasing our organic net revenue growth forecast to a range of plus 7.5% to plus 9%. In addition to strong top-line growth, the positive smoke-free mix effect, combustible recovery and further cost efficiency enable healthy margin expansion. We are accordingly raising our organic operating income growth forecast to plus 11% to plus 13% for the year. We continue to target adjusted gross margin expansion for both smoke-free product and combustible, and adjusted OI margin expansion for total PMI, all in both organic and dollar terms. Consequently, and also factoring a lower forecast net financing cost, we are raising our forecast for currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth to plus 11% to plus 13%. This translates into a range of $6.33 to $6.45 including an unfavorable currency impact of $0.34 for the year at prevailing rates. The increased currency headwind versus prior guidance is primarily due to the Q2 impact already described. As shown by the increase in our forecast U.S. EPS growth to plus 5% to plus 7%, the underlying strength of our business and proactive mitigating actions have allowed us to more-than-compensate for this, and we expect to deliver on our objective of strong growth in dollar terms. Focusing on the second half in more detail. We expect another strong performance driven by excellent IQOS adjusted IMS growth, the progressive improvement in ZYN volume and continued positive impact from our actions to drive bottom-line growth. For Q3, we forecast a record high quarterly adjusted diluted EPS of $1.77 to $1.82 despite a significant step-up in commercial spending and an unfavorable currency impact of $0.02 at prevailing rates. This is in contrast to a forecast currency tailwind of $0.04 for H2 overall, which enables us to target accelerated U. S. dollar adjusted diluted EPS growth. We include a table of estimated currency impact by quarter in the appendix. This Q3 forecast notably reflects another quarter of dynamic growth with HTU shipment of 34 billion to 35 billion units and an acceleration in HTU adjusted IMS growth. Given expectation for a strong full year profit delivery, we are forecasting operating cash flow of around $11 billion which is at the upper end of our previous forecast range at prevailing exchange rate and subject to year-end working capital requirement. We expect this improvement to more than offset an increase in capital expenditure to around $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion as we further accelerate ZYN capacity expansion. Last, we continue to target 0.3x to 0.5x improvement in our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio in 2024, driven by profit growth and strong cash flow generation. As of June 30, we have already improved a ratio of 3x on a 12-month trailing basis as compared to 3.2x at the end of 2023. This represents good progress towards our target of around 2x by the end of 2026. We intend to reconsider share repurchase subject to board approval once we are within sight of this goal. I will now conclude today's presentation with some closing remarks. The powerful combination of strong underlying business momentum and our own proactive steps enable us to generate best-in-class growth across key metrics. Our strategy is delivering on volumes, pricing, cash flow and dollar earnings despite ongoing currency headwinds. The success of our smoke free transformation is reflected in our remarkable first half performance with excellent underlying IQOS and ZYN growth, very robust pricing, positive category mix and stepped-up cost efficiencies. This puts us firmly on track for an exceptional 2024 with accelerated top line growth and margin expansion. Our momentum is broadening across the business with exciting multi-category growth opportunity to further support the delivery of our 2024-2026 growth targets. We remain highly focused on delivering performance in dollar. And as shown in H1, we are taking measures to mitigate currency headwinds. Finally, we are steadfastly committed to returning cash to our shareholders. Our growth outlook and strong cash flow generation underpins our capital allocation priorities to reinvest behind our rapidly transforming business alongside our progressive dividend policy. Thank you, and we are now very happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Gaurav Jain of Barclays.\nGaurav Jain: So 2 questions from me. One is just on the cigarette pricing algorithm that you have. So if I look at your market share gains, clearly quite impressive, even excluding modern oral. And if I add that, then you are gaining almost 80 basis points share right now per annum. So isn't that level of market share gain excessive and suggest that you are not monetizing your cigarette business as much as we should be? And that would mean that increased the pricing growth in cigarettes from 7% to 8% to, let's say, to 10%? And then I have a follow-up.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Gaurav, for the question. Look, let's be clear. We can always challenge us on whether we could do even better in terms of price increase. The fact is that we are doing better than what we thought initially. We have this very strong performance, 8.7% price increase for combustible for H1. I think we all know that the inflationary environment is no longer what it was last year. So obviously, this is a very strong performance. Please bear in mind, I said it in my preliminary remarks, but around 3/4 of that is not coming from inflation in -- sorry, from a price increase in a country with very high inflation. And this 8.7% in Q2 is largely driven by the markets where we are really driving price on a kind of opportunistic basis, building on the strength of our portfolio and making sure that we are ever optimizing the potential for price increase. So you can be absolutely sure that this is a very granular work, market by market each time as we signal, we take into account what is our position on smoke-free product on this market, what is the impact of increasing price. And I think we can demonstrate that we have a very successful approach on this price increase. So I would tend to believe that we are optimizing this price increase potential in the current environment.\nGaurav Jain: You mentioned that ZYN capacity will increase to 900 million cans next year. So does it mean that by Q4 of this year, it will be 225 million cans per quarter?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Look, I'm confirming that we have the objective to be around 900 million can of production capacity for next year, that's for the full year 2025. We are gradually improving our capacity, and there is a number of steps that we are taking. I'm not going to elaborate on them, but there are several levers that we are pulling to increase this capacity. So I would say every quarter versus the previous one, we are improving the capacity. I'm not going to give a prediction on where we're going to be at the end of the year. We believe, given what we see from the potential consumer demand today, that in terms of what we produce at a certain point in Q4 versus what the consumer offtake could be without restriction, we're going to be good. And then we'll see exactly how we finish in terms of capacity at the end of the year. But I think what is more relevant and, frankly, more important is you have the picture of this 560 million to 580 million can. That is our goal for 2024. You know that we have this capacity for 900 million cans for next year. Let's be clear, it's not a guidance on the volume for next year. We're just here giving the capacity on which we are working. And I think with that, you have what is important.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will be coming from Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: I had a question on your guidance. You raised your top and bottom line growth expectations, but you lowered your HTU shipment volume outlook slightly. And you attributed this to slightly greater-than-expected impact from the EU flavor ban. And you did touch on this, but maybe hoping for a little more color on that and any other impact on HTU volume that you're expecting in the back half? Are you expecting IQOS growth to remain robust in Japan in the second half, for instance? And then finally, you mentioned your HTU guide assumes no volumes in Taiwan. So maybe an update there in terms of timing?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Sure, Bonnie. Thank you for maybe giving me the opportunity to further clarify the dynamic and the good dynamics that we are seeing behind IQOS. So we are indeed revising, first of all, our objective of adjusted in-market sales by around 2 billion. I've been clarifying that the majority of that is coming from Taiwan, okay? So in fact, it's really the fact that we were expecting Taiwan to start more than 6 months this year. And it's -- at the end of the day, today, we are making here the assumption that at the end of the day, it's going to be zero volume in Taiwan. We thought it was a reasonable assumption. Remember the law allowing for heated tobacco product was passed now 15 months ago. So we thought that during this period of time, there was this capacity to get the approval from the regulator. And there is an administrative process, asking question, you have Q&A. It's just taking much more time than what we thought. But first and foremost, the reason for this 2 billion revision on adjusted IMS is Taiwan. Then in addition to that, we have this a few hundred million that is coming from Europe. So that's really all you should understand, the 2 billion. And because of Taiwan, we are indeed saying when we were expecting to be above 140 billion in terms of shipments. We are now expecting to be around 140 billion. Again, that's the way you should understand the revision on the guidance. But let me take 2 minutes to explain the dynamic because I want to make sure that things are very clear. What we've been seeing in H1 is, in fact, an acceleration of the IQOS business outside Europe. So if you look at the adjusted in-market sales outside Europe, and we talk about 60% of the business, the adjusted IMS were growing around 14% versus around 13% last year. So we've been growing faster in percentage. So you can imagine in terms of volume, of course, that means a significant acceleration. And indeed, what is beyond this very nice dynamism is Japan. You have other developed markets such as South Korea, but we've been seeing a number of new contributor to this growth. We mentioned Indonesia. We mentioned a number of markets in Middle East. Mexico is also accelerating, and we enjoy also a nice performance in duty-free. So that's really what we are seeing outside Europe. Then Europe, absolutely as expected. I mean, we are going through what is a significant transition. We are moving away from flavor. It's still growing. Outside Italy, we have adjusted in-market sales growing close to double-digits. So very strong in dynamism despite the fact that many of the country are going through this transition. And as we flagged, it is true that it's really great to see, at the same time, our champion market, like we mentioned in Portugal, Hungary that continue to do very well. We have new markets that are really confirming their status of growth driver for the future. We mentioned Germany, Spain, Romania, Bulgaria. So it's important to have this new growth provider, if you want. And then a number of markets exiting, I would say, as expected, the turmoil or the disruption, I would say, of a few weeks that is coming with -- with the implementation of the flavor ban. And here, we can mention Greece, we can mention Romania, we can mention Bulgaria, we can mention Czech Republic. So a number of markets where things are happening absolutely as expected. And then you have Italy, where we've been, in fact, not evaluating well the level of flavored products available with distributor and with retail, and there was less than what we thought. And therefore, the consumer offtake has been impacted quicker than what we were anticipating by the absence of a flavor product after the implementation of the flavor ban, and that has had some impact on the growth. And at the same time, no doubt that the 2 accumulating have had some impact. We've been increasing price by $0.30 on our consumables. And that has not been followed only very marginally by the competition with some impact on our market share as it happens when we increase price in a meaningful manner, widening the gap with competition and the competition not following. So that is really the picture. And now when we are looking at the second half, so we expect outside Europe situation to continue to do well. I'm not going to name again all these very great country where we are performing extremely well. We have the launch of LEVIA and DELIA in a number of countries. And we expect Europe to accelerate as we are transitioning out of this phase of adjustment to the flavor ban. And Italy will be part of the market where we expect improvement. But I would say, globally, we expect more acceleration on all the markets that have been going through the flavor ban. So I think this is really the complete picture, Bonnie. I hope it is helpful in answering your question.\nBonnie Herzog: That was definitely very helpful. I appreciate you going through all of that. And then if I may, I just wanted to ask a question on ILUMA i in Japan. I guess I was hoping to get a little more color on this device, which I believe is only available in Japan right now. And curious to hear how big of a lift it's been or essentially how incremental and really what you're seeing or hearing from consumers in terms of acceptance of the new device, impact on your growth, margins, et cetera? And then finally, your plans for further rollout of this device.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Sure, Bonnie. So you're right. ILUMA i, so the latest generation of IQOS ILUMA. So it does not change the fundamental technology, but the -- the device is offering a number of additional functionalities, is, for the time being, only present in Japan. There was the launch in a few other countries that is planned for H2. And it's always difficult to say what this new product is triggering, but we've been seeing clearly a new acquisition of IQOS user. We've been seeing consumer sentiment going up with some very good reaction to this product. So I would say we continue to have more ammunition to convert smokers to IQOS, to improve the experience, to improve customer satisfaction that is triggering of course, more loyalty that can have some impact on the average daily consumption, so a number of positive effects. That's what we have seen in Japan. Difficult for me to tell you exactly by how much this has been further accelerating the growth in Japan, but now that was a positive for the market.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will be coming from Matt Smith of Stifel.\nMatt Smith: Could you provide a little more detail on the growth in oral pouches in international markets? You highlighted some early success in several markets. Are you continuing to expand distribution there? Are there any capacity constraints for those international markets outside of the U.S.?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Sure. So as a coincidence, I suppose that it is true that in H1, the growth in nicotine pouch outside the U.S. was very similar to the 1 in the U.S., what chart. It's -- we talk about 10% only of the volume in the U.S. That is included. It's not totally nothing because that is including the Nordics. And what we are clearly seeing is that there is from the nicotine user, some interest and attraction in many countries. And I tend to really put 3 buckets of possible growth for this market. You have, of course, first, the Nordic country that have the knowledge, the understanding the culture of this product and where the nicotine pouch category is dynamic. And here, we want to take our fair share of the growth. Then you have Europe, where the category is not relevant in all markets, but we can already flag a number of countries such as Austria, the U.K., Switzerland, where we believe that there is potential, and we see the growth. And then you have, I would say, global market, international market. We can name Pakistan, we can name South Africa. We could talk about Indonesia and the Philippines, where we see potential for these nicotine pouches. You may have some culture already of overall product. And we see some development of the product. I could add Mexico to the list, by the way, where we are starting nicely the development of ZYN. So we see that this product maybe because of the U.S. influence, I think in the case of some country like the U.K., it's clear. That's a category that could grow in awareness, I would say, interestingly and rapidly, and we want absolutely to make sure that we're going to capture our fair share of this opportunity.\nMatt Smith: And just a quick follow-up. Is there any capacity limitation on that international business? Or is that capacity not constrained like what you're seeing in the U.S.?\nEmmanuel Babeau: No, there is no capacity issue that I have to report at that stage.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will be coming from Faham Baig of UBS.\nFaham Baig: Hi Emmanuel, thanks for the question. I've got 2 as well. One, the vapor category and 1 on ZYN. I know you're looking to expand with your VEEV product, but how do you see the development of the vapor category, particularly outside of the U.S.? What profile of users is the category attracting? For example, in Europe, I'm just trying to understand whether consumers that use vapor see it as an alternative to heated tobacco? Or are the 2 categories attracting a different profile of consumers, particularly post the flavor ban in Europe?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Sure. And you want to ask a question on ZYN now? Or you want to come back on ZYN after?\nFaham Baig: Why don't I come back after --\nEmmanuel Babeau: Okay. So on the vaping category, I think what we are seeing is that with what we've always been saying, the vaping category is a legitimate category to be an alternative to people who would otherwise smoke. And therefore, that is a category that is growing, not necessarily faster than burnt, not faster than nicotine pouch for sure. But of course, the basis for nicotine pouch is smaller. And we know that the vaping category is more appealing for people legal age and above that want to start consuming nicotine and it's much more difficult to convert smokers. And that's clearly what IQOS and the heat-not-burn category is doing much better. So yes, the vaping can be appealing for some legal age and above nicotine user. More difficult to convert smokers, very clearly. We haven't seen any meaningful report of people moving to vaping and a change of kind of dynamic in the category following the implementation of the flavor ban in Europe. Of course, we are monitoring that. But as I said, there is nothing that we can obviously report on that trend, which probably could confirm that we talk about people that are probably with different profile, but that's something that we will have to keep monitoring, of course. So we've always been saying that the concern with the vaping category is that if the products are not properly developed and marketed. If there is an unreasonable appeal to flavor, what that can trigger unintended usage, and that is a problem for the category. And we are very happy with our growth because we do that in a very responsible manner, both in terms of development of our product, development of our marketing activity. And we are developing this responsible approach, very much based on our commercial strength and a great product. I think VEEV ONE is a great product, and strong partnership with the trade that is giving this very good start as we mentioned, the number 1 position in five countries for close pods. That's really what I can share with you at that stage.\nFaham Baig: Yes, that's helpful. And then secondly, on ZYN in the U.S. Now according to the scanner data, some of which we received today as well, since momentum from a volume perspective is sequentially falling, albeit very, very low single-digits, would you have an estimate of if you did not have the capacity constraint, what volumes could potentially look like? And in the back half, when you are expecting an acceleration in volumes, is that implying that you begin to gain market share? Or is that largely driven by further acceleration in the overall category?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Look, on ZYN, I think we mentioned the fact that we are clearly with some restrictions. So I'm not sure that what you read in the Nielsen, which corresponds to the availability is going a view on the trend and the consumer demand, we are gradually improving, and we expect to see that in the coming months, the availability. Today, we clarify that we are working with a target of around 900 million can capacity for next year. So we are creating very nice headroom for growth for the coming quarters. And we think it's really important. I'm not going to be able to tell you because, frankly, it's impossible to say what would have been the growth rate without the limitation. Please bear in mind that there were some competitors move in term of pricing last year that triggered an acceleration in our market share, and that the effect is now behind us. So it is also having some impact on the year-on-year comparison. So that's what we can say on ZYN.\nFaham Baig: If I could quickly squeeze in 1 more. Is there any update on the review of the ZYN sales post the recent subpoena in the District of Columbia that is ongoing and forced you to close your zyn.com sales and when that might recover?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes, I know, there is nothing new. We keep working and fully cooperating, of course, with the Attorney General. And at that stage, it's impossible to say how long the work will take or what will be the conclusion. And there is nothing new today.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question will be coming from Owen Bennett of Jefferies.\nOwen Bennett: I hope you are well. I just had a couple of questions on the U.S. pouch dynamics. So first -- and I would assume this is due to certain retailers trying to fill the supply gap. I have been seeing some Scandinavian ZYN available in certain stores. So I was wondering how you can get on top of this to make sure that's not happening. And then second, I'm also now seeing over more than oral brands appearing, I assume do not have a PMTA submitted. So how do you see the risk we could see a similar scenario developing in pouches in the U.S. and to what we're seeing in vape with the legal products?\nEmmanuel Babeau: So you're alluding to product that would come from non-U.S. market, correct? That's what...\nOwen Bennett: In retail, the distributors are buying them online from Scandinavia to try and fill the supply gap. Just wondering how you can get on top of that to make sure that's not happening?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Look, I don't have any information about that. So I cannot make any comment or report. I think we are doing everywhere we can, our utmost to ensure that the flows are appropriate and not going where they should not be going. And we are working very hard with this objective. And I don't have any data and I cannot react on that. But our position is very clear. We are very strict on doing everything we can to make sure that this parallel flows are not happening. On your question on -- if I understand you well, Owen, could -- do we see the same kind of phenomenon on nicotine pouch than the 1 we are seeing on vaping, which is illicit parallel flow that would be entering the U.S. market?\nOwen Bennett: Yes. I'm starting to see brands that I'm assuming do not have the MTS. Just wondering how you see the risk around that?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Today, from what we can monitor in the market, we are not having the feeling that there is anything material at that stage. But of course, we are monitoring that very carefully. If it was to become material, I think what we are clearly seeing today is that the authorities take that seriously, and they are starting to have much more action and be much more alert on the topic. So I would expect them to have the same behavior when it comes to nicotine pouches. So to summarize, I don't think we're seeing anything meaningful today to be certainly watched. And if it was to become the case, we would expect the authority to have the same, I would say, proactive behavior that they -- I think they are starting to implement on vaping.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Callum Elliott of Bernstein.\nCallum Elliott: Actually a follow-up, quite a similar question to what you just had for a moment, but I want to push you a bit further because we also, like Owen, see pretty widespread evidence now that European moist versions of ZYN that do not have premarket approval as far as I'm aware and weren't in the market as of August 2016 are available for sale on a widespread basis across New York City. But also, the online performance suggests that this has become a pretty widespread issue across the U.S. as a whole. So I guess 2 questions. Can you just confirm for us that those products weren't in the market of August 2016 and that they are being sold in breach of FDA regulations? And then, I guess, secondly, building upon what Owen asked, presuming that you're not selling a list of product directly to U.S. retailers yourselves -- and what can you do? And what are you doing to stop European e-commerce retailers selling this product? Because it strikes me that this presents a pretty meaningful potential risk to your U.S. ZYN business if this illicit product continues entering the U.S. market in this way.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Callum. Look, again, I don't have any data on what you're saying. So it's very difficult for me to report. I think we know whether the product that benefit from the situation and the positioning in 2016 in the market and that, therefore, are legally being commercialized. As you can imagine, I'm going to repeat only what I said. We are doing everything we can to control the flows. I don't have information today saying that you have these flows of product. If we knew, we would certainly tackle that, and we would try to understand where it's coming from. And what I can certainly repeat is that our objective is to do our utmost, everything we can to be compliant with the regulation. And there is nothing else I can say, really.\nCallum Elliott: Okay. And maybe just a follow-up. I guess, as you think about bringing supply back online in the U.S., also bringing new supply online to meet demand, what gives you this confidence that we're going to see the sort of upward lift in ZYN guidance today? Implies a very significant sort of back half hockey stick in terms of sort of positive inflection in the growth rate. Which, to Faham's earlier question, we see sequential declines in growth now quarter-to-date. So what gives you the confidence that the consumers are switching to on consumers that are switching to rogue, some of the consumer reviews of some of these competitive products are sometimes better than this. So what gives you the confidence that now that consumer awareness for these other brands has grown as a result of your supply chain issues that you're going to immediately win those consumers back when the supply comes online again?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Look, Callum, this is obviously coming from a mix of consumer demand perception that we have. And we believe that if we can produce them, there is a space to get to 580 million can shipments. That's the first element. And that's what our senses are telling us about, what consumer would be happy to buy if it was available. And at the same time, of course, our measures to increase production capacity, where, as I said, I'm not going to elaborate on the various levers, but we're pulling a number of levers to progressively increase the capacity for ZYN production in the U.S. So that's really the combination of the 2.\nOperator: And our last question will be coming from Priya Ohri-Gupta of Barclays.\nPriya Ohri-Gupta: Emmanuel, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on the IQOS ILUMA tests that you're planning for the U.S. It sounds like just a few cities. Will those be sort of diverse geographically across the U.S.? And what are some of the learnings that you're hoping to, I think, unlock? And how could this be different than what we saw initially several years ago with some of the stand-alone stores that were put in place? And then I have a follow-up.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Sure, Priya. Well, that's a very broad question, although a very important one, of course. So given where we are, I'm going to make a short answer on that one. First of all, we clarify the fact that we go for a scale launch only once we get the PMTA for ILUMA. And as I said in my preliminary remarks, we are still, today, targeting to get this approval in the second half of 2025. Once we are there, then we have the right product to really go broader in the U.S. And at that stage, we will have been learning with a number of things that we're going to do between Q4 and the moment where we go with ILUMA. And it's -- you're asking, okay, what are you going to do differently? Let's -- let's be clear, we don't believe that IQOS has never been launched in a kind of serious, consistent and profound manner. And we believe that what makes IQOS so popular outside the U.S. is going to resonate with a number of smokers among the around 30 million smokers in the U.S. So we're going to develop what has been working elsewhere. It will be about, of course, going to the smokers explaining what IQOS is about, explaining the experience, why IQOS is a better product than smoking. I think it will be, as always, very important to create the image, the brand territory, but also talk about closely with the smokers, okay, this is a journey to move away from smoking and to go to a better product to IQOS. We will have the same commercial, I would say, a machine that has been successful in so many markets with developing our own retail sales point. We will have a strong partnership with a number of independent and third-party retailers. So we're going to pull all the levers and something that has not been done in the U.S. Because until now, it has been only a very limited launch in a few cities with limited actions. So everything is going to start at that moment for IQOS and there won't be any magic. We're going to use what has been working so well elsewhere, of course, adapting it to the U.S. market.\nPriya Ohri-Gupta: That's really helpful. And I guess just a follow-on to that is you talked a lot about the development of IQOS VEEV outside the U.S. Maybe broad strokes, how do you think that product could play out in the U.S.? And at what point would think about filing PMTAs and then broaden the availability of that in the U.S.?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Look, for the time being, we don't have the plan to file a PMTA on these. We are very much focusing on IQOS. I think that this success is just at the beginning today. It's great to have already five markets where we are number 1 on the closed pods system, but it's just the beginning. We're going to keep learning, developing how we can develop a successful, profitable business on vaping. And then we will see whether in due course, it may make sense to have some thoughts for VEEV in the U.S., but we are not at that stage today.\nPriya Ohri-Gupta: Just 1 final, I think, housekeeping item. You talked about your interest expense being at the low end of your prior range, $1.3 billion. Does that reflect, I guess, the issuance you've done to date? And should we anticipate that there wouldn't be any incremental interest expense headwinds, i.e., potential scope for any other refinancing or pre-financing that you might consider?\nEmmanuel Babeau: No. I think the improvement in the estimated financial cost for the year is reflecting a better situation on, first of all, the level of the debt with the cash flow generation. Second, with how we are financing the group. And that is coming with this -- you said it. I mean, we are in the low end of the initial bracket. And I don't think you should expect some kind of revolution in the way we are financing the company, nothing on the agenda.\nOperator: I would now like to hand the call back to James Bushnell for closing remarks.\nJames Bushnell: That concludes our call today. Thank you for joining us. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the PMI Investor Relations team. Thank you again, and have a great day.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Emmanuel Babeau",
            "content": "Thank you, James, and welcome everyone. Our business delivered another outstanding performance in the second quarter of 2024. Our categories were strong across the board to deliver a record H1 on organic top-line growth and on organic OI growth, excluding the pandemic recovery year of 2021. The strong underlying momentum of IQOS continued in Q2, with shipment and adjusted IMS volume growth above or in line with our expectations. This reflects another quarter of strong progress in Japan and robust fundamentals in Europe, despite the volatility of the characterizing flavor ban. With pricing, manufacturing efficiencies and scale benefits, the expanding profit contribution of IQOS is driving excellent growth for PMI. ZYN continued its impressive growth trajectory, with Q2 U.S. volumes growing by over +50% despite recent supply tensions and increased pricing. In addition to IQOS and U.S. ZYN, I am pleased to report building multicategory momentum. While still early days, VEEV has already become the closed pod leader in 5 European markets and is firmly on the path to profitability, while international nicotine pouch volumes grew over plus 60% in H1, matching U.S. growth rates. This progress of smoke-free product is reflected in a rapidly growing consumer base, with around 36.5 million estimated adult users as of June 30, and our products now available across 90 markets worldwide. Our combustible business also overdelivered, with a return to gross margin expansion ahead of plan in Q2 after two years of significant inflationary headwinds. This was driven by stable H1 volumes and category share despite robust pricing, in addition to cost efficiencies. This broad-based delivery translated into double-digit organic OI growth, with significant margin expansion. As we have outlined previously, delivering robust growth in dollar terms is a key priority and we are taking pro-active steps on pricing and cost efficiencies to mitigate currency headwinds. This is clearly evident in our H1 adjusted diluted EPS delivery of mid-single digit growth despite a currency headwind of over 12%, as essentially all of the expected full-year impact fell in the first half. Following this exceptional first half performance, we are increasing our 2024 full year forecasts on all organic dimensions, and for adjusted diluted EPS on both a currency neutral and US dollar basis. This reflects our strong H2 outlook with accelerating adjusted IMS growth for IQOS, sequentially higher ZYN volumes and a stepped-up rate of USD EPS growth, at prevailing exchange rates. Looking at our headline financials, strong total shipment volume growth of plus 2.8% drove Q2 organic net revenue growth of plus 9.6%, or plus 5.6% in dollar terms. Robust top-line growth, positive smoke-free margin mix and ongoing cost efficiencies enabled us to deliver adjusted diluted EPS of $1.59. This represents plus 10.6% growth excluding a larger-than-expected unfavorable currency variance of $0.18, which includes a small transactional impact from exchange rate volatility at quarter end. This better-than-expected ex-currency performance reflects the improving profitability of IQOS, ZYN and combustibles, which I will come back to. Looking at the first half overall, our volumes grew by plus 3.2%, and organic net revenues by plus 10.2%, our highest growth since the 2008 spin. Strong performance from both smoke-free and combustibles drove operating income growth of plus 17% with margin expansion of plus 230 basis points organically, and plus 7.1% growth in dollar terms. We expect continued robust OI growth on both a reported and an organic basis in the second half. H1 adjusted diluted EPS grew by an impressive plus 16.8% in constant currency and by plus 4.0% in dollar terms. The $0.38 unfavorable H1 currency variance includes $0.08 of non-recurring transactional impacts from Egypt and Russia. Focusing now on volume. Total shipment growth in both the quarter and H1 overall reflect smoke-free share gains in a resilient international industry, which grew by more than 1% in both periods, even excluding oral and e-vapor. Q2 HTU shipments of 35.5 billion units exceeded our prior outlook, notably driven by continued strong performance in Japan, robust underlying growth in Europe and promising growth in newer markets, such as Indonesia. In addition to underlying momentum, Q2 saw an incremental phasing impact of around 0.5 billion unit, primarily related to Red Sea disruption. Q2 HTU adjusted IMS volume grew by plus 10.2%, in line with our expectation. This includes the impact of the characterizing flavor ban in Europe, most notably in Italy this quarter. Total smoke-free adjusted in market sales volume grew plus 11.2% in Q2 and plus 13.1% in H1. This includes our oral smoke-free portfolio powered by ZYN with Q2 pouch unit volumes up by plus 20%. U.S. ZYN shipment grew by plus 50% to 135.1 million cans. This does not include the promising result of our e-vapor business where volume grew strongly to the equivalent of 0.7 billion units on a year-to-date basis. Cigarette shipments grew by plus 0.4% with notable positive contribution from Turkey and North Africa. This reflects a stable category share, excluding market mix, despite step-up pricing. With such a positive H1 volume performance, we are raising our full year forecast for total cigarette HTU and oral unit volumes to plus 1% to plus 2%, which would mark our fourth consecutive year of volume growth. The power of our multicategory smoke-free transformation and recovery in combustible are clearly illustrated on this slide, as both areas contributed strongly to double-digits organic OI growth of plus 12.5% for the Group in Q2. Smoke-free continued its excellent momentum with plus 18% organic growth in net revenue and plus 22% in gross profit, driving plus 220 basis points organic gross margin expansion. This reflects the strong performance of ZYN and the growth and scale effect of IQOS, including manufacturing productivities and an increasing all by smaller contribution from VEEV. Expanding smoke-free gross margin continued to widen the gap versus combustible gross margin, enhancing the very positive mix effect of our transformation. However, combustible gross margin expansion is also a key objective. After seven quarters of contraction, we are very pleased to report plus 50 basis point expansion and gross profit growth of plus 5.5% on an organic basis, providing a meaningful contribution to total PMI profitability. This reflects resilient volume despite very strong pricing in addition to ongoing efficiencies and reduced headwinds on our COGS, notwithstanding continued tobacco leaf inflation. We also expect convertible gross margin expansion in H2. Combined with a very strong first quarter, the year-to-date picture is even more compelling with double-digit organic net revenue, gross profit and OI growth. This is driven by the same dynamic as Q2 with an impressive plus 390 basis point gross margin expansion and plus 29% gross profit growth for our smoke-free business. Our H1 revenue performance again demonstrates the powerful drivers of our financial model with an unparalleled combination of positive volumes, robust pricing and the very favorable category mix of our smoke-free product. As mentioned, volume grew by plus 3.2%. Pricing contributed plus 6 points of growth, including plus 8.3% pricing on combustible and around plus 2% on smoke-free. Smoke-free category mix added plus 2.5 points to the top-line, reflecting the higher net revenue per unit of IQOS and ZYN. While it's still small, VEEV also contributed positively to the overall mix. I also note that oral smoke-free product added plus 2 points to organic net revenue progression, underlying the continued accretion from the Swedish Match acquisition. As in recent quarters, geographic mix was negative. This is primarily due to combustible where volumes increasingly skew to lower margin markets, where smoke-free alternatives are small or not available, with higher margin markets over-indexed to cannibalization. We expect this dynamic to be less impactful in 2024 than last year. Now let's focus on the mechanics behind our H1 margin delivery. Gross margin increased organically by 140 basis points and by 80 basis points in dollar terms. This was driven by our higher margin smoke-free business, pricing and ongoing productivity saving across the value chain. As expected, SG&A cost growth stepped-up in Q2, increasing 9.8% organically after a very modest increment in Q1 due to planned phasing of commercial spend. The resulting 5.8% organic increase in H1 was below the rate of top-line growth, driving plus 1 percentage point of margin expansion with our successful back-office cost program able to mitigate some of the investment step up. With a range of important commercial activities in Q3, we expect SG&A to remain elevated but continue to target an organic increase below the rate of net revenue growth for the year. I'm pleased to report we delivered over $300 million in H1 growth cost efficiencies across both COGS and SG&A, as we pro-actively drive bottom-line growth. We expect an acceleration in H2 savings, notably from manufacturing, as we progress towards our $2 billion target for '24, '26 period. The combination of these factors drove a plus 230 basis point expansion in our organic operating income margin. Despite a significant H1-skewed currency headwind, adjusted OI margin were stable on a dollar basis. Moving to our smoke-free business. We estimate there were 36.5 million adult users of PMI smoke-free product as of June 30th, reflecting an addition of 3.2 million during H1. This includes an estimated 30.8 million IQOS users, 5.2 million oral users and 0.8 million VEEV users. The increase in both total and IQOS users was broad-based with notable progress in Japan, Europe and newer growth markets, such as Indonesia, in addition to ZYN's strong traction with legal-age nicotine user in the U.S. Our smoke-free products are now present in 90 markets following recent launches of IQOS, ZYN and VEEV. Focusing now on IQOS in Europe, where fundamental dynamics are developing very well including the user growth I just mentioned. First, we see robust recoveries in markets, where the characterizing flavor ban has passed the initial adjustment phase. Second, there is continued excellent growth in markets where IQOS is already well-established such as Portugal, Hungary and Greece. Last, new growth leader markets are emerging with accelerating momentum in Germany, Spain, Bulgaria and Romania in addition to recovery in Poland, following the launch of DELIA. Our Q2 HTU share increased by 0.8 points year-on-year despite the impact of the flavor ban, due to the usual seasonal factors and the resilient combustible market, Q2 share was sequentially below Q1. HTU adjusted IMS volume demonstrated robust growth, growing by 0.8 billion units sequentially to reach 12.9 billion on a four quarter moving average. As expected, adjusted in market sales growth of plus 6.8% was lower than in Q1 due to higher comparison and the initial impact of the characterizing flavor ban, notably in Italy. Growth excluding Italy was close to 10%. The impact of the ban is progressing in line with our prior estimate in the majority of markets, though the implementation in Italy during Q2 was slightly more pronounced than anticipated. This was primarily driven by earlier sell-through of affected SKUs and concurrent pricing. It is important to note, this is a transitory dynamic and I'm pleased to report a recovery in markets such as Greece, Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Romania where the ban was implemented previously following an initial period of consumer adjustment. Indeed, despite an uncertain outlook in Ukraine, we anticipate an acceleration in Europe adjusted IMS growth in the second half. This is supported by the planned step-up in commercial activity behind IQOS, including the introduction of DELIA and LEVIA HTUs to an increasing number of markets. Another illustration of our continued progress in Europe is in our key city offtake share. Strong gains in city with already high IQOS adoption such as Budapest, Bucharest, Bratislava, Lisbon and Sofia; and historically slower growth markets such as Madrid, London and Amsterdam, highlight the enduring growth potential in the region. Japan demonstrated impressive IQOS growth in the quarter, with adjusted HTU IMS growth of plus 12.5%, representing the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit progression. Adjusted IMS volumes continued to grow sequentially, reaching 10.5 billion units on a four-quarter moving average. Total tobacco share for our HTU brand increased by 3.1 points year-on-year to 29.4% with national offtake share exceeding the impressive milestone of 30% in June. We also maintained offtake share of over 35% in Tokyo despite seasonal factors, where the overall category continued to track at over 50% of total offtake and grow sequentially, demonstrating the continued potential in this important market. Our continuous innovation is a key driver of this growth, with Q2 seeing a strong step-up in user acquisition following the launch of ILUMA i, and further innovative TEREA variants such as capsule consumables. Taking a more global view, we continue to see very promising IQOS growth across a broad range of geographies, including low and middle income market as highlighted by key city offtake shares. Accelerating growth in Indonesia, the world's largest cigarette market by volume excluding China, leads the way with increasing geographic reach and Clove HTU innovation. Markets across North Africa and the Middle East are also a growing weight and source of growth. We show Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia here in addition to Egypt where performance in Cairo remains robust despite recent pricing and a recovery in the combustible market. I am also pleased to report very good progress in the UAE and Jordan. Following the recent launch of ILUMA, growth in Mexico City is very promising and the East Asian market of South Korea and Malaysia continue to perform well. Also worth highlighting is the successful contribution of Duty Free, where we are increasingly leveraging our multi-category portfolio to expand share in a growing market as travel recovers in Asia. Our fundamental HTU growth outlook for the year has not changed. H1 adjusted IMS growth of plus 11.4% reflects the strong dynamic I described across Japan, Europe, and global markets, partly offset by the transitory impact of the EU flavor ban. Indeed, growth excluding Europe accelerated compared to the last year and we expect this to continue. However, we see an incremental headwind of around 2 billion units to our full year adjusted IMS forecasts, the majority of which is driven by the ongoing delay in approval for commercialization in Taiwan, which was previously expected around the midpoint of the year. We also factor in an impact of a few hundred million units for a slower recovery from the characterizing flavor ban in Europe, principally in Italy. I would note that our revised full year forecast for adjusted IMS growth of around 13% represents the same absolute volume increase as 2023 despite the EU headwind. We accordingly forecast full year HTU shipment volume of around 140 billion units with shipment as usual expected to be a few billion units higher than adjusted IMS given continued offtake and user growth. Importantly, we expect a very strong H2 delivery in adjusted IMS on both sequential and year-on-year basis to between plus 14% and plus 15% growth. This is supported by a notable step-up in commercial activity, continued momentum in Japan and increasingly dynamic global markets. These include the markets I just mentioned and the ongoing acceleration in Duty Free. For Europe, the broadening of growth acceleration in Germany, Spain, the UK, & Romania adds to the ongoing momentum in geographies such as Portugal and Greece. H2 should also see several markets start to rebound from initial flavor ban impact, including a gradual recovery in Italy. Turning now to ZYN, where very good U.S. progress continued in Q2 with close to plus 70% growth in 12-months rolling shipments. As we shared earlier in the year, strong demand dynamics have created short-term supply chain constraints, which has impacted volume growth. As shown on this slide, this has resulted in a temporary slowdown of the category. ZYN's premium positioning and superior brand equity remained strong, with ZYN maintaining very robust category volume and value share, despite these availability challenges and the recent price increase. We also remain highly-focused on marketing ZYN responsibly to prevent unintended use. We are making good progress on expanding production and continue to expect a gradual improvement through Q3, with sequentially higher volume and for production volumes to meet expected consumer demand during the course of Q4. We expect the ongoing expansion of the existing facility in Kentucky to provide around 900 million cans of capacity for 2025. We also recently announced a planned investment in a new plant in Colorado, which is due to begin preliminary operation by the end of next year. Together, these plans support our U.S. growth ambitions for the coming years. For 2024, we are now forecasting a U.S. shipment range of 560 million to 580 million cans, to reflect strongly increasing demand from adult nicotine user and the progress made on increasing our production capacity. I will now take a moment to update you on the international expansion of our smoke-free business. Our multicategory approach is gaining momentum, as we unlock new horizon of growth with increasing commercialization of IQOS, ZYN and VEEV across markets. Our focused strategy for VEEV is showing very good early results. In Europe, closed pods are accelerating within the dynamic e-vapor category. We are seeing strong traction of our VEEV ONE product, achieving a number one closed pod position in five markets within the first year of launch including Italy, the Czech Republic and Romania. We continue to observe good repeat purchase and conversion rate, which is often a challenge for this category. We continue to expect good production and conversion rate which is often challenge for this category. We expect continued volume momentum in H2, supported by ongoing geographic expansion and to reach profitability in Q3. For ZYN, there is a large opportunity outside of the U.S., which we are working to capture. Our international nicotine pot volume, including the Nordics, grew by over plus 60% in H1, matching U.S. ZYN growth. We see promising results in a number of markets, including Mexico, South Africa, Pakistan and the important UK market where we have seen strong traction with only limited distribution so far. Our expansion of the IQOS portfolio remains active as we innovate to broaden and enhance our offer for both existing user and switching other smokers. Further market launches are planned in H2 including DELIA and LEVIA HTUs and the new ILUMA i device range which is currently only available in Japan. We also continue with our preparation for IQOS ILUMA in the U. S. And we are underway with consumer engagement for our first city pilot in Austin, Texas with the IQOS 3 system, which we expect to start in Q4. As mentioned previously, the commercialization will be initially limited in scope and focused on direct activation of select legal edge smokers in a few cities, allowing us to experiment with different elements of the commercial model. The main purpose is to fine tune our approach and readiness in anticipation of the at scale launch of ILUMA. We continue to assume an authorization from the FDA in the second half of 2025. Focusing now on combustibles. Our portfolio delivered robust organic net revenue growth and a very positive profit contribution as I covered earlier. This reflects resilient volume despite very strong Q2 pricing of plus 8.7% including our proactive action to maximize growth. It is worth noting the large majority of our pricing is derived from regular pricing action unrelated to significant currency devaluation. Factoring the strong H1 and favorable outlook, we now forecast an increased fully combustible price variance of plus 7% to plus 8%. Our cigarette category share was stable in H1 and down 0.2 in Q2, or stable excluding market mix impact. Lower share in Egypt and Indonesia was offset by positive contribution from Turkey, India and the Europe region, again despite strong pricing. Our global brand grew category share in the quarter with Marlboro gaining plus 0.3 points to 10.1%. On a global basis, our leadership in combustible is a critical enabler to maximize switching to smoke-free product, and we target a stable category share over time. As mentioned previously, we evaluate our strategy on a market-by-market basis and have the flexibility to adapt our approach where smoke-free products have already reached critical mass. Taking a more holistic view on the business. Our transformation and smoke-free journey are backed by a strategy that seeks to embed sustainability in all that we do. We are making strong progress towards our product transformation targets. Our smoke-free products are now available in 90 markets, placing us on-track for our aspiration of 100 by 2025. We are also moving nicely towards our objective for low and middle income countries to comprise over 50% of smoke-free product market. The rapid growth of our estimated SFP user base, which now stands at around 36.5 million adult users, as previously described, is further testament to this progress. With regard to our operation, decarbonization is an important focus area and we are very pleased to have been awarded the top spot on the Forbes' 2024 Net Zero Leaders list, which highlights the 100 U.S. public companies best positioned to reduce their greenhouse gas emission. It also follows the announcement earlier this year of CDP awarding us a triple-A rating for our disclosure and efforts on climate change, forest and water security. This recognition reflects our continued focus on our sustainability performance and robust reporting, as we continue to work towards a smoke-free future. This bring me to our outlook for 2024. Following an excellent H1 performance and strong business momentum, as we start the second half, we are raising our full year currency neutral and U.S. dollar growth forecast. This is supported by accelerated total volume growth and pricing and reflects the very strong outlook for ZYN, despite short-term supply constraint and the increasing profitability of IQOS due to operating leverage, manufacturing efficiencies and pricing. We continue to target close to $15 billion in smoke-free net revenue for the year. Taking these factors into account and robust combustible performance, we are increasing our organic net revenue growth forecast to a range of plus 7.5% to plus 9%. In addition to strong top-line growth, the positive smoke-free mix effect, combustible recovery and further cost efficiency enable healthy margin expansion. We are accordingly raising our organic operating income growth forecast to plus 11% to plus 13% for the year. We continue to target adjusted gross margin expansion for both smoke-free product and combustible, and adjusted OI margin expansion for total PMI, all in both organic and dollar terms. Consequently, and also factoring a lower forecast net financing cost, we are raising our forecast for currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth to plus 11% to plus 13%. This translates into a range of $6.33 to $6.45 including an unfavorable currency impact of $0.34 for the year at prevailing rates. The increased currency headwind versus prior guidance is primarily due to the Q2 impact already described. As shown by the increase in our forecast U.S. EPS growth to plus 5% to plus 7%, the underlying strength of our business and proactive mitigating actions have allowed us to more-than-compensate for this, and we expect to deliver on our objective of strong growth in dollar terms. Focusing on the second half in more detail. We expect another strong performance driven by excellent IQOS adjusted IMS growth, the progressive improvement in ZYN volume and continued positive impact from our actions to drive bottom-line growth. For Q3, we forecast a record high quarterly adjusted diluted EPS of $1.77 to $1.82 despite a significant step-up in commercial spending and an unfavorable currency impact of $0.02 at prevailing rates. This is in contrast to a forecast currency tailwind of $0.04 for H2 overall, which enables us to target accelerated U. S. dollar adjusted diluted EPS growth. We include a table of estimated currency impact by quarter in the appendix. This Q3 forecast notably reflects another quarter of dynamic growth with HTU shipment of 34 billion to 35 billion units and an acceleration in HTU adjusted IMS growth. Given expectation for a strong full year profit delivery, we are forecasting operating cash flow of around $11 billion which is at the upper end of our previous forecast range at prevailing exchange rate and subject to year-end working capital requirement. We expect this improvement to more than offset an increase in capital expenditure to around $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion as we further accelerate ZYN capacity expansion. Last, we continue to target 0.3x to 0.5x improvement in our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio in 2024, driven by profit growth and strong cash flow generation. As of June 30, we have already improved a ratio of 3x on a 12-month trailing basis as compared to 3.2x at the end of 2023. This represents good progress towards our target of around 2x by the end of 2026. We intend to reconsider share repurchase subject to board approval once we are within sight of this goal. I will now conclude today's presentation with some closing remarks. The powerful combination of strong underlying business momentum and our own proactive steps enable us to generate best-in-class growth across key metrics. Our strategy is delivering on volumes, pricing, cash flow and dollar earnings despite ongoing currency headwinds. The success of our smoke free transformation is reflected in our remarkable first half performance with excellent underlying IQOS and ZYN growth, very robust pricing, positive category mix and stepped-up cost efficiencies. This puts us firmly on track for an exceptional 2024 with accelerated top line growth and margin expansion. Our momentum is broadening across the business with exciting multi-category growth opportunity to further support the delivery of our 2024-2026 growth targets. We remain highly focused on delivering performance in dollar. And as shown in H1, we are taking measures to mitigate currency headwinds. Finally, we are steadfastly committed to returning cash to our shareholders. Our growth outlook and strong cash flow generation underpins our capital allocation priorities to reinvest behind our rapidly transforming business alongside our progressive dividend policy. Thank you, and we are now very happy to answer your questions. Thank you, Gaurav, for the question. Look, let's be clear. We can always challenge us on whether we could do even better in terms of price increase. The fact is that we are doing better than what we thought initially. We have this very strong performance, 8.7% price increase for combustible for H1. I think we all know that the inflationary environment is no longer what it was last year. So obviously, this is a very strong performance. Please bear in mind, I said it in my preliminary remarks, but around 3/4 of that is not coming from inflation in -- sorry, from a price increase in a country with very high inflation. And this 8.7% in Q2 is largely driven by the markets where we are really driving price on a kind of opportunistic basis, building on the strength of our portfolio and making sure that we are ever optimizing the potential for price increase. So you can be absolutely sure that this is a very granular work, market by market each time as we signal, we take into account what is our position on smoke-free product on this market, what is the impact of increasing price. And I think we can demonstrate that we have a very successful approach on this price increase. So I would tend to believe that we are optimizing this price increase potential in the current environment. Look, I'm confirming that we have the objective to be around 900 million can of production capacity for next year, that's for the full year 2025. We are gradually improving our capacity, and there is a number of steps that we are taking. I'm not going to elaborate on them, but there are several levers that we are pulling to increase this capacity. So I would say every quarter versus the previous one, we are improving the capacity. I'm not going to give a prediction on where we're going to be at the end of the year. We believe, given what we see from the potential consumer demand today, that in terms of what we produce at a certain point in Q4 versus what the consumer offtake could be without restriction, we're going to be good. And then we'll see exactly how we finish in terms of capacity at the end of the year. But I think what is more relevant and, frankly, more important is you have the picture of this 560 million to 580 million can. That is our goal for 2024. You know that we have this capacity for 900 million cans for next year. Let's be clear, it's not a guidance on the volume for next year. We're just here giving the capacity on which we are working. And I think with that, you have what is important. Sure, Bonnie. Thank you for maybe giving me the opportunity to further clarify the dynamic and the good dynamics that we are seeing behind IQOS. So we are indeed revising, first of all, our objective of adjusted in-market sales by around 2 billion. I've been clarifying that the majority of that is coming from Taiwan, okay? So in fact, it's really the fact that we were expecting Taiwan to start more than 6 months this year. And it's -- at the end of the day, today, we are making here the assumption that at the end of the day, it's going to be zero volume in Taiwan. We thought it was a reasonable assumption. Remember the law allowing for heated tobacco product was passed now 15 months ago. So we thought that during this period of time, there was this capacity to get the approval from the regulator. And there is an administrative process, asking question, you have Q&A. It's just taking much more time than what we thought. But first and foremost, the reason for this 2 billion revision on adjusted IMS is Taiwan. Then in addition to that, we have this a few hundred million that is coming from Europe. So that's really all you should understand, the 2 billion. And because of Taiwan, we are indeed saying when we were expecting to be above 140 billion in terms of shipments. We are now expecting to be around 140 billion. Again, that's the way you should understand the revision on the guidance. But let me take 2 minutes to explain the dynamic because I want to make sure that things are very clear. What we've been seeing in H1 is, in fact, an acceleration of the IQOS business outside Europe. So if you look at the adjusted in-market sales outside Europe, and we talk about 60% of the business, the adjusted IMS were growing around 14% versus around 13% last year. So we've been growing faster in percentage. So you can imagine in terms of volume, of course, that means a significant acceleration. And indeed, what is beyond this very nice dynamism is Japan. You have other developed markets such as South Korea, but we've been seeing a number of new contributor to this growth. We mentioned Indonesia. We mentioned a number of markets in Middle East. Mexico is also accelerating, and we enjoy also a nice performance in duty-free. So that's really what we are seeing outside Europe. Then Europe, absolutely as expected. I mean, we are going through what is a significant transition. We are moving away from flavor. It's still growing. Outside Italy, we have adjusted in-market sales growing close to double-digits. So very strong in dynamism despite the fact that many of the country are going through this transition. And as we flagged, it is true that it's really great to see, at the same time, our champion market, like we mentioned in Portugal, Hungary that continue to do very well. We have new markets that are really confirming their status of growth driver for the future. We mentioned Germany, Spain, Romania, Bulgaria. So it's important to have this new growth provider, if you want. And then a number of markets exiting, I would say, as expected, the turmoil or the disruption, I would say, of a few weeks that is coming with -- with the implementation of the flavor ban. And here, we can mention Greece, we can mention Romania, we can mention Bulgaria, we can mention Czech Republic. So a number of markets where things are happening absolutely as expected. And then you have Italy, where we've been, in fact, not evaluating well the level of flavored products available with distributor and with retail, and there was less than what we thought. And therefore, the consumer offtake has been impacted quicker than what we were anticipating by the absence of a flavor product after the implementation of the flavor ban, and that has had some impact on the growth. And at the same time, no doubt that the 2 accumulating have had some impact. We've been increasing price by $0.30 on our consumables. And that has not been followed only very marginally by the competition with some impact on our market share as it happens when we increase price in a meaningful manner, widening the gap with competition and the competition not following. So that is really the picture. And now when we are looking at the second half, so we expect outside Europe situation to continue to do well. I'm not going to name again all these very great country where we are performing extremely well. We have the launch of LEVIA and DELIA in a number of countries. And we expect Europe to accelerate as we are transitioning out of this phase of adjustment to the flavor ban. And Italy will be part of the market where we expect improvement. But I would say, globally, we expect more acceleration on all the markets that have been going through the flavor ban. So I think this is really the complete picture, Bonnie. I hope it is helpful in answering your question. Sure, Bonnie. So you're right. ILUMA i, so the latest generation of IQOS ILUMA. So it does not change the fundamental technology, but the -- the device is offering a number of additional functionalities, is, for the time being, only present in Japan. There was the launch in a few other countries that is planned for H2. And it's always difficult to say what this new product is triggering, but we've been seeing clearly a new acquisition of IQOS user. We've been seeing consumer sentiment going up with some very good reaction to this product. So I would say we continue to have more ammunition to convert smokers to IQOS, to improve the experience, to improve customer satisfaction that is triggering of course, more loyalty that can have some impact on the average daily consumption, so a number of positive effects. That's what we have seen in Japan. Difficult for me to tell you exactly by how much this has been further accelerating the growth in Japan, but now that was a positive for the market. Sure. So as a coincidence, I suppose that it is true that in H1, the growth in nicotine pouch outside the U.S. was very similar to the 1 in the U.S., what chart. It's -- we talk about 10% only of the volume in the U.S. That is included. It's not totally nothing because that is including the Nordics. And what we are clearly seeing is that there is from the nicotine user, some interest and attraction in many countries. And I tend to really put 3 buckets of possible growth for this market. You have, of course, first, the Nordic country that have the knowledge, the understanding the culture of this product and where the nicotine pouch category is dynamic. And here, we want to take our fair share of the growth. Then you have Europe, where the category is not relevant in all markets, but we can already flag a number of countries such as Austria, the U.K., Switzerland, where we believe that there is potential, and we see the growth. And then you have, I would say, global market, international market. We can name Pakistan, we can name South Africa. We could talk about Indonesia and the Philippines, where we see potential for these nicotine pouches. You may have some culture already of overall product. And we see some development of the product. I could add Mexico to the list, by the way, where we are starting nicely the development of ZYN. So we see that this product maybe because of the U.S. influence, I think in the case of some country like the U.K., it's clear. That's a category that could grow in awareness, I would say, interestingly and rapidly, and we want absolutely to make sure that we're going to capture our fair share of this opportunity. No, there is no capacity issue that I have to report at that stage. Sure. And you want to ask a question on ZYN now? Or you want to come back on ZYN after? Okay. So on the vaping category, I think what we are seeing is that with what we've always been saying, the vaping category is a legitimate category to be an alternative to people who would otherwise smoke. And therefore, that is a category that is growing, not necessarily faster than burnt, not faster than nicotine pouch for sure. But of course, the basis for nicotine pouch is smaller. And we know that the vaping category is more appealing for people legal age and above that want to start consuming nicotine and it's much more difficult to convert smokers. And that's clearly what IQOS and the heat-not-burn category is doing much better. So yes, the vaping can be appealing for some legal age and above nicotine user. More difficult to convert smokers, very clearly. We haven't seen any meaningful report of people moving to vaping and a change of kind of dynamic in the category following the implementation of the flavor ban in Europe. Of course, we are monitoring that. But as I said, there is nothing that we can obviously report on that trend, which probably could confirm that we talk about people that are probably with different profile, but that's something that we will have to keep monitoring, of course. So we've always been saying that the concern with the vaping category is that if the products are not properly developed and marketed. If there is an unreasonable appeal to flavor, what that can trigger unintended usage, and that is a problem for the category. And we are very happy with our growth because we do that in a very responsible manner, both in terms of development of our product, development of our marketing activity. And we are developing this responsible approach, very much based on our commercial strength and a great product. I think VEEV ONE is a great product, and strong partnership with the trade that is giving this very good start as we mentioned, the number 1 position in five countries for close pods. That's really what I can share with you at that stage. Look, on ZYN, I think we mentioned the fact that we are clearly with some restrictions. So I'm not sure that what you read in the Nielsen, which corresponds to the availability is going a view on the trend and the consumer demand, we are gradually improving, and we expect to see that in the coming months, the availability. Today, we clarify that we are working with a target of around 900 million can capacity for next year. So we are creating very nice headroom for growth for the coming quarters. And we think it's really important. I'm not going to be able to tell you because, frankly, it's impossible to say what would have been the growth rate without the limitation. Please bear in mind that there were some competitors move in term of pricing last year that triggered an acceleration in our market share, and that the effect is now behind us. So it is also having some impact on the year-on-year comparison. So that's what we can say on ZYN. Yes, I know, there is nothing new. We keep working and fully cooperating, of course, with the Attorney General. And at that stage, it's impossible to say how long the work will take or what will be the conclusion. And there is nothing new today. So you're alluding to product that would come from non-U.S. market, correct? That's what... Look, I don't have any information about that. So I cannot make any comment or report. I think we are doing everywhere we can, our utmost to ensure that the flows are appropriate and not going where they should not be going. And we are working very hard with this objective. And I don't have any data and I cannot react on that. But our position is very clear. We are very strict on doing everything we can to make sure that this parallel flows are not happening. On your question on -- if I understand you well, Owen, could -- do we see the same kind of phenomenon on nicotine pouch than the 1 we are seeing on vaping, which is illicit parallel flow that would be entering the U.S. market? Today, from what we can monitor in the market, we are not having the feeling that there is anything material at that stage. But of course, we are monitoring that very carefully. If it was to become material, I think what we are clearly seeing today is that the authorities take that seriously, and they are starting to have much more action and be much more alert on the topic. So I would expect them to have the same behavior when it comes to nicotine pouches. So to summarize, I don't think we're seeing anything meaningful today to be certainly watched. And if it was to become the case, we would expect the authority to have the same, I would say, proactive behavior that they -- I think they are starting to implement on vaping. Thank you, Callum. Look, again, I don't have any data on what you're saying. So it's very difficult for me to report. I think we know whether the product that benefit from the situation and the positioning in 2016 in the market and that, therefore, are legally being commercialized. As you can imagine, I'm going to repeat only what I said. We are doing everything we can to control the flows. I don't have information today saying that you have these flows of product. If we knew, we would certainly tackle that, and we would try to understand where it's coming from. And what I can certainly repeat is that our objective is to do our utmost, everything we can to be compliant with the regulation. And there is nothing else I can say, really. Look, Callum, this is obviously coming from a mix of consumer demand perception that we have. And we believe that if we can produce them, there is a space to get to 580 million can shipments. That's the first element. And that's what our senses are telling us about, what consumer would be happy to buy if it was available. And at the same time, of course, our measures to increase production capacity, where, as I said, I'm not going to elaborate on the various levers, but we're pulling a number of levers to progressively increase the capacity for ZYN production in the U.S. So that's really the combination of the 2. Sure, Priya. Well, that's a very broad question, although a very important one, of course. So given where we are, I'm going to make a short answer on that one. First of all, we clarify the fact that we go for a scale launch only once we get the PMTA for ILUMA. And as I said in my preliminary remarks, we are still, today, targeting to get this approval in the second half of 2025. Once we are there, then we have the right product to really go broader in the U.S. And at that stage, we will have been learning with a number of things that we're going to do between Q4 and the moment where we go with ILUMA. And it's -- you're asking, okay, what are you going to do differently? Let's -- let's be clear, we don't believe that IQOS has never been launched in a kind of serious, consistent and profound manner. And we believe that what makes IQOS so popular outside the U.S. is going to resonate with a number of smokers among the around 30 million smokers in the U.S. So we're going to develop what has been working elsewhere. It will be about, of course, going to the smokers explaining what IQOS is about, explaining the experience, why IQOS is a better product than smoking. I think it will be, as always, very important to create the image, the brand territory, but also talk about closely with the smokers, okay, this is a journey to move away from smoking and to go to a better product to IQOS. We will have the same commercial, I would say, a machine that has been successful in so many markets with developing our own retail sales point. We will have a strong partnership with a number of independent and third-party retailers. So we're going to pull all the levers and something that has not been done in the U.S. Because until now, it has been only a very limited launch in a few cities with limited actions. So everything is going to start at that moment for IQOS and there won't be any magic. We're going to use what has been working so well elsewhere, of course, adapting it to the U.S. market. Look, for the time being, we don't have the plan to file a PMTA on these. We are very much focusing on IQOS. I think that this success is just at the beginning today. It's great to have already five markets where we are number 1 on the closed pods system, but it's just the beginning. We're going to keep learning, developing how we can develop a successful, profitable business on vaping. And then we will see whether in due course, it may make sense to have some thoughts for VEEV in the U.S., but we are not at that stage today. No. I think the improvement in the estimated financial cost for the year is reflecting a better situation on, first of all, the level of the debt with the cash flow generation. Second, with how we are financing the group. And that is coming with this -- you said it. I mean, we are in the low end of the initial bracket. And I don't think you should expect some kind of revolution in the way we are financing the company, nothing on the agenda. Thank you."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, James Bushnell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJames Bushnell: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2024 first quarter results. The press release is available on our website at pmi.com. A glossary of terms, including the definition for smoke-free products, as well as adjustments, other calculations, and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures for non-GAAP financial measures cited in this presentation, are available in Exhibit 99.2 to the company's Form 8-K dated April 23, 2024, and on our Investor Relations website. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. I'm joined today by Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer, and Jennifer Motles, Chief Sustainability Officer. Over to you, Emmanuel.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, James, and welcome, everyone. In Q1, we delivered outstanding performance that exceeded our expectations with double-digit growth in organic net revenue and operating income, as well as currency-neutral adjusted diluted earnings per share, all supported by robust volume growth. Excellent smoke- free business momentum continues with plus 25% organic growth in net revenues and plus 38% in gross profit, as IQOS operating leverage and ZYN mix contribute positively. IQOS continues to advance rapidly, with growth of 13% in adjusted in market sales volumes and plus 21% in shipments. IQOS ILUMA is a key driver of this progress and is now available in 64 markets, representing nearly 100% of IQOS volumes outside Russia. ZYN also continued its considerable growth in Q1, with U.S. volumes up plus 80%. Importantly, this top-line performance translated into strong operating income growth and margin expansion, both organically and in dollar terms. This was notably driven by accelerating profitability in both our IQOS and ZYN businesses, in addition to improving combustible performance. We faced higher-than-expected currency headwinds in the quarter, primarily due to the devaluation of the Egyptian pound. We are taking mitigating actions including additional pricing and accelerated cost initiatives, which allowed us to deliver Q1 adjusted diluted EPS above our prior expectation, despite these pressures. While the prior year quarter was favorable for certain growth comparisons, this exceptional start to the year sets the stage for us to deliver significantly better-than- expected 2024 currency-neutral growth, and robust growth in U.S. dollar at prevailing rates. Turning to the headline numbers, very good shipment volume growth of plus 3.6% supported organic top-line growth of plus 11.0%, or plus 8.6% including currency. This reflects continued excellent IQOS and ZYN momentum as well as strong combustible pricing. Operating income grew by plus 22.2% organically versus a softer prior-year quarter, notably driven by gross margin expansion and a deceleration in SG&A growth. As a result, our organic OI margins expanded by plus 3.7 percentage points. In dollar terms, adjusted OI grew by plus 11.3% and adjusted OI margins expanded by 90 basis points. We outperformed our Q1 adjusted EPS outlook due to three main factors. The first is the net revenue and profit impact of better volumes following the industry-leading performance of ZYN, the strong shipment growth of IQOS HTUs including some higher-than-expected timing benefits, and a resilient combustible delivery. Second is the benefit of our pricing actions to mitigate currency headwinds and third is on cost including some timing benefit and a stepped-up focus on manufacturing and back office efficiencies to prioritize growth investments. The majority of the outperformance was driven by underlying business dynamics, which bodes well for the remainder of the year. Indeed, we delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.50, representing plus 23.2% growth excluding an unfavorable currency impact of $0.20. This includes $0.09 from the devaluation of the Egyptian pound, including a transactional impact of $0.06 primarily related to the balance sheet remeasurement of foreign currency payables. With increased liquidity in the Egyptian pounds, we are now reducing our balance sheet exposure, and this should be complete in the coming weeks. Focusing now on volumes, our Q1 HTU shipments of 33.1 billion units exceeded our outlook, with robust underlying growth across geographies and a higher-than- anticipated timing impact of shipments to Japan. The incremental phasing impact was around 1 billion units and was primarily related to Red Sea disruption. While uncertain, we assume this will normalize in the second half of the year. As mentioned previously, we believe the best indicator of underlying HTU growth is adjusted in market sales, as the closest metric to consumer offtake. Adjusted IMS volume grew nicely by plus 12.5%, including the expected impact from the characterizing flavor ban in Europe. We continue to see strong IQOS momentum, with excellent growth in Japan, robust underlying fundamentals in Europe, and a growing contribution from newer markets such as Indonesia. We continue to target plus 14% to plus 16% adjusted IMS growth for the year, with around plus 10% growth in Q2 followed by an H2 acceleration driven by the timing of commercial programs, ILUMA uptake, newer markets and a less demanding prior year comparison. Total smoke-free volume growth of plus 22% includes the impressive expansion of our oral smoke-free portfolio powered by ZYN, with pouch equivalent shipment volumes up by plus 35.8%. U.S. ZYN shipments grew by plus 80% to 132 million cans. Cigarette shipments declined by a modest 0.4% in the first quarter, with a notable positive contribution from Turkey as we increased share in a strong overall market. Let me now walk through the drivers of our Q1 net revenues. As I mentioned, volumes grew by a remarkable 3.6%, including oral. Pricing contributed plus 5.5 points of growth primarily from combustibles, as well as pricing of around plus 3% on HTUs. Smoke-free category mix added plus 3.1 percentage points to the top-line, reflecting the higher net revenue per unit of IQOS and, to an even greater extent, ZYN. Oral smoke-free product overall boosted our organic net revenue growth by plus 2.2 points, showcasing its role as a meaningful accelerator. To report a positive contribution from our VEEV e-vapor business which, while still small in the context of the group, delivered good revenue growth. As in 2023, there was a negative geographic mix within our combustible business as lower margin markets, often without smoke-free products, grew faster; and smoke-free products accelerated cigarette declines elsewhere. The positive category mix impact of smoke-free products, overall volume growth, and pricing are the three enduring engines of our transformation and growth. Focusing now on the key dynamics of our Q1 profit delivery, smoke-free gross profit grew by an impressive plus 38% organically, on top-line growth of 25%. This reflects the very strong performance of U.S. ZYN and the growth and scale effects of IQOS, including manufacturing productivities. This strong underlying acceleration was amplified by only a few percentage points due to HTU shipment phasing. Gross margins expanded substantially for both heat-not-burn and oral nicotine, and by a striking plus 600 basis points organically for smoke-free overall, which made up close to 39% of total gross profit, an increase of plus 6 percentage points versus prior year. Combustible organic gross profit growth was notably improved and exceeded our expectation at plus 2.3%. Gross margins were also better-than-anticipated, leading to an improved full year outlook. Resilient volumes, strong pricing and manufacturing productivities more than offset the continued cost pressures in the category, geographic mix, and the impact of IQOS cannibalization. As previously flagged, cost increases in leaf, wages and certain other inputs carried over into 2024, and these should ease next year. We were also impacted by around $30 million of costs from implementation of the EU Single-Use Plastics Directive, primarily on cigarettes. A key feature of Q1 was strong operating income margin expansion. Gross margins increased organically by 150 basis points and by 80 basis points including currency. This reflects excellent expansion within smoke-free products, their growing weight within our business at higher margins, and the better-than-expected evolution of combustibles. These factors, combined with productivity savings, significantly outweighed the unfavorable technical dilutive impact of third-party manufacturing in Indonesia, which equated to 30 basis points in the quarter. For SG&A costs, currency-neutral growth of only plus 1.4% drove 220 basis points of organic margin expansion. This benefitted from our resource allocation and prioritization programs, including the delivery of approximately $160 million in gross cost efficiencies across COGS and SG&A towards our $2 billion target for 2024-2026. Although the Q1 margin impact of SG&A cost evolution including currency was small due notably to Egyptian Pound transactional currency, we continue to target SG&A progression below top-line growth for the year. We expect higher organic SG&A increases in the remainder of 2024, notably reflecting investment spend phasing, which was favorable in Q1. The combination of these factors powered a remarkable plus 370 basis point expansion in our organic operating income margins, and plus 90 basis points including currency. This exceeded our expectation and we are now raising our full-year operating income growth outlook, as I will come back to. Taking another lens on adjusted operating income margins by geography, we see broad-based global momentum with all regions delivering strong organic progress. In dollar terms, margins expanded in every region except the South and Southeast Asia, CIS, and Middle East Africa region, mainly reflecting the transactional currency impact of the Egyptian pound and the technical dilution in Indonesia. Indeed, excluding these factors, this region grew margins at a very similar rate to the group. Moving to IQOS. With ILUMA now widely launched, PMI HTUs continue to strengthen their position as the second largest nicotine 'brand' in markets where IQOS is present. PMI HTUs now exceed the 10% market share milestone on the prior basis excluding Indonesia, which we now include following broader commercialization in the market. Our HTUs are the number on nicotine 'brand' in 11 markets, and as shown at CAGNY, IQOS net revenues have surpassed those of Marlboro. Focusing on IQOS in Europe, Q1 HTU share increased by plus 0.9 points, also crossing the 10% regional share milestone for the first time. While still early in many markets, the growing availability and uptake of ILUMA is a key driver and we are seeing a strong acceleration in a number of historically slower-growth markets. Adjusted IMS volumes continue to exhibit robust sequential growth and reached a record high of 12.6 billion units on a four-quarter moving average. This reflects year-on-year progression of plus 9.4% in Q1, with excellent growth in Greece, Portugal, Germany, Spain, UK and the Netherlands. Growth was slower in certain Central European markets such as Poland and Czech Republic, where increased economic pressures and price-sensitivity are visible. We continue to evolve our portfolio in these markets under the recently-launched ILUMA system to drive further growth. Excluding Ukraine, where growth was absent, adjusted in market sales grew double-digit. As anticipated, the 11 markets so far affected by EU characterizing flavor restrictions saw an impact in line with our total region estimate of around 2 billion sticks for the year. Consistent with similar past situations, we observe an initial consumer adjustment followed by a reversion of growth rates to previous levels. We have not seen meaningful shifts towards e-vapor or competitor heat-not-burn products, and we expect the structural growth of IQOS to fuel continued HTU progression over the rest of the year. The strong fundamental progress in the region is highlighted by the expansion in key city offtake shares. Very strong gains in cities with already high IQOS adoption, such as Lisbon, Rome, Athens and Budapest, demonstrate the potential for further growth at the national level. The recent acceleration in London, Madrid, Munich and Amsterdam is also very promising for the IQOS brand in these markets and for Europe overall. In Japan, the adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by an excellent plus 3.1 points to 29.3%. Adjusted IMS volumes increased by plus 13%, maintaining the rapid progress of recent quarters. Such impressive growth in a market with already-high category penetration is a clear testament to the sustainable growth potential of IQOS around the world. In connection with IQOS' strong brand equity and commercial footprint, we are fostering growth through continued innovation on both devices and consumables. In March, we launched the latest IQOS device ILUMA i in direct channels, with national expansion ongoing. We remain laser focused on innovation. Our innovation in consumables has included a number of new variants and taste experiences on the premium TEREA brand. As shown by the offtake data on this chart, this has helped TEREA to continue growing Japan share at the same time as mainstream-priced SENTIA. This successful strategy of broadening consumer appeal with different price tiers while reinforcing and growing the premium line-up is a good illustration of how our IQOS business is evolving across markets as the category continues to grow. The potential of the category is clearly demonstrated by the performance in Tokyo. As shared at CAGNY, heat-not-burn category volumes surpassed combustibles in January and have continued to grow since then. Led by Japan and Korea, the East Asia & Australia region reached almost two-thirds smoke-free net revenues in Q1. While somewhat flattered by shipment timing, this clearly demonstrates the path forward for the broader company as we strive towards our ambition of becoming substantially smoke-free, surpassing two-thirds by 2030. Outside of Japan and Europe, we continue to see very promising IQOS growth across the globe, including low and middle-income markets, as highlighted by key city offtake shares. A notable call-out is Indonesia, where we have expanded commercialization to targeted areas in new cities and introduced TEREA clove variants catering to kretek taste preferences. We have witnessed an uplift in user growth, and now have over 150,000 estimated IQOS users in the country. Our city offtake share in Urban Jakarta is one indicator of this, with plus 1.6 percentage point growth to 3.4% in a growing total industry. We are also pleased to report the reacceleration of IQOS growth in South Korea following the introduction of ILUMA. TEREA recently became the number one HTU brand as measured by national c-store offtake, and in Seoul IQOS market share grew by 1.8 points to 12.8%. Egypt continues to stand out with Cairo offtake share up 1.3 points to 9.1% despite recent pricing, and we also see promising results in Malaysia, Morocco, Lebanon and the Balkans. While not shown on this slide, Saudi Arabia also had a promising restart with Q1 national offtake share of 1.3% following the resumption of IQOS commercialization in late 2023. In a similar vein to some of our European markets, the November launch of ILUMA in Canada has coincided with an acceleration in key city growth, as shown here by Toronto. While still early days for ILUMA and in a very restrictive regulatory environment, this is clearly a positive development. Moving now to ZYN, where excellent U.S progress continued in Q1 with 70% sequential growth in 12-month rolling shipments. Impressively, category volume share grew for the fourth consecutive quarter to 74.3%, an increase of plus 6.9 points year-on-year and 1.3 points sequentially despite a $0.15 cent per can price increase in March. Retail value share also grew to 79.3%, highlighting ZYN's premium positioning and superior brand equity. This accelerated growth again reflects a broad step-up in nationwide store velocities and gradual distribution expansion as the category gains strong traction with adult nicotine users. As outlined at CAGNY, we remain focused on marketing ZYN responsibly to prevent unintended use. We support the FDA's efforts to ensure only consumers over 21 have access to nicotine products. Swedish Match follows a robust U.S. marketing code that prohibits using social media influencers, age-gates digital platforms to 21-plus and includes partnering with WeCard to help ensure retail sales only to legal-age adults. I'd like to spend a moment now on combustibles, where our portfolio delivered robust organic net revenue growth of plus 3.7% in Q1. This primarily reflects better-than-expected pricing of plus 7.9%, with a notable contribution from Germany, and stepped-up pricing in Egypt. The pricing environment remains favorable, and we now forecast a full-year increase of 6% to 7%, with annualization effects lessening in H2. Our cigarette category share grew by plus 0.3 points in Q1. This includes positive contributions from Algeria, Poland, and Turkey, resulting in only a modest volume decline in a total cigarette industry which fell by 0.6%. Our global brands gained category share during the quarter, with Marlboro gaining plus 0.4 points. As previously flagged, our 2023 share of segment was flattered by competitor supply constraints in Egypt which may normalize this year. As I already mentioned, strong pricing in Q1 coupled with accelerated manufacturing productivities also resulted in a better-than-expected margin evolution. Now, let me provide an update on our latest innovation and expansion plans as we further accelerate our smoke-free transformation. As I covered earlier, we recently launched IQOS ILUMA i, our most innovative offering to-date, in Japan. The ILUMA i portfolio consists of three devices offering a range of adaptable new features. This includes the new touch screen on the device's holder which allows users to see experience-relevant information quickly and easily, as well as a pause mode so users can pause and resume their smoke-free moment where they left off. Initial consumer feedback has been very positive. Japan was the first market to launch ILUMA in H2, 2021 and we plan to gradually roll-out ILUMA i to more geographies over time. As shown in our Japan and Indonesia performance, consumable innovation on the ILUMA platform is also critical, as we broaden offerings across markets. LEVIA HTUs, which contain nicotine but no tobacco leaf, were launched nationwide in the Czech Republic and Romania in Q1 with promising initial results. More markets are planned later this year. DELIA, our new mainstream-price brand for HTUs, was rolled out in Switzerland, Hungary, and Lithuania. In the U.S., we continue to prepare for the first consumer pilots in select cities with the IQOS 3 system. As mentioned previously, the commercialization will be initially limited in scope and will be focused on direct activation of select legal-age nicotine users in a few cities, allowing us to experiment with different elements of the commercial model. The main purpose of these consumer activations is to fine-tune our approach in anticipation of the at-scale launch of IQOS ILUMA, following authorization from the FDA. The international expansion of nicotine pouches remains a key focus, notably for ZYN as the world's leading brand. We have launched or relaunched in 11 markets so far, with more planned later this year. In e-vapor, our focused strategy for VEEV is showing very good early results. Positive consumer feedback is translating into promising repeat-purchase and conversion rates, and we are on a path to profitability in H2. This brings me to our outlook for 2024. With unparalleled smoke-free volume momentum, best-in-class pricing and expanding margins we are raising our full year currency-neutral growth forecasts. This strong pricing, combined with positive smoke- free mix and efficient cost allocation also helps us to mitigate currency headwinds and should allow us, at prevailing rates, to deliver on our objective of robust growth in dollar terms. Given continued ZYN volume progress, we are increasing our U.S. shipment forecast to around 560 million cans. We have further accelerated our capacity expansion plans to support this additional step-up. We continue to target strong growth in both adjusted IMS and shipments of IQOS HTUs, and to reach close to $15 billion in 2024 smoke-free net revenues at prevailing exchange rates. Factoring the increased ZYN shipment forecast and a strong pricing outlook on both combustibles and smoke-free products, we are increasing our organic net revenue growth forecast to plus 7% to plus 8.5%. In addition to higher revenue growth, we expect accelerated organic margin expansion. This is strongly driven by a significant expected uplift in our smoke-free gross margin due to IQOS scale effects, ZYN mix and accelerated manufacturing productivities. It also includes organic gross margin expansion in combustibles, where we had previously assumed a negative development. In addition, we are focused on delivering further SG&A efficiencies while continuing to invest in smoke-free growth. As a result, we are raising our organic operating income growth forecast to plus 10% to plus 12%. Accordingly, we are raising our forecast currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth to plus 9% to plus 11%. This translates into an adjusted diluted EPS range of $6.19 to $6.31, including an unfavorable currency impact of $0.36, at prevailing rates. The increased forecast headwind is primarily explained by the devaluation of the Egyptian pound and recent weakness in the Japanese Yen. As I mentioned, we are taking pro-active actions to mitigate the incremental impact. We expect full-year gross and OI margin expansion, in both organic and dollar terms, at prevailing exchange rates. This includes organic expansion in both H1 and H2. After the excellent Q1 performance, we expect a strong H1 overall with organic net revenue and OI growth around the high end of our full year ranges. For Q2 specifically, we assume HTU shipment volumes of 34 billion to 35 billion and continued strong volume growth from ZYN. We forecast currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS of $1.50 to $1.55, including an unfavorable currency variance of $0.14, at prevailing rates. With regard to our balance sheet, deleveraging remains a key priority. We continue to target a 0.3x to 0.5x improvement in our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio in 2024, driven by profit growth and strong cash flow generation. We also continue to target reaching around 2x by the end of 2026 and will consider buybacks once confirmed we are on-track. Now switching gear. As this quarter coincides with the publication of our 2023 Integrated Report, I would like to welcome Jennifer Motles, PMI Chief Sustainability Officer, to share an update on our sustainability progress. Jennifer, over to you.\nJennifer Motles: Thank you, Emmanuel. I'm very pleased to be joining today's earnings call. As Emmanuel mentioned, our sustainability transformation and business strategies are one and the same. We're focused on creating value for the long term, where generating shareholder returns requires us to deliver on transformation, and delivering on transformation requires us to deliver on sustainability. As shown in our recent results, our product transformation fosters profitable growth and short, medium, and long-term value creation. However, our transformation also means reshaping both our value chain and how we engage with society. As we venture into new product categories, we actively collaborate with different stakeholders and advocate for regulatory frameworks that can accelerate industry change and end smoking. Business transformation is a company-specific journey, which sustainability reporting standards and frameworks often fail to adequately capture. To help illustrate our progress towards achieving our smoke-free purpose, we regularly report our business transformation metrics, a bespoke set of financial and non-financial KPIs. Some of them were already presented by Emmanuel in our financial results. Others you can see here. For example, the growing proportion of commercial and R&D spend on smoke-free products demonstrates the allocation of resources away from our legacy business and towards replacing cigarettes with better alternatives. As another example, increasing the availability and access of adult smokers around the world to smoke-free products are two key pillars of achieving this replacement. As our geographic expansion continues, low-and middle-income markets now make up 47% of our market presence. These metrics, together with our overall performance for 2023, can be found in our latest integrated report published last month and available on our website. It is a comprehensive document covering our most important sustainability topics, starting with our products. The report highlights progress on our continued expansion of smoke-free alternatives across categories and geographies, as well as social and environmental programs deployed with and in parallel to these products in support of sustainable value creation. This includes responsible marketing and sales practices, youth access prevention programs, and efforts to reduce post-consumer waste. Further, it highlights our progress on improving the quality of life of people in our supply chain, decarbonizing our operations and value chain, and preserving nature. We're also very pleased with the continued recognition of our sustainability performance and our robust reporting. To highlight just a few from 2023, PMI was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the first time and for the fourth year in the DJSI North America. In addition, PMI was the only U.S. company to obtain a AAA rating from CDP. More than 20,000 companies worldwide participated in this rating, and only 10 obtained this prestigious recognition. Notably, for investors in parts of Europe, but also in ESG or sustainability-themed funds in the U.S., we're subject to sector exclusion policies because we're a tobacco company. It is clear that excluding companies or sectors from the consideration set does nothing to address the underlying reasons for the exclusion, which in our case would be the harm linked to combustible tobacco use. Many funds that may be excluding tobacco on ESG considerations will still own stocks in other consumer sectors, despite many of these companies not having comparable harm reduction strategies in place to address the impact of their products. As we transform our company away from combustible and work to end smoking at a societal level, we welcome the engagement and challenge of investors to help us accelerate this critical shift. Thank you. I'll now turn it back to Emmanuel.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Jennifer. I will conclude today's presentation with some key messages. Our excellent IQOS and ZYN volume momentum, best-in-class pricing, positive category mix and stepped-up cost efficiencies put us on track for a strong 2024, with accelerated top-line growth and margin expansion. Following an exceptional and better-than-expected start to the year, we have raised our full year currency-neutral growth forecasts. Critically, we are also focused on delivering performance in dollars. We are taking measures to mitigate currency headwinds through pricing, accelerated manufacturing productivities and judicious resource allocation to prioritize growth investments. Our 2024 outlook places us firmly on track to deliver our 2024-2026 CAGR targets. Beyond 2026, we have further exciting opportunities to grow our smoke-free business as we progress towards our ambition of being substantially smoke-free by 2030. Finally and importantly, our strong growth outlook and highly cash generative business underpins our ability to deleverage while maintaining a steadfast commitment to our progressive dividend policy. We look forward to further rewarding our shareholders as our transformation delivers sustainable growth. Thank you and we are now very happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Smith with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nMatt Smith: If we start, the first quarter, it was a strong start to the year. You noted a better revenue and margin performance supporting your ability to raise the outlook for both organic revenue and constant currency EPS. From a high level on a constant currency basis, the first quarter EPS was about $0.20 ahead of your 1Q guidance, and you raised the full year outlook somewhat below that. Can you talk about unique benefits in the first quarter that may have changed the timing through the year? Or how are you viewing the rest of the year different now in terms of the fundamental environment or investment level?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Sure, Matt. I'm happy to explain why some of the bits, but only part of it, of course, because we started, as I explained in my prepared remark, the year in a very strong manner, in an underlying manner. But in addition to the very strong momentum that we are experiencing, indeed, there was around an additional 1 billion HTU stick because of Red Sea. So that has been a plus in Q1, and we expect that to reverse later in the year for the time being. So that's one element that is important. We may have been helped a bit by some volumes on combustible, but it's probably more marginal. And at the scale of the combustible business, it's probably smaller. And then the other element, of course, is the SG&A evolution, organically 1.4% increase only. We want to grow organically revenue faster than SG&A, but of course, we will have the 10 points of difference that we've been experiencing in Q1. So that will also reverse partially in the rest of the year as we are coming with some phasing on commercial actions and marketing, advertising later in the year and starting in Q2, where we will have more SG&A. So I think that with that, you have the key element that has been adding to what was, as I said, very strong momentum anyway in Q1.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nBonnie Herzog: Emmanuel, I wanted to maybe ask for a little bit of more color on a point you made about or at the end of your script regarding currency headwinds and how you're hoping to mitigate these headwinds. You highlighted pricing and productivity savings, et cetera. So maybe just provide a little bit more color on those, I guess, levers if you can pull them and maybe why you're more optimistic going forward, given the never-ending currency headwinds since it continues to impact your business. I think that would be helpful.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Sure, Bonnie. Happy to share our view and what we're doing on that one. So we said it at the beginning of the year and then we're at CAGNY, we want to deliver performance in dollar terms. And therefore, that means that even when we have another significant ForEx headwind and, you know, some of that, I mean, we have in Q1 actually $0.06 coming from the Egyptian pound that won't be there next year. So that's not something that's going to stay with us. So it's a kind of one-off negative impact. But we want to deliver robust growth in dollar terms. So in order to deliver that, we have two big levers, I would say. One is on price. And to be clear, when we talk about price, it's, of course, in the countries where we can see some devaluation, but not only. It's really across the board. How can we push the boundaries and push, to the maximum of the limit, the price increase? Well, we think that we're doing in a way that is not necessarily taking a big risk on market share. But we are clearly here and notably on combustible pushing on price increase. So that's something that we can do. That is taking into account a certain economic environment. And in the current environment, we are doing what we think is optimized and the best we can. Of course, if there was some more depreciation, more devaluation, we would reconsider whether more action can be done. And then on productivity and on cost efficiency, that means really accelerating everything we can do on productivity. And we are working across the board. It's, of course, on procurement. It's on optimizing the manufacturing footprints. It's on logistic. I mean, it's on everything where we can generate extra saving and playing with this environment of a strong dollar. And then on cost allocation. I mean, of course, we are working permanently as part of our 2 billion saving program on plans to be simpler, to generate efficiency, to work in a more efficient manner. So we do that. We try to accelerate that. Here again, we're trying to do things faster. And we are also making sure that when it comes to investment allocation, we really prioritize on what is having the biggest and strongest and I would say clearest return, which is allowing us to also generate some profitability improvement to partially offset the negative ForEx. So that's really everything that all the action that we are doing. We're not saying we can offset any kind, of course, of ForEx environment. But I think our Q1 numbers and the outlook for the year is showing that we have some good capacity to mitigate to a very significant extent the ForEx impact.\nBonnie Herzog: Okay. That is helpful. And then I just had a quick question, if I may, on ZYN. We're actually hearing about some out of stocks in the U.S. from some of our industry trade contacts. So, maybe hoping for a little more color on this and how much it might have impacted volumes in the quarter. Also, curious if these issues are related to maybe specific production issues or more related to the strong demand and ultimately when you expect them to be resolved. Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Bonnie. This is very much the latter. I mean, you can imagine when a business is growing 80% and we are growing 80%. That is indeed creating some tensions on the supply chain without any doubt. I'm not sure that out of stock is still the proper word, given where we are today. I think that, maybe sometime a reference is not going to be available. Not everything is going to be is going to be is going to be fully available in the range at a certain point in time. But look at what, the Nielsen are telling us on Q1 and our volume. I mean, we seem to be growing fast and it's difficult to see any kind of impact coming from restriction on availability. As we said, we are working very hard to maximize our capacity in this fast-growing environment for ZYN. We are comfortable, of course, with our capacity to deliver around our 560 million can. That is not the limit that we are putting, of course, in terms of production capacity. But we are in this phase of adaptation to this strong growth and fast-raising demand. I think so far, maybe with some tension, but with limited impact on volumes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Owen Bennett with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nOwen Bennett: First question on heated. Can you maybe talk a bit more about the contribution from newer markets? Is this trending in line with expectations or do you see potential for upside here? Because some of the trends you called out sound very encouraging. I'd also love an update on bonds in the latest with this, if possible. Thank you.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Yes, with pleasure, Owen. So I think we see and you said it, I've been elaborating on the number of markets where we see very interesting trajectory for new market. We've been speaking about Indonesia. We could have been speaking in addition to all the markets I've been covering. I could have been speaking about Mexico, where we have also a nice acceleration and we are just launching ILUMA. So the good thing is that we're not relying on one or two names, but we start to have a growing team of new markets where we see clearly, IQOS getting traction and increasing its stake. First, as always, in the big cities. That's where in many of these countries we have the biggest potential. But that's, I would say, happening in line with expectation. And as I said, we expect even a further acceleration in the second part of the year. We believe that then Taiwan will also start adding to the flow of this new market. So it's in line with expectation and clearly coming with a great potential. And as always, IQOS being perceived as, in many big cities rapidly as an aspirational product, which is extremely positive for the future and the brand franchise that we're going to be able to build there. Then on top of this new market and the IQOS trajectory in this new market, we have indeed bonds that we plan to develop in the future. We've been making the test, as we explained, in the Philippines and Colombia. We are working on the result. We are making a number of adjustments and will come with a detailed plan in the coming quarters. To make sure that we come with a product that has all the ingredients, all the features to be a great success. And we're working on it. That's going to be really important in all this market, because we know that the affordability here is different. To come with a portfolio that is segmented and where IQOS will have a role to play. But we need to also come with the rest of the portfolio bonds in order to cover this market.\nOwen Bennett: Thank you. Very helpful. And I just add one more. I want to talk a bit more about Vape. And what sort of volumes do you think you can do here for the year? And if I heard you right, you said you'll be profitable already in H2, which would suggest volumes have been really healthy already. And just any kind of commentary on which markets you're seeing the strongest traction so far?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Sure, Owen. Of course, there is modest versus IQOS and ZYN in terms of impact at the group level. And we stick to our strategy, which is we don't want to be big in vaping if it's to lose money. We want to be really going with VEEV in markets where we are having the right commercial impact where VEEV can make a difference and in a profitable manner. Indeed, the year started well in terms of volumes. We have this outlook of moving into positive bottom line for VEEV in the second part of the year, which would be very good news. And we are prioritizing markets where we have the critical mass, where I would say the nature of the vaping market is interesting. And we are developing today very nicely, I would say, in markets such as Italy, Czech Republic, France, UK, developing in Canada. These are markets where we can reach, if you want, the size, the mass and where we have the impact to make our vaping business successful and profitable.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Faham Baig with UBS. Your line is open.\nFaham Baig: I have a couple as well, both on heated tobacco. Firstly, could I get your view on any implications that you see from the recent EU court ruling on the supplementary excise tax in Germany to any other of the European countries? And when are you expecting a decision from the finance court in Dusseldorf? And the second question, please, is again on heated tobacco. Clearly, pricing has stepped up over the last couple of quarters. How are you thinking about balance between price and volume growth? And could pricing be higher than the original guidance of low single digits?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you for the question. So, first of all, on the German situation, I mean, yes, they've been asking for the view from the European Court of Justice. But it's a purely German question whether the way they've been implementing their extra tax was according to EU law or not. So there is no consequences for other countries. It's really a German question due to how they implemented this increase in the tax. So that's what it is. On the final decision, because as of today, that would be the decision from the German court. I have to say, I don't know when we will know more, I guess in the coming months, obviously. But I'm not going to be able to be more specific on the timing of the Dusseldorf court to make the decision. There are a number of steps still needs to be taken before they get there. So that will be for the coming months. But given where we are today, I'm not able to tell you when they will make the decision. Regarding your second question on price versus volume. So we said, and I'm going to stick to that. Yes, we believe that we can increase price more low single digits or not at the level of combustible on is not burn. Again, I think we are very clear on the very positive impact coming from the growth in volume from heat-not-burn our business. They're coming with a much higher per stick revenue. They're coming now with a higher gross margin rate, even at the level of just the consumable. It's significantly higher than for combustible as an average for the group. So that means that's really growing volumes is the name of the game for us. That's where it makes sense. Now, on top of it, given the very strong franchise of IQOS and the attractiveness of the brand, we are able to increase price without putting in danger the volume. But that's really the way you should be looking at it for us today. It's very much a play on maximizing the volumes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gaurav Jain with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nGaurav Jain: So two questions from me. So one is, just conceptually. So, let's take a city like Tokyo where the heated tobacco category share is now 50% plus. So one can argue that by increasing the premium cigarette prices, which haven't increased now in two years, you can accelerate the down trading to IQOS. This will accelerate IQOS volume growth. This will also accelerate your dollar EPS growth out of Japan. So why wouldn't you do something like this in cities and countries where heated tobacco and IQOS becomes the dominant form factor?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you for your question, Gaurav. Look, I'm always very cautious, of course, as you can imagine, on commenting any kind of price strategy. So don't expect me to enter into any kind of detail. But conceptually, it is clear that as we build leadership in the category, as there is a growing adhesion from the nicotine user to heat-not-burn, there is a capacity for ongoing premiumization and more price increase without any doubt. But as I said, and as I explained, with the previous question, we believe that today still it's very much about maximizing the volumes. And that's what for us is important, of course, coming with great gross profit per stick and great contribution. So I'm certainly not closing the door to more price in the future. But I think I've been clear on what our priorities are. Having said that, as you know, in Japan, we need to have an agreement from the authority to increase the price. So I think it's something that is also sometimes regulated. So it doesn't mean that we have all the latitude that we would like to enjoy on the topic. So that's on the long-term. It is clear that today, as we've been discussing that already, you have the IQOS consumable that are positioned, even at some discount versus Marlboro. That gives an idea of the kind of increase that we'll be able to reach in the future, probably without too much, I would say, issues over time. Once again, it doesn't happen in one go. But as I explained for the time being, maximizing volume is the name of the game. And it's coming with, I think, what the Q1 is illustrating in a very bright manner, a very, very powerful mixed impact on our financial performance.\nGaurav Jain: Sure. And my second question is on Russia. So, IQOS volumes in Russia grew, which is surprising, given that you do not invest in IQOS there anymore. So how should we -- so first of all, can you just remind us the contribution of Russia on your EPS? And how should we think of Russia IQOS shipments for this year?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Look, on Russia, you have to be a bit cautious on the shipment that you see. And that does not necessarily fully reflect the consumer offtake. You can have some movement from the surrounding countries. So I think we have to be cautious. So Russia is a market that has not been -- if I look at the past, I'm not sure that one quarter is enabling us to conclude anything. Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Russia has been a market that has not shown, unfortunately, any kind of meaningful growth. Today, we have no reason to believe that suddenly Russia is going to become a growth market, because nothing has changed fundamentally. And that's a country that has been impacted, of course, by currency depreciation that has been impacting the weight in the EPS. So I think that we were referring to 7% to 8%. I think we'll have to revise. And I don't have the number top of mind for 24 on the outlook, but that was the kind -- it was around 9, 10. And I think with the currency, it has been losing a bit of weight in the overall performance of the company.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Callum Elliott with Barclays (sic) [Bernstein]. Your line is now open.\nCallum Elliott: So my question is actually following up on Bonnie's question on dollar growth. In 2013, I think your dollar EPS, Emmanuel, was $5.40 per share. So you've compounded dollar EPS growth at about 1.5% percent over the subsequent 10, 11 years. So best-in-class organic growth and probably worst-in-class dollar EPS growth over that 10-year period, which is really striking given that 10 years captures the whole of the creation of this IQOS business that has been quite remarkable. So my question is, you obviously outlined a number of initiatives in answer to Bonnie's question of how you hope to drive dollar growth. But maybe you could sort of double back on those explanations. Which of those are actually new and haven't been present over that sort of past 10-year period that could have been helping you over that past 10 years? Because it struck me in those explanations that it sounded like things like pricing, et cetera. Those have all been around for the past 10 years and haven't helped you offset the FX. So is there anything you can tell us that's new that should give investors confidence that if FX headwinds persist, you are able to drive dollar growth for your business?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you for your question. Well, first of all, I guess you are assuming that the ForEx headwind will persist in the coming years, which I think nobody can really say. We know that currency can be facing cycles and that it's true that the last 10 years have been about a strengthening of the dollar. We've been knowing other cycles where the dollar was more weakening versus at least other hard currency. So nobody knows what's going to happen. I think what we are saying and thank you for giving me the opportunity to maybe repeat and clarify that we are today in a position to put together very strong growth before ForEx. And I think you are seeing with the guidance for '24 that we are obviously coming still with a very dynamic top line, very much accelerating operating income growth. We are targeting a double-digit before currency impact now in 2024. And on top of that, we are going to price and in an environment that today we see positive for pricing, certainly with the fact that pricing on combustible is something that we can use now very tactically. We know that CC is not our future, so we can certainly use pricing very tactically in order to boost performance. We also are coming with some price increase at the level of HTU. We have some price increase on ZYN as well. So we have globally a pricing environment that looks attractive to us in the future. And then, when it comes to our cost, it is true that we've been investing a lot in the past years, and we've been reporting on all the action that we were having on investment across the board, in terms of innovation, in terms of science, in terms of R&D, in terms of manufacturing. Now is the time where, of course, we are reaching critical mass on smoke-free products. There are a number of things that we are doing that we can do more efficiently, a number of things that we've been learning and that we're going to implement in the continuation of our journey. So all that we believe is also giving us some very good ammunition and capacity to generate efficiency at a very high level in the future. So that's all the -- and they are quite important, quite numerous, all the levers that we own to deliver performance in dollar terms in the future.\nCallum Elliott: Thanks Emmanuel, that's helpful. Maybe I can just ask a follow-up. So we have a number of U.S. consumer staples companies reporting this morning, and many of them face similar FX headwinds, sort of incremental FX headwinds over the past two, three months, as PMI does. And it's striking to me that amongst some of those companies, even a commoditized U.S. toilet paper company has done a better job this quarter of offsetting these incremental emerging market FX headwinds with sort of rapidly responding with incremental price increases to offset those headwinds. So I guess my question here is, you know, is there something structural in your business that's making it less agile in responding to these changes in FX relative to some of your other consumer staples peers outside of the tobacco space?\nEmmanuel Babeau: Well, can I answer you that your question is highly speculative because you asked me to compare with other businesses that are obviously very different in, I guess, the way they invest, their outlook, what they have to do. We are building here a business that has a tremendous growth potential, so we're not going to, of course, limit all the initiative, all the investment that we must do in order to keep growing the business and extract the full potential that we have with our smoke-free portfolio. Maybe that's different versus the paper business you were mentioning. I frankly have no clue because I don't know what you are referring to and the specific situation. But I think it's difficult to probably compare businesses that are facing different potential, different trajectories. That would be my answer.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back to management for closing remarks.\nJames Bushnell: Thank you for joining us. That concludes our call today. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations team. Thank you again and have a nice day.\nEmmanuel Babeau: Bye-bye. Speak to you soon.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Emmanuel Babeau",
            "content": "Thank you, James, and welcome, everyone. In Q1, we delivered outstanding performance that exceeded our expectations with double-digit growth in organic net revenue and operating income, as well as currency-neutral adjusted diluted earnings per share, all supported by robust volume growth. Excellent smoke- free business momentum continues with plus 25% organic growth in net revenues and plus 38% in gross profit, as IQOS operating leverage and ZYN mix contribute positively. IQOS continues to advance rapidly, with growth of 13% in adjusted in market sales volumes and plus 21% in shipments. IQOS ILUMA is a key driver of this progress and is now available in 64 markets, representing nearly 100% of IQOS volumes outside Russia. ZYN also continued its considerable growth in Q1, with U.S. volumes up plus 80%. Importantly, this top-line performance translated into strong operating income growth and margin expansion, both organically and in dollar terms. This was notably driven by accelerating profitability in both our IQOS and ZYN businesses, in addition to improving combustible performance. We faced higher-than-expected currency headwinds in the quarter, primarily due to the devaluation of the Egyptian pound. We are taking mitigating actions including additional pricing and accelerated cost initiatives, which allowed us to deliver Q1 adjusted diluted EPS above our prior expectation, despite these pressures. While the prior year quarter was favorable for certain growth comparisons, this exceptional start to the year sets the stage for us to deliver significantly better-than- expected 2024 currency-neutral growth, and robust growth in U.S. dollar at prevailing rates. Turning to the headline numbers, very good shipment volume growth of plus 3.6% supported organic top-line growth of plus 11.0%, or plus 8.6% including currency. This reflects continued excellent IQOS and ZYN momentum as well as strong combustible pricing. Operating income grew by plus 22.2% organically versus a softer prior-year quarter, notably driven by gross margin expansion and a deceleration in SG&A growth. As a result, our organic OI margins expanded by plus 3.7 percentage points. In dollar terms, adjusted OI grew by plus 11.3% and adjusted OI margins expanded by 90 basis points. We outperformed our Q1 adjusted EPS outlook due to three main factors. The first is the net revenue and profit impact of better volumes following the industry-leading performance of ZYN, the strong shipment growth of IQOS HTUs including some higher-than-expected timing benefits, and a resilient combustible delivery. Second is the benefit of our pricing actions to mitigate currency headwinds and third is on cost including some timing benefit and a stepped-up focus on manufacturing and back office efficiencies to prioritize growth investments. The majority of the outperformance was driven by underlying business dynamics, which bodes well for the remainder of the year. Indeed, we delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.50, representing plus 23.2% growth excluding an unfavorable currency impact of $0.20. This includes $0.09 from the devaluation of the Egyptian pound, including a transactional impact of $0.06 primarily related to the balance sheet remeasurement of foreign currency payables. With increased liquidity in the Egyptian pounds, we are now reducing our balance sheet exposure, and this should be complete in the coming weeks. Focusing now on volumes, our Q1 HTU shipments of 33.1 billion units exceeded our outlook, with robust underlying growth across geographies and a higher-than- anticipated timing impact of shipments to Japan. The incremental phasing impact was around 1 billion units and was primarily related to Red Sea disruption. While uncertain, we assume this will normalize in the second half of the year. As mentioned previously, we believe the best indicator of underlying HTU growth is adjusted in market sales, as the closest metric to consumer offtake. Adjusted IMS volume grew nicely by plus 12.5%, including the expected impact from the characterizing flavor ban in Europe. We continue to see strong IQOS momentum, with excellent growth in Japan, robust underlying fundamentals in Europe, and a growing contribution from newer markets such as Indonesia. We continue to target plus 14% to plus 16% adjusted IMS growth for the year, with around plus 10% growth in Q2 followed by an H2 acceleration driven by the timing of commercial programs, ILUMA uptake, newer markets and a less demanding prior year comparison. Total smoke-free volume growth of plus 22% includes the impressive expansion of our oral smoke-free portfolio powered by ZYN, with pouch equivalent shipment volumes up by plus 35.8%. U.S. ZYN shipments grew by plus 80% to 132 million cans. Cigarette shipments declined by a modest 0.4% in the first quarter, with a notable positive contribution from Turkey as we increased share in a strong overall market. Let me now walk through the drivers of our Q1 net revenues. As I mentioned, volumes grew by a remarkable 3.6%, including oral. Pricing contributed plus 5.5 points of growth primarily from combustibles, as well as pricing of around plus 3% on HTUs. Smoke-free category mix added plus 3.1 percentage points to the top-line, reflecting the higher net revenue per unit of IQOS and, to an even greater extent, ZYN. Oral smoke-free product overall boosted our organic net revenue growth by plus 2.2 points, showcasing its role as a meaningful accelerator. To report a positive contribution from our VEEV e-vapor business which, while still small in the context of the group, delivered good revenue growth. As in 2023, there was a negative geographic mix within our combustible business as lower margin markets, often without smoke-free products, grew faster; and smoke-free products accelerated cigarette declines elsewhere. The positive category mix impact of smoke-free products, overall volume growth, and pricing are the three enduring engines of our transformation and growth. Focusing now on the key dynamics of our Q1 profit delivery, smoke-free gross profit grew by an impressive plus 38% organically, on top-line growth of 25%. This reflects the very strong performance of U.S. ZYN and the growth and scale effects of IQOS, including manufacturing productivities. This strong underlying acceleration was amplified by only a few percentage points due to HTU shipment phasing. Gross margins expanded substantially for both heat-not-burn and oral nicotine, and by a striking plus 600 basis points organically for smoke-free overall, which made up close to 39% of total gross profit, an increase of plus 6 percentage points versus prior year. Combustible organic gross profit growth was notably improved and exceeded our expectation at plus 2.3%. Gross margins were also better-than-anticipated, leading to an improved full year outlook. Resilient volumes, strong pricing and manufacturing productivities more than offset the continued cost pressures in the category, geographic mix, and the impact of IQOS cannibalization. As previously flagged, cost increases in leaf, wages and certain other inputs carried over into 2024, and these should ease next year. We were also impacted by around $30 million of costs from implementation of the EU Single-Use Plastics Directive, primarily on cigarettes. A key feature of Q1 was strong operating income margin expansion. Gross margins increased organically by 150 basis points and by 80 basis points including currency. This reflects excellent expansion within smoke-free products, their growing weight within our business at higher margins, and the better-than-expected evolution of combustibles. These factors, combined with productivity savings, significantly outweighed the unfavorable technical dilutive impact of third-party manufacturing in Indonesia, which equated to 30 basis points in the quarter. For SG&A costs, currency-neutral growth of only plus 1.4% drove 220 basis points of organic margin expansion. This benefitted from our resource allocation and prioritization programs, including the delivery of approximately $160 million in gross cost efficiencies across COGS and SG&A towards our $2 billion target for 2024-2026. Although the Q1 margin impact of SG&A cost evolution including currency was small due notably to Egyptian Pound transactional currency, we continue to target SG&A progression below top-line growth for the year. We expect higher organic SG&A increases in the remainder of 2024, notably reflecting investment spend phasing, which was favorable in Q1. The combination of these factors powered a remarkable plus 370 basis point expansion in our organic operating income margins, and plus 90 basis points including currency. This exceeded our expectation and we are now raising our full-year operating income growth outlook, as I will come back to. Taking another lens on adjusted operating income margins by geography, we see broad-based global momentum with all regions delivering strong organic progress. In dollar terms, margins expanded in every region except the South and Southeast Asia, CIS, and Middle East Africa region, mainly reflecting the transactional currency impact of the Egyptian pound and the technical dilution in Indonesia. Indeed, excluding these factors, this region grew margins at a very similar rate to the group. Moving to IQOS. With ILUMA now widely launched, PMI HTUs continue to strengthen their position as the second largest nicotine 'brand' in markets where IQOS is present. PMI HTUs now exceed the 10% market share milestone on the prior basis excluding Indonesia, which we now include following broader commercialization in the market. Our HTUs are the number on nicotine 'brand' in 11 markets, and as shown at CAGNY, IQOS net revenues have surpassed those of Marlboro. Focusing on IQOS in Europe, Q1 HTU share increased by plus 0.9 points, also crossing the 10% regional share milestone for the first time. While still early in many markets, the growing availability and uptake of ILUMA is a key driver and we are seeing a strong acceleration in a number of historically slower-growth markets. Adjusted IMS volumes continue to exhibit robust sequential growth and reached a record high of 12.6 billion units on a four-quarter moving average. This reflects year-on-year progression of plus 9.4% in Q1, with excellent growth in Greece, Portugal, Germany, Spain, UK and the Netherlands. Growth was slower in certain Central European markets such as Poland and Czech Republic, where increased economic pressures and price-sensitivity are visible. We continue to evolve our portfolio in these markets under the recently-launched ILUMA system to drive further growth. Excluding Ukraine, where growth was absent, adjusted in market sales grew double-digit. As anticipated, the 11 markets so far affected by EU characterizing flavor restrictions saw an impact in line with our total region estimate of around 2 billion sticks for the year. Consistent with similar past situations, we observe an initial consumer adjustment followed by a reversion of growth rates to previous levels. We have not seen meaningful shifts towards e-vapor or competitor heat-not-burn products, and we expect the structural growth of IQOS to fuel continued HTU progression over the rest of the year. The strong fundamental progress in the region is highlighted by the expansion in key city offtake shares. Very strong gains in cities with already high IQOS adoption, such as Lisbon, Rome, Athens and Budapest, demonstrate the potential for further growth at the national level. The recent acceleration in London, Madrid, Munich and Amsterdam is also very promising for the IQOS brand in these markets and for Europe overall. In Japan, the adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by an excellent plus 3.1 points to 29.3%. Adjusted IMS volumes increased by plus 13%, maintaining the rapid progress of recent quarters. Such impressive growth in a market with already-high category penetration is a clear testament to the sustainable growth potential of IQOS around the world. In connection with IQOS' strong brand equity and commercial footprint, we are fostering growth through continued innovation on both devices and consumables. In March, we launched the latest IQOS device ILUMA i in direct channels, with national expansion ongoing. We remain laser focused on innovation. Our innovation in consumables has included a number of new variants and taste experiences on the premium TEREA brand. As shown by the offtake data on this chart, this has helped TEREA to continue growing Japan share at the same time as mainstream-priced SENTIA. This successful strategy of broadening consumer appeal with different price tiers while reinforcing and growing the premium line-up is a good illustration of how our IQOS business is evolving across markets as the category continues to grow. The potential of the category is clearly demonstrated by the performance in Tokyo. As shared at CAGNY, heat-not-burn category volumes surpassed combustibles in January and have continued to grow since then. Led by Japan and Korea, the East Asia & Australia region reached almost two-thirds smoke-free net revenues in Q1. While somewhat flattered by shipment timing, this clearly demonstrates the path forward for the broader company as we strive towards our ambition of becoming substantially smoke-free, surpassing two-thirds by 2030. Outside of Japan and Europe, we continue to see very promising IQOS growth across the globe, including low and middle-income markets, as highlighted by key city offtake shares. A notable call-out is Indonesia, where we have expanded commercialization to targeted areas in new cities and introduced TEREA clove variants catering to kretek taste preferences. We have witnessed an uplift in user growth, and now have over 150,000 estimated IQOS users in the country. Our city offtake share in Urban Jakarta is one indicator of this, with plus 1.6 percentage point growth to 3.4% in a growing total industry. We are also pleased to report the reacceleration of IQOS growth in South Korea following the introduction of ILUMA. TEREA recently became the number one HTU brand as measured by national c-store offtake, and in Seoul IQOS market share grew by 1.8 points to 12.8%. Egypt continues to stand out with Cairo offtake share up 1.3 points to 9.1% despite recent pricing, and we also see promising results in Malaysia, Morocco, Lebanon and the Balkans. While not shown on this slide, Saudi Arabia also had a promising restart with Q1 national offtake share of 1.3% following the resumption of IQOS commercialization in late 2023. In a similar vein to some of our European markets, the November launch of ILUMA in Canada has coincided with an acceleration in key city growth, as shown here by Toronto. While still early days for ILUMA and in a very restrictive regulatory environment, this is clearly a positive development. Moving now to ZYN, where excellent U.S progress continued in Q1 with 70% sequential growth in 12-month rolling shipments. Impressively, category volume share grew for the fourth consecutive quarter to 74.3%, an increase of plus 6.9 points year-on-year and 1.3 points sequentially despite a $0.15 cent per can price increase in March. Retail value share also grew to 79.3%, highlighting ZYN's premium positioning and superior brand equity. This accelerated growth again reflects a broad step-up in nationwide store velocities and gradual distribution expansion as the category gains strong traction with adult nicotine users. As outlined at CAGNY, we remain focused on marketing ZYN responsibly to prevent unintended use. We support the FDA's efforts to ensure only consumers over 21 have access to nicotine products. Swedish Match follows a robust U.S. marketing code that prohibits using social media influencers, age-gates digital platforms to 21-plus and includes partnering with WeCard to help ensure retail sales only to legal-age adults. I'd like to spend a moment now on combustibles, where our portfolio delivered robust organic net revenue growth of plus 3.7% in Q1. This primarily reflects better-than-expected pricing of plus 7.9%, with a notable contribution from Germany, and stepped-up pricing in Egypt. The pricing environment remains favorable, and we now forecast a full-year increase of 6% to 7%, with annualization effects lessening in H2. Our cigarette category share grew by plus 0.3 points in Q1. This includes positive contributions from Algeria, Poland, and Turkey, resulting in only a modest volume decline in a total cigarette industry which fell by 0.6%. Our global brands gained category share during the quarter, with Marlboro gaining plus 0.4 points. As previously flagged, our 2023 share of segment was flattered by competitor supply constraints in Egypt which may normalize this year. As I already mentioned, strong pricing in Q1 coupled with accelerated manufacturing productivities also resulted in a better-than-expected margin evolution. Now, let me provide an update on our latest innovation and expansion plans as we further accelerate our smoke-free transformation. As I covered earlier, we recently launched IQOS ILUMA i, our most innovative offering to-date, in Japan. The ILUMA i portfolio consists of three devices offering a range of adaptable new features. This includes the new touch screen on the device's holder which allows users to see experience-relevant information quickly and easily, as well as a pause mode so users can pause and resume their smoke-free moment where they left off. Initial consumer feedback has been very positive. Japan was the first market to launch ILUMA in H2, 2021 and we plan to gradually roll-out ILUMA i to more geographies over time. As shown in our Japan and Indonesia performance, consumable innovation on the ILUMA platform is also critical, as we broaden offerings across markets. LEVIA HTUs, which contain nicotine but no tobacco leaf, were launched nationwide in the Czech Republic and Romania in Q1 with promising initial results. More markets are planned later this year. DELIA, our new mainstream-price brand for HTUs, was rolled out in Switzerland, Hungary, and Lithuania. In the U.S., we continue to prepare for the first consumer pilots in select cities with the IQOS 3 system. As mentioned previously, the commercialization will be initially limited in scope and will be focused on direct activation of select legal-age nicotine users in a few cities, allowing us to experiment with different elements of the commercial model. The main purpose of these consumer activations is to fine-tune our approach in anticipation of the at-scale launch of IQOS ILUMA, following authorization from the FDA. The international expansion of nicotine pouches remains a key focus, notably for ZYN as the world's leading brand. We have launched or relaunched in 11 markets so far, with more planned later this year. In e-vapor, our focused strategy for VEEV is showing very good early results. Positive consumer feedback is translating into promising repeat-purchase and conversion rates, and we are on a path to profitability in H2. This brings me to our outlook for 2024. With unparalleled smoke-free volume momentum, best-in-class pricing and expanding margins we are raising our full year currency-neutral growth forecasts. This strong pricing, combined with positive smoke- free mix and efficient cost allocation also helps us to mitigate currency headwinds and should allow us, at prevailing rates, to deliver on our objective of robust growth in dollar terms. Given continued ZYN volume progress, we are increasing our U.S. shipment forecast to around 560 million cans. We have further accelerated our capacity expansion plans to support this additional step-up. We continue to target strong growth in both adjusted IMS and shipments of IQOS HTUs, and to reach close to $15 billion in 2024 smoke-free net revenues at prevailing exchange rates. Factoring the increased ZYN shipment forecast and a strong pricing outlook on both combustibles and smoke-free products, we are increasing our organic net revenue growth forecast to plus 7% to plus 8.5%. In addition to higher revenue growth, we expect accelerated organic margin expansion. This is strongly driven by a significant expected uplift in our smoke-free gross margin due to IQOS scale effects, ZYN mix and accelerated manufacturing productivities. It also includes organic gross margin expansion in combustibles, where we had previously assumed a negative development. In addition, we are focused on delivering further SG&A efficiencies while continuing to invest in smoke-free growth. As a result, we are raising our organic operating income growth forecast to plus 10% to plus 12%. Accordingly, we are raising our forecast currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth to plus 9% to plus 11%. This translates into an adjusted diluted EPS range of $6.19 to $6.31, including an unfavorable currency impact of $0.36, at prevailing rates. The increased forecast headwind is primarily explained by the devaluation of the Egyptian pound and recent weakness in the Japanese Yen. As I mentioned, we are taking pro-active actions to mitigate the incremental impact. We expect full-year gross and OI margin expansion, in both organic and dollar terms, at prevailing exchange rates. This includes organic expansion in both H1 and H2. After the excellent Q1 performance, we expect a strong H1 overall with organic net revenue and OI growth around the high end of our full year ranges. For Q2 specifically, we assume HTU shipment volumes of 34 billion to 35 billion and continued strong volume growth from ZYN. We forecast currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS of $1.50 to $1.55, including an unfavorable currency variance of $0.14, at prevailing rates. With regard to our balance sheet, deleveraging remains a key priority. We continue to target a 0.3x to 0.5x improvement in our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio in 2024, driven by profit growth and strong cash flow generation. We also continue to target reaching around 2x by the end of 2026 and will consider buybacks once confirmed we are on-track. Now switching gear. As this quarter coincides with the publication of our 2023 Integrated Report, I would like to welcome Jennifer Motles, PMI Chief Sustainability Officer, to share an update on our sustainability progress. Jennifer, over to you. Thank you, Jennifer. I will conclude today's presentation with some key messages. Our excellent IQOS and ZYN volume momentum, best-in-class pricing, positive category mix and stepped-up cost efficiencies put us on track for a strong 2024, with accelerated top-line growth and margin expansion. Following an exceptional and better-than-expected start to the year, we have raised our full year currency-neutral growth forecasts. Critically, we are also focused on delivering performance in dollars. We are taking measures to mitigate currency headwinds through pricing, accelerated manufacturing productivities and judicious resource allocation to prioritize growth investments. Our 2024 outlook places us firmly on track to deliver our 2024-2026 CAGR targets. Beyond 2026, we have further exciting opportunities to grow our smoke-free business as we progress towards our ambition of being substantially smoke-free by 2030. Finally and importantly, our strong growth outlook and highly cash generative business underpins our ability to deleverage while maintaining a steadfast commitment to our progressive dividend policy. We look forward to further rewarding our shareholders as our transformation delivers sustainable growth. Thank you and we are now very happy to answer your questions. Sure, Matt. I'm happy to explain why some of the bits, but only part of it, of course, because we started, as I explained in my prepared remark, the year in a very strong manner, in an underlying manner. But in addition to the very strong momentum that we are experiencing, indeed, there was around an additional 1 billion HTU stick because of Red Sea. So that has been a plus in Q1, and we expect that to reverse later in the year for the time being. So that's one element that is important. We may have been helped a bit by some volumes on combustible, but it's probably more marginal. And at the scale of the combustible business, it's probably smaller. And then the other element, of course, is the SG&A evolution, organically 1.4% increase only. We want to grow organically revenue faster than SG&A, but of course, we will have the 10 points of difference that we've been experiencing in Q1. So that will also reverse partially in the rest of the year as we are coming with some phasing on commercial actions and marketing, advertising later in the year and starting in Q2, where we will have more SG&A. So I think that with that, you have the key element that has been adding to what was, as I said, very strong momentum anyway in Q1. Sure, Bonnie. Happy to share our view and what we're doing on that one. So we said it at the beginning of the year and then we're at CAGNY, we want to deliver performance in dollar terms. And therefore, that means that even when we have another significant ForEx headwind and, you know, some of that, I mean, we have in Q1 actually $0.06 coming from the Egyptian pound that won't be there next year. So that's not something that's going to stay with us. So it's a kind of one-off negative impact. But we want to deliver robust growth in dollar terms. So in order to deliver that, we have two big levers, I would say. One is on price. And to be clear, when we talk about price, it's, of course, in the countries where we can see some devaluation, but not only. It's really across the board. How can we push the boundaries and push, to the maximum of the limit, the price increase? Well, we think that we're doing in a way that is not necessarily taking a big risk on market share. But we are clearly here and notably on combustible pushing on price increase. So that's something that we can do. That is taking into account a certain economic environment. And in the current environment, we are doing what we think is optimized and the best we can. Of course, if there was some more depreciation, more devaluation, we would reconsider whether more action can be done. And then on productivity and on cost efficiency, that means really accelerating everything we can do on productivity. And we are working across the board. It's, of course, on procurement. It's on optimizing the manufacturing footprints. It's on logistic. I mean, it's on everything where we can generate extra saving and playing with this environment of a strong dollar. And then on cost allocation. I mean, of course, we are working permanently as part of our 2 billion saving program on plans to be simpler, to generate efficiency, to work in a more efficient manner. So we do that. We try to accelerate that. Here again, we're trying to do things faster. And we are also making sure that when it comes to investment allocation, we really prioritize on what is having the biggest and strongest and I would say clearest return, which is allowing us to also generate some profitability improvement to partially offset the negative ForEx. So that's really everything that all the action that we are doing. We're not saying we can offset any kind, of course, of ForEx environment. But I think our Q1 numbers and the outlook for the year is showing that we have some good capacity to mitigate to a very significant extent the ForEx impact. Thank you, Bonnie. This is very much the latter. I mean, you can imagine when a business is growing 80% and we are growing 80%. That is indeed creating some tensions on the supply chain without any doubt. I'm not sure that out of stock is still the proper word, given where we are today. I think that, maybe sometime a reference is not going to be available. Not everything is going to be is going to be is going to be fully available in the range at a certain point in time. But look at what, the Nielsen are telling us on Q1 and our volume. I mean, we seem to be growing fast and it's difficult to see any kind of impact coming from restriction on availability. As we said, we are working very hard to maximize our capacity in this fast-growing environment for ZYN. We are comfortable, of course, with our capacity to deliver around our 560 million can. That is not the limit that we are putting, of course, in terms of production capacity. But we are in this phase of adaptation to this strong growth and fast-raising demand. I think so far, maybe with some tension, but with limited impact on volumes. Yes, with pleasure, Owen. So I think we see and you said it, I've been elaborating on the number of markets where we see very interesting trajectory for new market. We've been speaking about Indonesia. We could have been speaking in addition to all the markets I've been covering. I could have been speaking about Mexico, where we have also a nice acceleration and we are just launching ILUMA. So the good thing is that we're not relying on one or two names, but we start to have a growing team of new markets where we see clearly, IQOS getting traction and increasing its stake. First, as always, in the big cities. That's where in many of these countries we have the biggest potential. But that's, I would say, happening in line with expectation. And as I said, we expect even a further acceleration in the second part of the year. We believe that then Taiwan will also start adding to the flow of this new market. So it's in line with expectation and clearly coming with a great potential. And as always, IQOS being perceived as, in many big cities rapidly as an aspirational product, which is extremely positive for the future and the brand franchise that we're going to be able to build there. Then on top of this new market and the IQOS trajectory in this new market, we have indeed bonds that we plan to develop in the future. We've been making the test, as we explained, in the Philippines and Colombia. We are working on the result. We are making a number of adjustments and will come with a detailed plan in the coming quarters. To make sure that we come with a product that has all the ingredients, all the features to be a great success. And we're working on it. That's going to be really important in all this market, because we know that the affordability here is different. To come with a portfolio that is segmented and where IQOS will have a role to play. But we need to also come with the rest of the portfolio bonds in order to cover this market. Sure, Owen. Of course, there is modest versus IQOS and ZYN in terms of impact at the group level. And we stick to our strategy, which is we don't want to be big in vaping if it's to lose money. We want to be really going with VEEV in markets where we are having the right commercial impact where VEEV can make a difference and in a profitable manner. Indeed, the year started well in terms of volumes. We have this outlook of moving into positive bottom line for VEEV in the second part of the year, which would be very good news. And we are prioritizing markets where we have the critical mass, where I would say the nature of the vaping market is interesting. And we are developing today very nicely, I would say, in markets such as Italy, Czech Republic, France, UK, developing in Canada. These are markets where we can reach, if you want, the size, the mass and where we have the impact to make our vaping business successful and profitable. Thank you for the question. So, first of all, on the German situation, I mean, yes, they've been asking for the view from the European Court of Justice. But it's a purely German question whether the way they've been implementing their extra tax was according to EU law or not. So there is no consequences for other countries. It's really a German question due to how they implemented this increase in the tax. So that's what it is. On the final decision, because as of today, that would be the decision from the German court. I have to say, I don't know when we will know more, I guess in the coming months, obviously. But I'm not going to be able to be more specific on the timing of the Dusseldorf court to make the decision. There are a number of steps still needs to be taken before they get there. So that will be for the coming months. But given where we are today, I'm not able to tell you when they will make the decision. Regarding your second question on price versus volume. So we said, and I'm going to stick to that. Yes, we believe that we can increase price more low single digits or not at the level of combustible on is not burn. Again, I think we are very clear on the very positive impact coming from the growth in volume from heat-not-burn our business. They're coming with a much higher per stick revenue. They're coming now with a higher gross margin rate, even at the level of just the consumable. It's significantly higher than for combustible as an average for the group. So that means that's really growing volumes is the name of the game for us. That's where it makes sense. Now, on top of it, given the very strong franchise of IQOS and the attractiveness of the brand, we are able to increase price without putting in danger the volume. But that's really the way you should be looking at it for us today. It's very much a play on maximizing the volumes. Thank you for your question, Gaurav. Look, I'm always very cautious, of course, as you can imagine, on commenting any kind of price strategy. So don't expect me to enter into any kind of detail. But conceptually, it is clear that as we build leadership in the category, as there is a growing adhesion from the nicotine user to heat-not-burn, there is a capacity for ongoing premiumization and more price increase without any doubt. But as I said, and as I explained, with the previous question, we believe that today still it's very much about maximizing the volumes. And that's what for us is important, of course, coming with great gross profit per stick and great contribution. So I'm certainly not closing the door to more price in the future. But I think I've been clear on what our priorities are. Having said that, as you know, in Japan, we need to have an agreement from the authority to increase the price. So I think it's something that is also sometimes regulated. So it doesn't mean that we have all the latitude that we would like to enjoy on the topic. So that's on the long-term. It is clear that today, as we've been discussing that already, you have the IQOS consumable that are positioned, even at some discount versus Marlboro. That gives an idea of the kind of increase that we'll be able to reach in the future, probably without too much, I would say, issues over time. Once again, it doesn't happen in one go. But as I explained for the time being, maximizing volume is the name of the game. And it's coming with, I think, what the Q1 is illustrating in a very bright manner, a very, very powerful mixed impact on our financial performance. Look, on Russia, you have to be a bit cautious on the shipment that you see. And that does not necessarily fully reflect the consumer offtake. You can have some movement from the surrounding countries. So I think we have to be cautious. So Russia is a market that has not been -- if I look at the past, I'm not sure that one quarter is enabling us to conclude anything. Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Russia has been a market that has not shown, unfortunately, any kind of meaningful growth. Today, we have no reason to believe that suddenly Russia is going to become a growth market, because nothing has changed fundamentally. And that's a country that has been impacted, of course, by currency depreciation that has been impacting the weight in the EPS. So I think that we were referring to 7% to 8%. I think we'll have to revise. And I don't have the number top of mind for 24 on the outlook, but that was the kind -- it was around 9, 10. And I think with the currency, it has been losing a bit of weight in the overall performance of the company. Thank you for your question. Well, first of all, I guess you are assuming that the ForEx headwind will persist in the coming years, which I think nobody can really say. We know that currency can be facing cycles and that it's true that the last 10 years have been about a strengthening of the dollar. We've been knowing other cycles where the dollar was more weakening versus at least other hard currency. So nobody knows what's going to happen. I think what we are saying and thank you for giving me the opportunity to maybe repeat and clarify that we are today in a position to put together very strong growth before ForEx. And I think you are seeing with the guidance for '24 that we are obviously coming still with a very dynamic top line, very much accelerating operating income growth. We are targeting a double-digit before currency impact now in 2024. And on top of that, we are going to price and in an environment that today we see positive for pricing, certainly with the fact that pricing on combustible is something that we can use now very tactically. We know that CC is not our future, so we can certainly use pricing very tactically in order to boost performance. We also are coming with some price increase at the level of HTU. We have some price increase on ZYN as well. So we have globally a pricing environment that looks attractive to us in the future. And then, when it comes to our cost, it is true that we've been investing a lot in the past years, and we've been reporting on all the action that we were having on investment across the board, in terms of innovation, in terms of science, in terms of R&D, in terms of manufacturing. Now is the time where, of course, we are reaching critical mass on smoke-free products. There are a number of things that we are doing that we can do more efficiently, a number of things that we've been learning and that we're going to implement in the continuation of our journey. So all that we believe is also giving us some very good ammunition and capacity to generate efficiency at a very high level in the future. So that's all the -- and they are quite important, quite numerous, all the levers that we own to deliver performance in dollar terms in the future. Well, can I answer you that your question is highly speculative because you asked me to compare with other businesses that are obviously very different in, I guess, the way they invest, their outlook, what they have to do. We are building here a business that has a tremendous growth potential, so we're not going to, of course, limit all the initiative, all the investment that we must do in order to keep growing the business and extract the full potential that we have with our smoke-free portfolio. Maybe that's different versus the paper business you were mentioning. I frankly have no clue because I don't know what you are referring to and the specific situation. But I think it's difficult to probably compare businesses that are facing different potential, different trajectories. That would be my answer. Bye-bye. Speak to you soon."

            "content": "Thank you, Emmanuel. I'm very pleased to be joining today's earnings call. As Emmanuel mentioned, our sustainability transformation and business strategies are one and the same. We're focused on creating value for the long term, where generating shareholder returns requires us to deliver on transformation, and delivering on transformation requires us to deliver on sustainability. As shown in our recent results, our product transformation fosters profitable growth and short, medium, and long-term value creation. However, our transformation also means reshaping both our value chain and how we engage with society. As we venture into new product categories, we actively collaborate with different stakeholders and advocate for regulatory frameworks that can accelerate industry change and end smoking. Business transformation is a company-specific journey, which sustainability reporting standards and frameworks often fail to adequately capture. To help illustrate our progress towards achieving our smoke-free purpose, we regularly report our business transformation metrics, a bespoke set of financial and non-financial KPIs. Some of them were already presented by Emmanuel in our financial results. Others you can see here. For example, the growing proportion of commercial and R&D spend on smoke-free products demonstrates the allocation of resources away from our legacy business and towards replacing cigarettes with better alternatives. As another example, increasing the availability and access of adult smokers around the world to smoke-free products are two key pillars of achieving this replacement. As our geographic expansion continues, low-and middle-income markets now make up 47% of our market presence. These metrics, together with our overall performance for 2023, can be found in our latest integrated report published last month and available on our website. It is a comprehensive document covering our most important sustainability topics, starting with our products. The report highlights progress on our continued expansion of smoke-free alternatives across categories and geographies, as well as social and environmental programs deployed with and in parallel to these products in support of sustainable value creation. This includes responsible marketing and sales practices, youth access prevention programs, and efforts to reduce post-consumer waste. Further, it highlights our progress on improving the quality of life of people in our supply chain, decarbonizing our operations and value chain, and preserving nature. We're also very pleased with the continued recognition of our sustainability performance and our robust reporting. To highlight just a few from 2023, PMI was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the first time and for the fourth year in the DJSI North America. In addition, PMI was the only U.S. company to obtain a AAA rating from CDP. More than 20,000 companies worldwide participated in this rating, and only 10 obtained this prestigious recognition. Notably, for investors in parts of Europe, but also in ESG or sustainability-themed funds in the U.S., we're subject to sector exclusion policies because we're a tobacco company. It is clear that excluding companies or sectors from the consideration set does nothing to address the underlying reasons for the exclusion, which in our case would be the harm linked to combustible tobacco use. Many funds that may be excluding tobacco on ESG considerations will still own stocks in other consumer sectors, despite many of these companies not having comparable harm reduction strategies in place to address the impact of their products. As we transform our company away from combustible and work to end smoking at a societal level, we welcome the engagement and challenge of investors to help us accelerate this critical shift. Thank you. I'll now turn it back to Emmanuel."
