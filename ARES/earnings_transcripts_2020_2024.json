At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday February 11, 2021. I will now turn the call over to Carl Drake, Head of Public Company Investor Relations for Ares Management. Please go ahead.\nCarl Drake: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter and 2020 year end conference call. I'm joined today by Michael Arougheti, our Chief Executive Officer and Michael McFerran, our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Bennett Rosenthal, Co-Chairman of our Private Equity Group; Kipp deVeer, Head of our Credit Group; Bill Benjamin, Head of our Real Estate Group; Scott Graves, Co-Head of our Private Equity Group; and Blair Jacobson, Co-Head of European Credit will also be available for the question-and-answer session.\nMichael Arougheti: Great. Thanks Carl, and good afternoon everybody. I hope that everyone is healthy and wish you well. This morning, we reported exceptional results for our fourth quarter concluding a very strong year for Ares, despite the challenging economic and market conditions brought on by the global pandemic. We achieved records in nearly every financial metric with full year growth in AUM and fee related earnings both exceeding 30%. Our AUM growth was driven by nearly $13 billion dollars of gross fund raising in the fourth quarter and $41 billion for the year, both all time records. As investors continue to entrust more of their capital to Ares and as we continue to demonstrate our ability to generate strong returns throughout market cycles. Our 44% fee related earnings growth for the fourth quarter and 31% for the full-year were driven by strong top line growth coupled with margin expansion from economies of scale. We were able to accomplish this while still investing substantially for future growth through the incubation of new products, new platforms and new strategies. Our FRE margins expanded throughout 2020 to a record 37% in the fourth quarter, an improvement of over 500 basis points year-over-year.\nMichael McFerran: Thank you, Mike. Hello everyone, I hope all of you are safe and well. I will start with a review of our results for the fourth quarter and the full year, then I will provide an update on where we stand nearly midway through the first quarter of 2021. Before going into the details, I will highlight that our fourth quarter results not only reflect the strong growth trajectory of our overall business, but they also reflect our greater scale, as we broke financial records, in nearly every category this quarter with record capital raising FRE, AUM fee-paying AUM, dry powder and AUM not yet earning fees. Our realized income was likewise strong, reflecting our record FRE, and strong realizations across our businesses. We ended the year, with our fastest growth rate of both AUM and fee-paying AUM in over a decade. For the fourth quarter FRE totaled $127.6 million, an increase of $20.7 million or 19% from the third quarter of 2020, and an increase of $38.9 million or 44% from the fourth quarter of 2019. FRE for the year ended December 31, 2020, totaled $424.5 million, an increase of approximately 31% from 2019. Our FRE for the fourth quarter, and year ended December 31, 2020 reflect an FRE margin for the quarter of 37% and 35% for the entire year of 2020. This represents nearly a 400 basis point increase and our full year margin as compared to full year 2019. FRE for the quarter was driven by record management fees totaling $335 million, an increase of approximately 23% over the fourth quarter of 2019. For the full year, management and other fees totaled over $1.2 billion, an increase of over 17% from 2019. Management fee growth for the fourth quarter reflected seasonally strong deployment and the fulfillment of some pent up demand, including record commitment originations from ARCC of more than $3.8 billion for the fourth quarter, which resulted in ARCC Part I management fees being about $15 million higher than the prior three quarter average. This resulted in an above average FRE contribution of about $6.3 million for the fourth quarter. Management fees also included the partial activation during the fourth quarter of our six corporate Private Equity Fund, which has paid a committed capital of approximately assuming approximately $4 billion. As a result, the management fee basis and rates step down for our predecessor fifth Private Corporate Private Equity Fund on January 1, but the impact will be partially offset by a full quarter of management fees from our six PE fund. Importantly, this is a moving target as we continue to fundraise for our six corporate private equity fund. Future closes will increase management and catch up fees, with each interim closing of LP commitments. Turning to expenses, compensation and general and administrative expenses grew by approximately 13% and 11%. From the fourth quarter and full year 2019 respectively. Our revenues continue to grow at a faster pace than our expenses, which supported margin expansion for the fourth quarter and full year. We always income for the fourth quarter totaled $186.2 million, which is up sharply from our third quarter. But down modestly from our record fourth quarter of 2019. Our private equity group generated over $1 billion in realizations in the fourth quarter, driven mainly by the sale or partial sale of two private portfolio companies. For all of 2020, we had private equity realizations of over $5 billion as Mike stated. After tax realize income per share of Class A common stock net of preferred stock distributions was $0.54 for the fourth quarter, down $0.67 in the fourth quarter of 2019. But full year 2020 after tax realized income of $1 86 per share of Class A stock was up 11% versus 2019. I do want to touch on our effective tax rates for 2020 and 2021. With respect to our 2020 taxes, our full year effective tax rate unrealized income, assuming all shares were converted to Class A common stock was approximately 11.5% with a tax rate and fee related earnings of approximately 7%. While our tax rate is the function of numerous variables, we currently estimate these effective tax rates for 2021 will be in the 8% to 13% range for realized income, and 4% to 8% range for fee related earnings, assuming 100% of our shares were converted to Class A common stock. This brings me to our annual dividend discussion. As a reminder, we peg our annual dividend to our expected growth and after tax fee related earnings per share. Based on our strong growth prospects, we have elected to increase our annual dividend for 2021 to $1 88 per share of Class A common stock up 17.5% from our $1.60 per share for 2020. Accordingly, our board declared our first quarter common stock dividend to be paid on March 31 of $0.47 per share, as Carl stated. Next I\u2019ll turn to our AUM and related metrics, as of yearend our AUM totaled $197 billion compared to $179.2 billion for the third quarter, a quarterly increase of nearly 10% and not more than 32% versus $148.9 billion at the end of 2019. Our AUM growth in the fourth quarter was largely driven by organic growth and strong asset appreciation, including gross new capital commitments of $12.8 billion, and market appreciation of $5.5 billion. In addition, Aspida\u2019s acquisition of F&G Re added $2.2 billion during the fourth quarter. Our fee-paying AUM totaled a $126 billion at year end, an increase of approximately 12% from the third quarter of 2020 and 30% from the year end 2019. Our growth in fee-paying AUM was primarily driven by meaningful deployment and our global direct lending, special opportunities and alternative credit strategies and new commitments across all three groups. Our available capital increased to a new record high of $56.3 billion, an increase of over 62%. Year-over-year. We ended the quarter with $40 billion of AUM, not yet or fees, of which approximately $37.1 billion is available for future deployment, and if deployed, corresponds to potential annual management fees totaling $401 million, which would be a 30% increase over the fourth quarter management fee run rate. With our significant available capital and dry powder, we remain very optimistic on the potential growth prospects ahead of us. Last, our incentive eligible AUM increased by nearly $30 billion to $117 billion and of this amount $46.5 billion was uninvested at year end. The fourth quarter saw continued appreciation of our net accrued performance income balance, which now sits at $364.7 million. This represents a 13% increase from the third quarter and a 5% year-over-year increase from the end of 2019. Despite substantial realizations over the course of the year, with record levels of incentive eligible AUM, including more than $46 billion that is uninvested, along with our net accrued performance income. We believe we have the foundation in place to generate and recognize meaningful long term value for shareholders through additional performance fees over time. And next, I\u2019d like to take a moment to address our very strong financial position and capital structure. We ended the year with over $1.5 billion in available liquidity between our $540 million in cash on the balance sheet, and no amounts drawn on our $1.065 billion corporate revolving credit facility. Our liquidity at year end has as well positioned to continue to support the organic growth of our firm, as well as be positioned to pursue continued inorganic strategic opportunities if and when they arise. Before turning the call back to Mike, I do want to provide our thoughts on our future outlook from a financial point of view. The capital raised to-date resulted in us ending the year with over $37 billion of AUM not yet earning fees available for deployment with corresponding potential annual management fees of over $400 million. And as Mike mentioned earlier, we are expecting 2021 to be another very strong year of fundraising. Accordingly, we are very well positioned to continue to drive management fee and in turn FRE growth in the years ahead to the capital we have raised and continue to raise. While we anticipate and may be difficult to match our record fourth quarters fee related earnings in the first quarter of this year. I do want to reiterate our prior guidance that we expect to be able to generate year \u2013over-year FRE growth of 15% or higher for 2021 and years ahead, and we do expect to achieve a run rate 40% margin in less than three years from the end of 2020. I'll now hand the call back to Mike for his thoughts on our future outlook and concluding remarks.\nMichael McFerran: Great, thanks, Mike. We've always said that Ares is a business that can perform throughout various market environments but that can particularly outperform in difficult markets. In our view, 2020 was a year that validated this all weather business model. We have long dated locked up capital and durable management fee centric revenue streams that aren't impacted by significant mark-to-market volatility. We have strong liquidity and capital markets access as well as a robust fundraising engine that allows us to grow through challenging markets. We also have considerable investing and information advantages that drive consistent outperformance through cycles. I believe that we have a best in class team. This is all against the backdrop of a long term growth trend and alternative investments. Our products are growing more relevant as investors remain frustrated with low interest rates and the dual challenges of high valuations and volatility in the traded markets. We're seeing investors consolidating the relationships among fewer trusted asset managers. And we continue to have strong success, expanding our share of our client dollars with larger successor funds, new strategies, strategic managed accounts, and by opening up new channels within retail and insurance. Heading into the New Year, we continue to be very excited for our organic and inorganic growth opportunities. We have a growing sticky client base of nearly 1100 institutional investors, and hundreds of 1000s of retail investors that helped fuel our growth with their appetite for additional Ares products. In 2020, more than 80% of our new capital raised was derived from existing clients, which we believe is the best validation of their satisfaction with our performance and their investment experience. We have record amounts of available capital that we can deploy for future growth in the years to come with over 500 investment professionals in over 20 offices in more than 10 countries. We're well positioned to scale our sourcing and investing appropriately across our many strategies and geographies. And from a strategic expansion standpoint, we're prioritizing the many growth opportunities in highly strategic large end markets where we can exploit our distinct competitive advantages. Our 2020 results illustrate the strong performance and growth of several of these businesses and strategies, including our special ops strategy and our PE Group, alternative credit and our credit group, Ares SSG and growth and broadening of our Real Estate Group. The investments that we've made in these businesses have been firing on all cylinders with respect to performance, capital raising and overall business momentum. We believe that these businesses illustrate some of the many areas that will drive long term growth for Ares and value creation for our shareholders in the years ahead. As I sit here today and I believe that our growth prospects have us as well positioned as at any time in our history, particularly as we continue to scale and realize the full potential of the new businesses that we're building. With that, I just want to end by expressing how impressed by and proud I am of the hard work, and the dedication of our team, and how grateful I am for all that they're doing every day to deliver for all of our stakeholders during these challenging times. I'm also deeply appreciative of all of the support from our investors for our company and I thank all of you for your time today. And with that operator, I think we will open up the line for questions.\nOperator:  Our first question today will come from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you, and hope you're all doing well and staying healthy too.\nMichael Arougheti: Thank you, Craig.\nCraig Siegenthaler: So Michael, I wanted to start with your forward commentary on the SPAC pipeline, and the sustainability of this trend. Because, besides pretty expensive stock market and very high retail engagement. What else are you seeing that could drive a continuation of the SPAC wave? And then my second part on this is thinking about it a different way how is this impacting the investing efforts of the private equity industry?\nMichael Arougheti: Sure, it's interesting, because obviously, there's a little bit of a SPAC frenzy it reminds me a little bit of what we experienced when we launched our BDC 15 years ago in 2003, 2004 when there was a similar frenzy and then kind of a settling out and evolution and maturation of the business. So telling you what you know, SPACs have been around for quite some time and supply/demand has ebbed and flowed, clearly the liquidity in the market is driving a lot of issuance and I think we're going to see dispersion in performance over time, the way that we've seen when new capital markets technologies come into the market. I think that Ares and others like us are actually well positioned to differentiate, not just in terms of size, but in terms of the go-to-market strategy. So I think to put it in perspective, when you look at where a lot of the SPAC volume is coming, it's smaller, non-sponsored if you will focused pools of capital. When you look at what we're trying to accomplish, this is really a cross platform opportunity. We think that we're going to bring differentiated origination infrastructure and relationships, unique market insights, obviously, a very long track record, of growing companies in the public market, both from an operational standpoint, but also a public IR standpoint. So I think we're going have to begin to try to differentiate institutional quality sponsorship from now on, that's comment number one, and number two, similar to the BDCs or the mortgage rates or anything else, I think anytime that we see opportunities for increased capital formation for companies, that's a good thing. Over time, with performance and experience, you'll start to see the structures potentially morph and change, but I think it's filling a need in the markets. That, is somewhat evidenced by the demand, which is if you look at the structure of the public markets leading up to 2020, for the last 15 to 20 years, the number of public companies has been in consistent decline. That's obviously been one of the big drivers of the private market trend that we're benefiting from. The market cap in public markets has been increasingly concentrated. And I think that there's been a view that in some respects, the retail investor has been disadvantaged or crowded out. So the idea that we're seeing innovation and capital formation, I think is a big positive. And while there's a little bit of excess in the market, I think that it's indicative of, people's appetite to access these types of companies where they didn't really have access before. In terms of what it means for PE, I think that still remains to be seen. I think it's important that people appreciate what makes a good leveraged buyout candidate does not necessarily make a good SPAC candidate. What makes a great public growth company does not necessarily make a great private entity. And I think what we're finding, which is why we have so much confidence in the structure sitting alongside our PE franchise, is most companies that want to go public are going to go public. And what we're finding whether we're buying companies or selling companies, the opportunity to look at a SPAC execution or private markets execution is going to be pretty meaningful origination advantage for us. So we think at least for our PE franchise, it's additive and supplements what we do and should make us a better originator, I do think that this will chip away a little bit at the aggregate market opportunity for PE when you just look at the amount of capital searching for transactions. And candidly, it will also chip away a little bit on the venture side and the growth equity side as well. But I think plenty of opportunity out there and we're just going have to see how it all plays out.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Great, thanks for taking both my questions.\nMichael Arougheti: Thanks, Craig. Stay well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.\nChris Harris: Thanks, guys. So, on their earnings call last night as part of their earnings release, AMP mentioned that they were having dialogue with Ares, about the sale of its asset management business. Can you guys comment on that? And related, are you looking at that entire business or just the alternatives component?\nMichael Arougheti: Sure, I can't comment in great detail, but maybe just to take a step back because it came up on our last earnings call as well. Obviously, we have a very well developed Corporate Strategy Team that is opportunistically looking for areas of expansion inorganically and organically. And we react to what the market shows us. This is unique situation because obviously AMP capital has a, strong global footprint in the private markets. I think that the comments from AMP accurately reflect where we are, which is that there is no transaction on the table for the entire company, and that we are having some constructive dialogue with them about transaction structures and partnership opportunities around their asset management business. I think that's all we can say for now, but as soon as we have more, more to tell folks, we're obviously going to do that.\nChris Harris: Okay, quick question for Michael McFerran if I can, Hey, Mike, it sounds like there's a lot of moving parts with the management fee outlook for at least Q1, can you maybe help us with understanding what the impact is from the step down of ACOF V in dollar terms?\nMichael McFerran: Sure. I think as I said in the prepared remarks that, ACOF V turned on during the quarter, ACOF V stepped down Jan 1. So to your point on moving parts, the way I think about the impact is based on the current size of ACOF VI, the impact would be, ACOF V is effective step down for a full quarter offset by ACOF VI for full quarter is about $6 million. That being said, again, I'd really emphasize that the timing of the incremental future closings of that fund, as you get paid on committed all the way back to first close would result in some volatility there, as you have closings, you're going to have catch up fees, hitting those quarters with those closings occur. So a lot of is just going to be based on when the next closings occur. So you might see a little noise in Q1, but I think as a percentage of overall management fees not overly significant. \nChris Harris: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America.\nMichael Carrier: Great, thanks for taking questions. Maybe first one just on deployment, I mean, given some of the higher valuations, the improving economy, a lot of capital out there is how is the opportunity set maybe changing? Can you provide some context just given how active you've been on the credit side, maybe where some of the valuations and what you're seeing, you know, differs from like the public market, and how you're thinking about the return out there?\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. It's a fascinating deployment environment and it's quite unique. And we talked about this, heading into Q4 on our last earnings call. What's so unique is obviously we've got high valuations and liquidity in the traded debt and equity markets that are reflecting higher valuations and a fairly bullish view on both forward earnings, technical liquidity in the markets and increased stimulus that is still a little bit detached from the fundamental economic reality in the economy. And so, when you think about what's going on, you've got to really think about public versus private Real Val , and then COVID, impacted versus non-COVID impacted Real Val . What's so unique about this opportunity for us is based on that bifurcated market, but also the number of strategies we have. The deployments have been very balanced. We had a record quarter in our private credit businesses in Q4, in regular way, kind of non-COVID related new issues and we had a significant deployment quarter in and around, the stressed and distressed parts of our business, in private equity, special opportunities, alternative credit, real estate, et cetera. So, unlike prior cycles, where we kind of see disproportionate distress or disproportionate healthy company investing, it's been very, very balanced. as a good example, I mentioned in our PE business, we had very active deployment in the depths of the crisis at really good entry points, both, distressed and then coming into the fourth quarter, regular way. So I would expect it to be a healthy deployment environment for us going into 2021. Because of that, obviously, the markets are healthy and that typically spurs a lot of transaction activity. The benefit also to the traded markets being a little bit disconnected from the private markets is obviously it shows up in our ability to monetize. So as we talked about, in the prepared remarks, when you look at our opportunity in places like AZEK and Mytheresa and others, the public markets are obviously pretty supportive, for monetization, and they're pretty constructive as we think about our liability profile and how we fund ourselves. And so whether it's add areas management, or add areas, capital Corporation or acre, hopefully people are seeing us take advantage of that market backdrop to drive the cost of our debt and customer equity down.\nMichael Carrier: Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the strategic front, you guys have been active, unlocking new strategies, and on the geographic front, but your comment on 80% of fundraising coming from current investors, as you said that the good thing but I just wanted to get an update on the LP base, and the growth outlook, particularly just given so many product opportunities, on the platform and some of these newer ones, kind of scaling up going forward?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, it's a great question. I think, we've talked about this before, and I would encourage people to look at some of the public available information in terms of our investor count, because typically when you look at the fund raising it's about in terms of number of investors, it's typically about 50/50 existing investors. But when you look at Capital, it tends to skew to 70% to 80%, of capital coming from new investors. So, the fundraising cycles or lifecycle of investor here, if you will, is they'll typically start in one part of our platform with a core commitment and then over time, they will not only grow in that, that part of our business with increasing commitment sizes, but then begin to invest across the platform. So when you look at the number of investors, the number of investors is steadily increasing year-over-year, despite the fact that we, you know, we're monetizing greater wallet share with those investors. So if you go look at our investor presentation, you'll see a nice depiction and how that plays out in terms of the percentage of investors that are getting cross sell, cross sold, if you will, into multiple funds in a given strategy, but then also, investing across multiple business lines and areas. So we continue to put a lot of global resources against our asset gathering and Investor Relations and infrastructure, it continues to pay significant dividends. But telling you what, the global demand for our product is significant and growing as well. So it seems that the more resources we put against it, we're just uncovering tons and tons of whitespace. So, I would expect that trend to continue.\nMichael Carrier: Alright, thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gerry O'Hara with Jefferies.\nGerald O'Hara: Great, thanks for taking my questions this morning. Maybe one from Mike McFerrin. And as it relates to the kind of glide path towards 40% or more in FRE margin, can you perhaps I assume, you know, ACOF VI is probably a big driver in that, but can you perhaps give us a little color as to what some of the other kind of material drivers of that margin expansion might be? And even if it's, just kind of scale on the business, but any color would be helpful. Thank you.\nMichael McFerran: Sure, Gerry. Hello. I said a couple quarters ago that if you looked at us, the last few years, we were expanding the margins on average between 150 and 250 basis points a year. Clearly 2020 as Mike talked about in the deployment statistics was a great year of revenue growth with managed expense growth. And that enabled us year-over-year to grow the margin 400 basis points. So, to your point on that glide path, I don't think it's really a function ACOF V1 per se, that's one fund out of many. It's I think the biggest thing I would look at is AUM not yet earning fees. And, the potential 400 plus million of management fees tied to that 37 billion of undeployed capital, as that capital gets deployed, that's coming in at a much higher margin than we're operating at because the expenses to invest to manage that capital RMC today. So it's really a function of time and a deployment. And when you have quarters, like the fourth quarter, where we had a great deployment, you see the margin benefit from that. Because there's not necessarily a corresponding expense that goes with it. So, we said, a couple quarters back, we thought we'd hit the run rate 40% in three years or less. I reiterated that in my prepared remarks, clearly of us having 37% this quarter and 35 for the year feels like we're definitely on that path. But it's not a function of a given font or anything else. I think we continue to manage expenses effectively as we have for several years and putting that existing capital to work.\nGerald O'Hara: Okay, that's definitely helpful. And then maybe one just on the insurance initiative with the, you know, the closure of the GE , and I think in the prepared remarks, I think there was some comments around kind of new initiatives forthcoming, but any additional kind of comments might be able to kind of add there or even appetite for future strategic opportunities as it relates to the insurance initiative would be helpful. Thank you.\nMichael McFerran: Yes, I don't think that there's anything new. So I'll just reiterate what we've said before, which is obviously it's a huge addressable market, both in terms of reinsurance and the annuities market. We believe that given our positioning as one of the largest global credit managers that we're uniquely positioned to source, unique assets and excess return for all of our insurance clients, including a speedo and  FRE, you'll see that just in the growth of our insurance client base over the years as we put more attention on that. And so today, we probably manage an excess of $10 billion for over 120 insurance clients. And obviously, as we get smarter around transaction structuring, and partners with these ensures it gives us a lot more confidence going into the market to originate unique assets for them up and down the capital STAC. The pieces are in place now for us to both organically and in organically scale the speed of platform and that's what we're going to continue to do. As we've mentioned, obviously, we've made a meaningful balance sheet commitment. To do that, we are adding appropriate resources in our Insurance Solutions platform to support that. And we continue to have very productive dialogue with our large LPs around strategically funding that business as well.\nGerald O'Hara: That's great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nMichael McFerran: Sure. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlex Blostein: Hey, guys, good morning. Good afternoon. Mike, I was hoping to get your kind of latest thoughts around sort of your opportunity set in the retail market. Obviously, you guys have ARCC but curious if there are other more kind of continuously raising retail vehicles you guys are thinking about in the private credit space, like we've seen with some of the other players in the in the space?\nMichael Arougheti: Sure, it's a great question, as we've talked about, retail is a big area of focus for all of us. I think we've been early and successful in that trend through traditional structures, obviously ARCC is effectively a way for retail investors to access our private credit franchise, and that company continues to deliver consistent performance. Same with the mortgage rate and our closed end credit fund, we have had some meaningful success, we haven't really talked about it a lot, but with our diversified credit interval fund, CadC, CadX. That's upwards of a billion dollars of equity NAV at this point, I think about $1.04 billion of assets and growing. We think that's a pretty unique growth vehicle for us in the interval, fund format. And then I think we like our peers will continue to try to innovate, that the challenge is we innovate is delivering the excess return in the private markets while solving for, some liquidity needs for the retail investor. And that's really been the challenge. I think we and others are beginning to solve for that and we're seeing scale. I would expect as we continue to build our brand within that channel that you should expect to see us with other product, whether that's, non-traded read product or net lease product and things like that, we continue to focus on it. So I think you'll see growth there. I think you'll see innovation, I think we're uniquely positioned given our credit business to create portfolios that meet that excess return, with liquidity profile that's required to satisfy the retail market. And so more to come on that but an area that we're spending a lot of time on and actually having some pretty meaningful success.\nAlex Blostein: Great, perfect. All right, we'll stay tuned for that. And my follow up question for the other Mike. I guess maybe a little bit of a higher level FRE question. But I guess if we look at the FRE momentum in the business over the last two years, right, like FRE grew 30% in 2020, grew 27% in 19. When you guys talk about, 15ish percent FRE growth, maybe it's a little bit over 15%, it's kind of hard to reconcile given the recent trend plus the super cycle plus they'll the deployment, right. So is this essentially just kind of a degree of conservatism or there's something that we're missing from the kind of recent FRE grocery trajectory versus were you seeing on the forward?\nMichael McFerran: No, there's no, there's nothing we're aware of that. I had we're anticipating, look, I'd emphasize we've used 15 plus percent. And I know when you look at this year, last year, clearly you could look at that and say, Are we just being too conservative, but we use that not just to talk about 21, but we used to talk about that. For the next several years ahead, and I think that's in my mind, the key point is the way the business is set up. And the amount of dry powder we have with management fees that have not yet turned online, kind of creates great visibility for us and continued revenue and FRE growth for the years ahead, and that I kind of think about a lot of the strategic stuff that we're building today that Mike's talked about, a lot of that's really about going to be driving FRE growth in 2024, 2025 and beyond. And so, again, I don't intend to be unnecessarily conservative, but so I would emphasize that's why we always say 15% plus.\nAlex Blostein: Perfect, yes, I just want to be sure when I was running in like any particular year. That's perfect. Thanks very much.\nMichael Arougheti: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Lee with KBW.\nRobert Lee: Hey, good morning or good afternoon, depending on where you are. Thanks for taking my questions. Most of them have been asked, but just two quick ones. And Mike, I apologize this did you touched on this earlier. But with all the new products in the pipeline are out there fundraising, a lot of our peers have also talked about raising kind of tech products or both of your products. And if I'm not mistaken, you guys have worked out a little bit of a growth orientation in your PE business, maybe at least relative to peers. So you just kind of curious if that's a control area you're looking at? And then maybe secondly, just as relates to the insurance strategy, just kind of where were things maybe stand with propone at this point?\nMichael McFerran: Sure, that's the simple answer to your first question, Rob, is yes. I think what we and our peers are experiencing is with our increasing scale, we are taking disproportionate wallet, from our LP clients collectively and frankly, disproportionate share in the market in terms of the investment opportunity. So I think we and others are uniquely positioned to onboard teams, make acquisitions, and then bring the competitive advantages and the benefits of scale to those, those platforms and accelerate growth and performance. And so, I think that you should expect to see that from us, as you've seen in the past. interesting when you look at what I think we're great at on the equity side, and you can really start dissecting our track record. Some of our strongest franchises are in healthcare, technology and financial and business services. And so given our middle market experience and the relationships that we have there, it's a pretty obvious adjacency, for us to leverage that into the growth end of the market and something we spent a lot of time talking about. With regard to Pavonia . I think we hopefully are coming to a resolution there. I don't want to be too committal here. But obviously, we have gotten sideways a little bit in terms of the level of distress that the selling shareholder of that, that company is undergoing. We've been working with the regulators to try to reach resolution. We think that we're getting close to the extent that we're not we are already planning for what that contingency is just given the amount of momentum that we have elsewhere in the business. So hopefully, we'll have a little bit more detail. We'll talk about next quarter in terms of the resolution of that specific transaction, but then also some of the other things we're doing to accelerate the growth of the annuities platform as well.\nRobert Lee: Right. Well, thanks for taking my questions, and everyone stay safe and healthy.\nMichael McFerran: You too, Rob. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey, good morning. Good afternoon. I wanted to follow up on some of the headcount additions you guys have made. So seems like you're making some investments here on the direct sourcing origination side. I was just hoping you could elaborate a bit more on how you're going about building that out where specifically are you expanding direct sourcing? Maybe you could talk about what you've been doing there and as you look out over the next year or so, I guess what would be next on your to do list as you think about expanding that out further.\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, I don't want to sound Cavalier with the answer, but the simple answer is everywhere. At the end of the day originations drives performance. The more deal flow we see, the more selective we can be, the better we can apply our relative value lens and theoretically, the better our investment performance. And I think we were early in learning that and as a result, I think that we were early in making the investments in the global sourcing apparatus that a lot of other people didn't. And we add in mature businesses. So as an example, if you look at our European direct lending business, by all accounts, we have the market leading franchise there, but we are opening up new geographies. So we've now in 2020, opened up an office in Amsterdam, we've opened an office in Madrid. And so you'll see us expanding geographically and mature businesses. You'll also see us expanding geographically and private equity. So we've been meaningfully building out our European team. Heading into fund six, deployment, there has been strong leveraging our existing footprint, and we'd expect to continue to invest there. So, similar to my comment on the fundraising, given the capability set we have in the capital, the marginal return on adding origination and investment people here is pretty high. And so while you will see us growing new businesses with a little bit more concentrated headcount addition, like we did with special opportunities, or like we did with alternative credit, the simple answer is it's pretty well dispersed and across the entirety of the platform. And that's just the nature of the growth that we were driving.\nMichael Cyprys: Maybe just on the credit side, would you be able to elaborate a bit more on, I guess, how would you characterize its focus on sponsor finance versus non-sponsor, finance origination? And then specifically on the non-sponsor, finance, asset based lending and so forth? Would you be able to elaborate on how you've been building out those sourcing capabilities and how you're thinking about that, looking forward?\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. It\u2019s a great question. And, again, I think we've had a meaningful head start in the growth of our global private credit franchise. The sponsor business continues to grow, just to put our direct lending franchise in perspective, I think last year, we did 220 discrete transactions committed over $20 billion to about 190 separate companies, and that was coming through close to 2400 deals, so that machine is fully cranked up. And what that allows us to do to your point, is invest in non sponsored and industry specific teams. And so we've been resourcing our traditional corporate business along new industry verticals, like software and technology, healthcare and life sciences, energy and energy infrastructure, sports, media and entertainment. And so we have shown a pretty high level of success, spending up industry teams, where we think that differentiated industry sourcing and information can help us drive better returns, and it will continue to do that. We've done more of that in the U.S. So I think that's a big opportunity for us as we develop more capability in Europe and Asia. ABL, I just want to clarify, we are meaningful players in both ABL and ABS meaning asset based and asset backed. Our area's commercial finance business, I think is one of the leading non bank asset based lenders with regard to working capital lines and revolvers. And our alternative credit business is very quickly becoming a scale player in all things asset based and asset oriented. I think that is a very significant untapped market opportunity for us across the risk return spectrum. And so we are adding a significant amount of resources there and we have over the last couple of years.\nMichael Cyprys: Great, thanks so much.\nMichael Arougheti: Thanks.\nOperator: And our last question will come from Adam Beatty with UBS.\nAdam Beatty: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to asked about Australia, you already talked about Amp a little bit, but just to broaden it out how you're seeing the environment there in terms of both fundraising and deployment and also maybe an update on the existing JV there. Thank you.\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. So Australia's a good growth market for us. We've been adding people and capital. On the primary investment side obviously it's a developed market. And so some of the, traditional private credit and private equity oriented strategies that we have are very relevant in the Australia, New Zealand market. Some of the earlier questions around our potential acquisition and partnership activity, there is probably a good indicator of our views of the opportunity said. Our joint venture with challenger for Dante is doing, what we hoped it would, we've launched our first product into the market early signs are being well received. And we're continuing to work on product development through that joint venture with a fair amount of success. So still early, but cautiously optimistic based on the early returns for the funds that we put into that joint venture.\nAdam Beatty: That's great. Appreciate it, Mike. Be well.\nOperator: This concludes our question and answer session, I would like to turn the conference back to Michael Arougheti for any closing remarks.\nMichael Arougheti: We don't have any other than to again, wish everybody well, stay safe and we do look forward to hopefully seeing everybody in person in the not gand not too distant future. And we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our conference call for today.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael McFerran",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Hello everyone, I hope all of you are safe and well. I will start with a review of our results for the fourth quarter and the full year, then I will provide an update on where we stand nearly midway through the first quarter of 2021. Before going into the details, I will highlight that our fourth quarter results not only reflect the strong growth trajectory of our overall business, but they also reflect our greater scale, as we broke financial records, in nearly every category this quarter with record capital raising FRE, AUM fee-paying AUM, dry powder and AUM not yet earning fees. Our realized income was likewise strong, reflecting our record FRE, and strong realizations across our businesses. We ended the year, with our fastest growth rate of both AUM and fee-paying AUM in over a decade. For the fourth quarter FRE totaled $127.6 million, an increase of $20.7 million or 19% from the third quarter of 2020, and an increase of $38.9 million or 44% from the fourth quarter of 2019. FRE for the year ended December 31, 2020, totaled $424.5 million, an increase of approximately 31% from 2019. Our FRE for the fourth quarter, and year ended December 31, 2020 reflect an FRE margin for the quarter of 37% and 35% for the entire year of 2020. This represents nearly a 400 basis point increase and our full year margin as compared to full year 2019. FRE for the quarter was driven by record management fees totaling $335 million, an increase of approximately 23% over the fourth quarter of 2019. For the full year, management and other fees totaled over $1.2 billion, an increase of over 17% from 2019. Management fee growth for the fourth quarter reflected seasonally strong deployment and the fulfillment of some pent up demand, including record commitment originations from ARCC of more than $3.8 billion for the fourth quarter, which resulted in ARCC Part I management fees being about $15 million higher than the prior three quarter average. This resulted in an above average FRE contribution of about $6.3 million for the fourth quarter. Management fees also included the partial activation during the fourth quarter of our six corporate Private Equity Fund, which has paid a committed capital of approximately assuming approximately $4 billion. As a result, the management fee basis and rates step down for our predecessor fifth Private Corporate Private Equity Fund on January 1, but the impact will be partially offset by a full quarter of management fees from our six PE fund. Importantly, this is a moving target as we continue to fundraise for our six corporate private equity fund. Future closes will increase management and catch up fees, with each interim closing of LP commitments. Turning to expenses, compensation and general and administrative expenses grew by approximately 13% and 11%. From the fourth quarter and full year 2019 respectively. Our revenues continue to grow at a faster pace than our expenses, which supported margin expansion for the fourth quarter and full year. We always income for the fourth quarter totaled $186.2 million, which is up sharply from our third quarter. But down modestly from our record fourth quarter of 2019. Our private equity group generated over $1 billion in realizations in the fourth quarter, driven mainly by the sale or partial sale of two private portfolio companies. For all of 2020, we had private equity realizations of over $5 billion as Mike stated. After tax realize income per share of Class A common stock net of preferred stock distributions was $0.54 for the fourth quarter, down $0.67 in the fourth quarter of 2019. But full year 2020 after tax realized income of $1 86 per share of Class A stock was up 11% versus 2019. I do want to touch on our effective tax rates for 2020 and 2021. With respect to our 2020 taxes, our full year effective tax rate unrealized income, assuming all shares were converted to Class A common stock was approximately 11.5% with a tax rate and fee related earnings of approximately 7%. While our tax rate is the function of numerous variables, we currently estimate these effective tax rates for 2021 will be in the 8% to 13% range for realized income, and 4% to 8% range for fee related earnings, assuming 100% of our shares were converted to Class A common stock. This brings me to our annual dividend discussion. As a reminder, we peg our annual dividend to our expected growth and after tax fee related earnings per share. Based on our strong growth prospects, we have elected to increase our annual dividend for 2021 to $1 88 per share of Class A common stock up 17.5% from our $1.60 per share for 2020. Accordingly, our board declared our first quarter common stock dividend to be paid on March 31 of $0.47 per share, as Carl stated. Next I\u2019ll turn to our AUM and related metrics, as of yearend our AUM totaled $197 billion compared to $179.2 billion for the third quarter, a quarterly increase of nearly 10% and not more than 32% versus $148.9 billion at the end of 2019. Our AUM growth in the fourth quarter was largely driven by organic growth and strong asset appreciation, including gross new capital commitments of $12.8 billion, and market appreciation of $5.5 billion. In addition, Aspida\u2019s acquisition of F&G Re added $2.2 billion during the fourth quarter. Our fee-paying AUM totaled a $126 billion at year end, an increase of approximately 12% from the third quarter of 2020 and 30% from the year end 2019. Our growth in fee-paying AUM was primarily driven by meaningful deployment and our global direct lending, special opportunities and alternative credit strategies and new commitments across all three groups. Our available capital increased to a new record high of $56.3 billion, an increase of over 62%. Year-over-year. We ended the quarter with $40 billion of AUM, not yet or fees, of which approximately $37.1 billion is available for future deployment, and if deployed, corresponds to potential annual management fees totaling $401 million, which would be a 30% increase over the fourth quarter management fee run rate. With our significant available capital and dry powder, we remain very optimistic on the potential growth prospects ahead of us. Last, our incentive eligible AUM increased by nearly $30 billion to $117 billion and of this amount $46.5 billion was uninvested at year end. The fourth quarter saw continued appreciation of our net accrued performance income balance, which now sits at $364.7 million. This represents a 13% increase from the third quarter and a 5% year-over-year increase from the end of 2019. Despite substantial realizations over the course of the year, with record levels of incentive eligible AUM, including more than $46 billion that is uninvested, along with our net accrued performance income. We believe we have the foundation in place to generate and recognize meaningful long term value for shareholders through additional performance fees over time. And next, I\u2019d like to take a moment to address our very strong financial position and capital structure. We ended the year with over $1.5 billion in available liquidity between our $540 million in cash on the balance sheet, and no amounts drawn on our $1.065 billion corporate revolving credit facility. Our liquidity at year end has as well positioned to continue to support the organic growth of our firm, as well as be positioned to pursue continued inorganic strategic opportunities if and when they arise. Before turning the call back to Mike, I do want to provide our thoughts on our future outlook from a financial point of view. The capital raised to-date resulted in us ending the year with over $37 billion of AUM not yet earning fees available for deployment with corresponding potential annual management fees of over $400 million. And as Mike mentioned earlier, we are expecting 2021 to be another very strong year of fundraising. Accordingly, we are very well positioned to continue to drive management fee and in turn FRE growth in the years ahead to the capital we have raised and continue to raise. While we anticipate and may be difficult to match our record fourth quarters fee related earnings in the first quarter of this year. I do want to reiterate our prior guidance that we expect to be able to generate year \u2013over-year FRE growth of 15% or higher for 2021 and years ahead, and we do expect to achieve a run rate 40% margin in less than three years from the end of 2020. I'll now hand the call back to Mike for his thoughts on our future outlook and concluding remarks. Great, thanks, Mike. We've always said that Ares is a business that can perform throughout various market environments but that can particularly outperform in difficult markets. In our view, 2020 was a year that validated this all weather business model. We have long dated locked up capital and durable management fee centric revenue streams that aren't impacted by significant mark-to-market volatility. We have strong liquidity and capital markets access as well as a robust fundraising engine that allows us to grow through challenging markets. We also have considerable investing and information advantages that drive consistent outperformance through cycles. I believe that we have a best in class team. This is all against the backdrop of a long term growth trend and alternative investments. Our products are growing more relevant as investors remain frustrated with low interest rates and the dual challenges of high valuations and volatility in the traded markets. We're seeing investors consolidating the relationships among fewer trusted asset managers. And we continue to have strong success, expanding our share of our client dollars with larger successor funds, new strategies, strategic managed accounts, and by opening up new channels within retail and insurance. Heading into the New Year, we continue to be very excited for our organic and inorganic growth opportunities. We have a growing sticky client base of nearly 1100 institutional investors, and hundreds of 1000s of retail investors that helped fuel our growth with their appetite for additional Ares products. In 2020, more than 80% of our new capital raised was derived from existing clients, which we believe is the best validation of their satisfaction with our performance and their investment experience. We have record amounts of available capital that we can deploy for future growth in the years to come with over 500 investment professionals in over 20 offices in more than 10 countries. We're well positioned to scale our sourcing and investing appropriately across our many strategies and geographies. And from a strategic expansion standpoint, we're prioritizing the many growth opportunities in highly strategic large end markets where we can exploit our distinct competitive advantages. Our 2020 results illustrate the strong performance and growth of several of these businesses and strategies, including our special ops strategy and our PE Group, alternative credit and our credit group, Ares SSG and growth and broadening of our Real Estate Group. The investments that we've made in these businesses have been firing on all cylinders with respect to performance, capital raising and overall business momentum. We believe that these businesses illustrate some of the many areas that will drive long term growth for Ares and value creation for our shareholders in the years ahead. As I sit here today and I believe that our growth prospects have us as well positioned as at any time in our history, particularly as we continue to scale and realize the full potential of the new businesses that we're building. With that, I just want to end by expressing how impressed by and proud I am of the hard work, and the dedication of our team, and how grateful I am for all that they're doing every day to deliver for all of our stakeholders during these challenging times. I'm also deeply appreciative of all of the support from our investors for our company and I thank all of you for your time today. And with that operator, I think we will open up the line for questions. Sure. I think as I said in the prepared remarks that, ACOF V turned on during the quarter, ACOF V stepped down Jan 1. So to your point on moving parts, the way I think about the impact is based on the current size of ACOF VI, the impact would be, ACOF V is effective step down for a full quarter offset by ACOF VI for full quarter is about $6 million. That being said, again, I'd really emphasize that the timing of the incremental future closings of that fund, as you get paid on committed all the way back to first close would result in some volatility there, as you have closings, you're going to have catch up fees, hitting those quarters with those closings occur. So a lot of is just going to be based on when the next closings occur. So you might see a little noise in Q1, but I think as a percentage of overall management fees not overly significant. Sure, Gerry. Hello. I said a couple quarters ago that if you looked at us, the last few years, we were expanding the margins on average between 150 and 250 basis points a year. Clearly 2020 as Mike talked about in the deployment statistics was a great year of revenue growth with managed expense growth. And that enabled us year-over-year to grow the margin 400 basis points. So, to your point on that glide path, I don't think it's really a function ACOF V1 per se, that's one fund out of many. It's I think the biggest thing I would look at is AUM not yet earning fees. And, the potential 400 plus million of management fees tied to that 37 billion of undeployed capital, as that capital gets deployed, that's coming in at a much higher margin than we're operating at because the expenses to invest to manage that capital RMC today. So it's really a function of time and a deployment. And when you have quarters, like the fourth quarter, where we had a great deployment, you see the margin benefit from that. Because there's not necessarily a corresponding expense that goes with it. So, we said, a couple quarters back, we thought we'd hit the run rate 40% in three years or less. I reiterated that in my prepared remarks, clearly of us having 37% this quarter and 35 for the year feels like we're definitely on that path. But it's not a function of a given font or anything else. I think we continue to manage expenses effectively as we have for several years and putting that existing capital to work.\nGerald O'Hara: Okay, that's definitely helpful. And then maybe one just on the insurance initiative with the, you know, the closure of the GE , and I think in the prepared remarks, I think there was some comments around kind of new initiatives forthcoming, but any additional kind of comments might be able to kind of add there or even appetite for future strategic opportunities as it relates to the insurance initiative would be helpful. Thank you. Yes, I don't think that there's anything new. So I'll just reiterate what we've said before, which is obviously it's a huge addressable market, both in terms of reinsurance and the annuities market. We believe that given our positioning as one of the largest global credit managers that we're uniquely positioned to source, unique assets and excess return for all of our insurance clients, including a speedo and  FRE, you'll see that just in the growth of our insurance client base over the years as we put more attention on that. And so today, we probably manage an excess of $10 billion for over 120 insurance clients. And obviously, as we get smarter around transaction structuring, and partners with these ensures it gives us a lot more confidence going into the market to originate unique assets for them up and down the capital STAC. The pieces are in place now for us to both organically and in organically scale the speed of platform and that's what we're going to continue to do. As we've mentioned, obviously, we've made a meaningful balance sheet commitment. To do that, we are adding appropriate resources in our Insurance Solutions platform to support that. And we continue to have very productive dialogue with our large LPs around strategically funding that business as well.\nGerald O'Hara: That's great. Thanks for taking my questions. Sure. Thanks. No, there's no, there's nothing we're aware of that. I had we're anticipating, look, I'd emphasize we've used 15 plus percent. And I know when you look at this year, last year, clearly you could look at that and say, Are we just being too conservative, but we use that not just to talk about 21, but we used to talk about that. For the next several years ahead, and I think that's in my mind, the key point is the way the business is set up. And the amount of dry powder we have with management fees that have not yet turned online, kind of creates great visibility for us and continued revenue and FRE growth for the years ahead, and that I kind of think about a lot of the strategic stuff that we're building today that Mike's talked about, a lot of that's really about going to be driving FRE growth in 2024, 2025 and beyond. And so, again, I don't intend to be unnecessarily conservative, but so I would emphasize that's why we always say 15% plus. Sure, that's the simple answer to your first question, Rob, is yes. I think what we and our peers are experiencing is with our increasing scale, we are taking disproportionate wallet, from our LP clients collectively and frankly, disproportionate share in the market in terms of the investment opportunity. So I think we and others are uniquely positioned to onboard teams, make acquisitions, and then bring the competitive advantages and the benefits of scale to those, those platforms and accelerate growth and performance. And so, I think that you should expect to see that from us, as you've seen in the past. interesting when you look at what I think we're great at on the equity side, and you can really start dissecting our track record. Some of our strongest franchises are in healthcare, technology and financial and business services. And so given our middle market experience and the relationships that we have there, it's a pretty obvious adjacency, for us to leverage that into the growth end of the market and something we spent a lot of time talking about. With regard to Pavonia . I think we hopefully are coming to a resolution there. I don't want to be too committal here. But obviously, we have gotten sideways a little bit in terms of the level of distress that the selling shareholder of that, that company is undergoing. We've been working with the regulators to try to reach resolution. We think that we're getting close to the extent that we're not we are already planning for what that contingency is just given the amount of momentum that we have elsewhere in the business. So hopefully, we'll have a little bit more detail. We'll talk about next quarter in terms of the resolution of that specific transaction, but then also some of the other things we're doing to accelerate the growth of the annuities platform as well. You too, Rob. Thank you."

            "name": "Michael Arougheti",
            "content": "Great. Thanks Carl, and good afternoon everybody. I hope that everyone is healthy and wish you well. This morning, we reported exceptional results for our fourth quarter concluding a very strong year for Ares, despite the challenging economic and market conditions brought on by the global pandemic. We achieved records in nearly every financial metric with full year growth in AUM and fee related earnings both exceeding 30%. Our AUM growth was driven by nearly $13 billion dollars of gross fund raising in the fourth quarter and $41 billion for the year, both all time records. As investors continue to entrust more of their capital to Ares and as we continue to demonstrate our ability to generate strong returns throughout market cycles. Our 44% fee related earnings growth for the fourth quarter and 31% for the full-year were driven by strong top line growth coupled with margin expansion from economies of scale. We were able to accomplish this while still investing substantially for future growth through the incubation of new products, new platforms and new strategies. Our FRE margins expanded throughout 2020 to a record 37% in the fourth quarter, an improvement of over 500 basis points year-over-year. Thank you, Craig. Sure, it's interesting, because obviously, there's a little bit of a SPAC frenzy it reminds me a little bit of what we experienced when we launched our BDC 15 years ago in 2003, 2004 when there was a similar frenzy and then kind of a settling out and evolution and maturation of the business. So telling you what you know, SPACs have been around for quite some time and supply/demand has ebbed and flowed, clearly the liquidity in the market is driving a lot of issuance and I think we're going to see dispersion in performance over time, the way that we've seen when new capital markets technologies come into the market. I think that Ares and others like us are actually well positioned to differentiate, not just in terms of size, but in terms of the go-to-market strategy. So I think to put it in perspective, when you look at where a lot of the SPAC volume is coming, it's smaller, non-sponsored if you will focused pools of capital. When you look at what we're trying to accomplish, this is really a cross platform opportunity. We think that we're going to bring differentiated origination infrastructure and relationships, unique market insights, obviously, a very long track record, of growing companies in the public market, both from an operational standpoint, but also a public IR standpoint. So I think we're going have to begin to try to differentiate institutional quality sponsorship from now on, that's comment number one, and number two, similar to the BDCs or the mortgage rates or anything else, I think anytime that we see opportunities for increased capital formation for companies, that's a good thing. Over time, with performance and experience, you'll start to see the structures potentially morph and change, but I think it's filling a need in the markets. That, is somewhat evidenced by the demand, which is if you look at the structure of the public markets leading up to 2020, for the last 15 to 20 years, the number of public companies has been in consistent decline. That's obviously been one of the big drivers of the private market trend that we're benefiting from. The market cap in public markets has been increasingly concentrated. And I think that there's been a view that in some respects, the retail investor has been disadvantaged or crowded out. So the idea that we're seeing innovation and capital formation, I think is a big positive. And while there's a little bit of excess in the market, I think that it's indicative of, people's appetite to access these types of companies where they didn't really have access before. In terms of what it means for PE, I think that still remains to be seen. I think it's important that people appreciate what makes a good leveraged buyout candidate does not necessarily make a good SPAC candidate. What makes a great public growth company does not necessarily make a great private entity. And I think what we're finding, which is why we have so much confidence in the structure sitting alongside our PE franchise, is most companies that want to go public are going to go public. And what we're finding whether we're buying companies or selling companies, the opportunity to look at a SPAC execution or private markets execution is going to be pretty meaningful origination advantage for us. So we think at least for our PE franchise, it's additive and supplements what we do and should make us a better originator, I do think that this will chip away a little bit at the aggregate market opportunity for PE when you just look at the amount of capital searching for transactions. And candidly, it will also chip away a little bit on the venture side and the growth equity side as well. But I think plenty of opportunity out there and we're just going have to see how it all plays out. Thanks, Craig. Stay well. Sure, I can't comment in great detail, but maybe just to take a step back because it came up on our last earnings call as well. Obviously, we have a very well developed Corporate Strategy Team that is opportunistically looking for areas of expansion inorganically and organically. And we react to what the market shows us. This is unique situation because obviously AMP capital has a, strong global footprint in the private markets. I think that the comments from AMP accurately reflect where we are, which is that there is no transaction on the table for the entire company, and that we are having some constructive dialogue with them about transaction structures and partnership opportunities around their asset management business. I think that's all we can say for now, but as soon as we have more, more to tell folks, we're obviously going to do that. Sure. It's a fascinating deployment environment and it's quite unique. And we talked about this, heading into Q4 on our last earnings call. What's so unique is obviously we've got high valuations and liquidity in the traded debt and equity markets that are reflecting higher valuations and a fairly bullish view on both forward earnings, technical liquidity in the markets and increased stimulus that is still a little bit detached from the fundamental economic reality in the economy. And so, when you think about what's going on, you've got to really think about public versus private Real Val , and then COVID, impacted versus non-COVID impacted Real Val . What's so unique about this opportunity for us is based on that bifurcated market, but also the number of strategies we have. The deployments have been very balanced. We had a record quarter in our private credit businesses in Q4, in regular way, kind of non-COVID related new issues and we had a significant deployment quarter in and around, the stressed and distressed parts of our business, in private equity, special opportunities, alternative credit, real estate, et cetera. So, unlike prior cycles, where we kind of see disproportionate distress or disproportionate healthy company investing, it's been very, very balanced. as a good example, I mentioned in our PE business, we had very active deployment in the depths of the crisis at really good entry points, both, distressed and then coming into the fourth quarter, regular way. So I would expect it to be a healthy deployment environment for us going into 2021. Because of that, obviously, the markets are healthy and that typically spurs a lot of transaction activity. The benefit also to the traded markets being a little bit disconnected from the private markets is obviously it shows up in our ability to monetize. So as we talked about, in the prepared remarks, when you look at our opportunity in places like AZEK and Mytheresa and others, the public markets are obviously pretty supportive, for monetization, and they're pretty constructive as we think about our liability profile and how we fund ourselves. And so whether it's add areas management, or add areas, capital Corporation or acre, hopefully people are seeing us take advantage of that market backdrop to drive the cost of our debt and customer equity down. Yes, it's a great question. I think, we've talked about this before, and I would encourage people to look at some of the public available information in terms of our investor count, because typically when you look at the fund raising it's about in terms of number of investors, it's typically about 50/50 existing investors. But when you look at Capital, it tends to skew to 70% to 80%, of capital coming from new investors. So, the fundraising cycles or lifecycle of investor here, if you will, is they'll typically start in one part of our platform with a core commitment and then over time, they will not only grow in that, that part of our business with increasing commitment sizes, but then begin to invest across the platform. So when you look at the number of investors, the number of investors is steadily increasing year-over-year, despite the fact that we, you know, we're monetizing greater wallet share with those investors. So if you go look at our investor presentation, you'll see a nice depiction and how that plays out in terms of the percentage of investors that are getting cross sell, cross sold, if you will, into multiple funds in a given strategy, but then also, investing across multiple business lines and areas. So we continue to put a lot of global resources against our asset gathering and Investor Relations and infrastructure, it continues to pay significant dividends. But telling you what, the global demand for our product is significant and growing as well. So it seems that the more resources we put against it, we're just uncovering tons and tons of whitespace. So, I would expect that trend to continue. Sure, it's a great question, as we've talked about, retail is a big area of focus for all of us. I think we've been early and successful in that trend through traditional structures, obviously ARCC is effectively a way for retail investors to access our private credit franchise, and that company continues to deliver consistent performance. Same with the mortgage rate and our closed end credit fund, we have had some meaningful success, we haven't really talked about it a lot, but with our diversified credit interval fund, CadC, CadX. That's upwards of a billion dollars of equity NAV at this point, I think about $1.04 billion of assets and growing. We think that's a pretty unique growth vehicle for us in the interval, fund format. And then I think we like our peers will continue to try to innovate, that the challenge is we innovate is delivering the excess return in the private markets while solving for, some liquidity needs for the retail investor. And that's really been the challenge. I think we and others are beginning to solve for that and we're seeing scale. I would expect as we continue to build our brand within that channel that you should expect to see us with other product, whether that's, non-traded read product or net lease product and things like that, we continue to focus on it. So I think you'll see growth there. I think you'll see innovation, I think we're uniquely positioned given our credit business to create portfolios that meet that excess return, with liquidity profile that's required to satisfy the retail market. And so more to come on that but an area that we're spending a lot of time on and actually having some pretty meaningful success. Thank you. Yes, I don't want to sound Cavalier with the answer, but the simple answer is everywhere. At the end of the day originations drives performance. The more deal flow we see, the more selective we can be, the better we can apply our relative value lens and theoretically, the better our investment performance. And I think we were early in learning that and as a result, I think that we were early in making the investments in the global sourcing apparatus that a lot of other people didn't. And we add in mature businesses. So as an example, if you look at our European direct lending business, by all accounts, we have the market leading franchise there, but we are opening up new geographies. So we've now in 2020, opened up an office in Amsterdam, we've opened an office in Madrid. And so you'll see us expanding geographically and mature businesses. You'll also see us expanding geographically and private equity. So we've been meaningfully building out our European team. Heading into fund six, deployment, there has been strong leveraging our existing footprint, and we'd expect to continue to invest there. So, similar to my comment on the fundraising, given the capability set we have in the capital, the marginal return on adding origination and investment people here is pretty high. And so while you will see us growing new businesses with a little bit more concentrated headcount addition, like we did with special opportunities, or like we did with alternative credit, the simple answer is it's pretty well dispersed and across the entirety of the platform. And that's just the nature of the growth that we were driving. Sure. It\u2019s a great question. And, again, I think we've had a meaningful head start in the growth of our global private credit franchise. The sponsor business continues to grow, just to put our direct lending franchise in perspective, I think last year, we did 220 discrete transactions committed over $20 billion to about 190 separate companies, and that was coming through close to 2400 deals, so that machine is fully cranked up. And what that allows us to do to your point, is invest in non sponsored and industry specific teams. And so we've been resourcing our traditional corporate business along new industry verticals, like software and technology, healthcare and life sciences, energy and energy infrastructure, sports, media and entertainment. And so we have shown a pretty high level of success, spending up industry teams, where we think that differentiated industry sourcing and information can help us drive better returns, and it will continue to do that. We've done more of that in the U.S. So I think that's a big opportunity for us as we develop more capability in Europe and Asia. ABL, I just want to clarify, we are meaningful players in both ABL and ABS meaning asset based and asset backed. Our area's commercial finance business, I think is one of the leading non bank asset based lenders with regard to working capital lines and revolvers. And our alternative credit business is very quickly becoming a scale player in all things asset based and asset oriented. I think that is a very significant untapped market opportunity for us across the risk return spectrum. And so we are adding a significant amount of resources there and we have over the last couple of years. Thanks. Sure. So Australia's a good growth market for us. We've been adding people and capital. On the primary investment side obviously it's a developed market. And so some of the, traditional private credit and private equity oriented strategies that we have are very relevant in the Australia, New Zealand market. Some of the earlier questions around our potential acquisition and partnership activity, there is probably a good indicator of our views of the opportunity said. Our joint venture with challenger for Dante is doing, what we hoped it would, we've launched our first product into the market early signs are being well received. And we're continuing to work on product development through that joint venture with a fair amount of success. So still early, but cautiously optimistic based on the early returns for the funds that we put into that joint venture. We don't have any other than to again, wish everybody well, stay safe and we do look forward to hopefully seeing everybody in person in the not gand not too distant future. And we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Wednesday, October 28, 2020.  \n I will now turn the call over to Carl Drake, Head of Public Company Investor Relations for Ares Management. Please go ahead. \nCarl Drake: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for our third quarter 2020 conference call. I'm joined today by Michael Arougheti, our Chief Executive Officer; and Michael McFerran, our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. \n In addition, we have a number of executives available for the question-and-answer session today, including Bennett Rosenthal, Co-Chairman of our Private Equity Group; Kipp deVeer, Head of our Credit Group; Bill Benjamin, Head of our Real Estate Group; and Matt Cwiertnia, Co-Head of our Private Equity Group.\n Before we begin, I want to remind you that comments made during this call contain forward-looking statements and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those identified in our risk factors within our SEC filings. Our actual results could differ materially, and we undertake no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Please note that past performance is not a guarantee of future results.\n During this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, note that our management fees include ARCC Part I fees. Please refer to our third quarter earnings presentation available on the Investor Resources section of our website for reconciliations of the measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Ares fund.\n This morning, we announced that we declared our fourth quarter common dividend of $0.40 per share, representing an increase of 25% of our dividend for the same quarter last year. The dividend will be paid on December 31, 2020, to holders of record on December 17, 2020. We also declared our quarterly preferred dividend of $0.4375 per Series A preferred share, which is payable on December 31, 2020, to holders of record on December 15, 2020.\n Now I'll turn the call over to Michael Arougheti, who will start with some quarterly financial and business highlights. \nMichael Arougheti: Great. Thanks, Carl, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope you're all healthy, and I wish you well. Despite the broad effects of the COVID crisis, we continue to execute well across all of our core functional areas with record-setting third quarter results. Our third quarter saw a year-over-year growth of 24% in our assets under management, driven by a record quarter of fundraising; 23% growth in our fee-related earnings; and nearly 50% growth in our realized income, as we monetize some investments in a strengthening equity market. We also continue to see the benefits of scale as we reported our highest FRE margins since our IPO. I'm also pleased to say that our fund performance was generally strong against the backdrop of an improving economy and favorable technicals in the liquid markets. Going forward, we continue to believe that our business is well-positioned to grow fee-related earnings by at least 15% per year in the years ahead.\n During the third quarter, our deployment was a little more measured compared to previous periods, as market transaction activity was slower and in transition. During the third quarter, we invested $3.9 billion from our drawdown funds versus $4.7 billion in the second quarter, with a continued focus on providing scaled flexible solutions to private companies, particularly in our global direct lending, special opportunities and alternative credit strategies. We are starting to see a significant pickup in M&A transaction activity in both North America and Europe, which we expect will create a healthy backdrop for both deployment and monetization. We're also seeing some interesting opportunities for undervalued assets in certain sectors within the public markets such as real estate, where there's been considerable volatility. For example, we recently made a convertible preferred investment in a Zurich-based publicly traded residential property owner with attractive German assets. We believe significant underlying value exists in this stable asset class in a core European market. Also, just last week, we announced that we're partnering with a specialized asset manager and a take-private of a public single-family rental company where we see an opportunity for value creation. This last deal is a perfect example of how we're collaborating more actively across our platform and leveraging our scale, our deal flow and unique market information to navigate the current environment. In this specific situation, funds managed by both our real estate equity and alternative credit strategies collaborated to bring a flexible and scaled solution to this company. This was a natural fit for our real estate strategy, given our leadership's experience in the asset class, and it also fits well with our alternative credit strategy, which looks for diversified pools of assets with strong contractual cash flow.  \n As another example, our special opportunity strategy recently partnered with our direct lending team to commit to a first-lien rescue capital facility to a global leader in the transportation industry.  \n Now turning to fundraising. The case for investing alternatives continues to be very compelling. Investors remain frustrated with low interest rates and the dual challenges of high valuations and volatility in the traded markets. In addition, the long-term trend of investors consolidating their relationships among fewer trusted managers with a broad product offering is ongoing. We continue to expand our wallet share with our clients, and we believe that we have a long runway for growth as they increase both their alternative allocations and their LP fund commitments across our platform. We continue to see evidence of this in the attractive re-ups into existing strategies, coupled with a desire to commit new capital across multiple other area strategies.\n The third quarter was our largest fundraising quarter ever, with $12.7 billion of organic gross capital raised, which puts us at more than $28 billion for the first 9 months. Year-to-date, we've raised capital directly from over 250 institutional investors, including approximately 150 existing Ares investors and 100 new to our platform. The existing investors accounted for 81% of the capital raised, which we believe is a testament to our consistent and strong performance and the deep relationships that we've built with our investors over the last 20-plus years.  \n Specific to our third quarter fundraising, approximately $8.2 billion, or more than EUR 7 billion, was raised from the initial closings for our fifth flagship European direct lending fund that was launched just 5 months ago in May. We're already nearly 10% above our previous fund size, and we're well on our way to hitting our target for LP commitments of EUR 9 billion. Once finished, we expect that this will be the largest ever European direct lending fund, which reflects our market leadership in this attractive and growing segment. To date, 89 investors have committed, including 65 existing investors and 24 new investors. And of note, 8 investors committed EUR 250 million or more to the fund.  \n During the third quarter, we also continued to make progress with additional fund closings totaling approximately $3 billion across our other credit strategies, including alternative credit, liquid credit and U.S. direct lending. Of note, post-quarter end, our alternative credit flagship fund reached its original target of $2 billion. Given the considerable investor momentum and strong investment pipeline, we're planning for additional closings in the coming months before concluding the fundraise. Our alternative credit strategy has increased its AUM by more than 50% in the last 6 quarters, and remains a significant future growth opportunity for us.\n Our sixth flagship corporate PE fund has closed on commitments of $3.7 billion to date. We expect to hold another closing by year-end and plan to hold the final closing in the first half of 2021. We've initiated toehold investments in the fund. And as we sit here today, we have a strong pipeline of both traditional and distressed opportunities. We also had initial closings of $235 million in our climate infrastructure fund that focuses on the energy market transition and additional inflows to Ares SSG's senior secured direct lending fund, which is now approaching $1 billion in commitments.  \n Our fundraising momentum is continuing into the fourth quarter with a significant forward pipeline. If folks recall, we shared on our last quarterly call that we were focused on surpassing $30 billion in gross fundraising commitments for the year. Based on incremental closings in October, we've already achieved that goal, and we believe that there's an opportunity to meet or exceed our record fundraising year of $36 billion that we saw in 2018. Looking forward, we currently have over a dozen commingled fundraises that either are in the market or expected to be launched in the next 12 months. And collectively, these funds are targeting equity capital commitments of more than $25 billion incremental to the amounts that we have closed through the end of the third quarter.\n Outside of these commingled funds, our fundraising efforts will certainly continue with our managed accounts and strategic partnerships, public funds, other commingled funds, new funds and various closed-end vehicles, all of which traditionally account for a significant amount of our annual capital raised. We saw positive fund performance gains across our significant funds in Q3. The performance was led by strong returns in our corporate private equity and special opportunity strategies, which generated quarterly gross returns between 6% and 9%. Our European direct lending and liquid credit composites also generated gross returns ranging between 2.7% and 4.5%. Our U.S. flagship direct lending fund, Ares Capital Corporation, continued to see improved performance with a third quarter net return of 6.5%. Our real estate equity composites also generated positive quarterly returns ranging from approximately 2% to 6%.  \n From a monetization perspective, during the third quarter, we took advantage of the strengthening equity markets, and we generated realized income from the final sale of our Floor & Decor position in ACOF III. In addition, we sold a minority position in ACOF IV portfolio company, the AZEK company, which completed an IPO earlier in the year. We're so happy to see both companies prospering in the public markets. And as the private market backdrop is now improving and equity markets continue to be strong, we'll continue to be opportunistic on the monetization front.  \n So lastly, before I turn the call over to Mike, I want to provide a brief update on our insurance initiatives through our Ares Insurance Solutions platform. Last month, we announced that our subsidiary, Aspida, is acquiring the reinsurance subsidiary of FGL Holdings, and that it entered into a strategic partnership with FGL Holdings for a flow reinsurance agreement. Once closed, we believe this platform will accelerate our plans to grow Aspida, both organically through additional reinsurance transactions, and through possible acquisitions. Our growth plans remain the same, and we continue to expect to support this Ares-sponsored insurance and annuity platform largely with third-party capital. Of note, we continue to enhance our leadership team within Ares Insurance Solutions as we just added Raj Krishnan, the former CIO of F&G, as our CIO for Ares Insurance Solutions.  \n And now I'll turn the call over to Mike McFerran for his remarks on our business positioning and financial results. Mike? \nMichael McFerran: Thanks, Mike. Hello, everyone. I hope all of you are safe and well. I'd like to begin with some high-level comments on the quarter before turning to more detailed review of our results and financial position. The third quarter marks our 14th consecutive quarter of FRE growth, which highlights the strong growth trajectory of our overall business, and the benefits that we are deriving from greater scale. As Mike highlighted, this quarter represents several new financial milestones for the business, with our largest ever quarter of capital raising, our largest single first close of a fund with our fifth flagship European direct lending fund, quarterly FRE in excess of $100 million, record AUM, fee-paying AUM, dry powder and AUM not-yet-earning fees. In addition, we closed on our acquisition of SSG Capital at the beginning of the third quarter, adding approximately $6.9 billion in AUM and $4.3 billion in fee-paying AUM. In connection with this acquisition, we are reporting Ares SSG within strategic initiatives, along with other strategic ventures that will include Aspida upon the closing of its F&G reacquisition.  \n With that, I'll go through the details of the quarter. Fee-related earnings for the quarter totaled $106.8 million, an increase of 23% from the third quarter of 2019. Year-to-date, our FRE of $297 million was up 26% compared to the same period last year. This growth, despite the economic fallout from COVID-19, illustrates the resilience of our business and the trust our investors have in us. Our continued FRE growth demonstrates the durability and consistency of our management fee-driven business model. Our results for the quarter reflect an FRE margin of 35%, up from 33% a year ago, and we expect to continue to deliver further margin expansion. Based upon the timing of deployment and market conditions, we believe that we can grow margins by 150 to 300 basis points per year, and target achieving a run rate 40% margin within 3 years, if not sooner.\n With $12.7 billion of gross fund raised in the quarter, our AUM and fee-paying AUM reached new highs, increasing 24% and 21%, respectively, over the last 12 months. This fundraising drove our Shadow AUM to a record high of $39.3 billion for the quarter, an increase of nearly 50% year-over-year. Our management fees totaled $300.1 million for the quarter, which represents a 15% increase over the prior year. In comparison, total expenses, consisting of compensation and G&A, were $198.2 million, representing an 11% increase over the prior year. Realized income for the quarter totaled $146.4 million, which represents an increase of nearly $50 million or 49% as compared to the third quarter of 2019. Our private equity group recognized over $1 billion in realizations in the third quarter, driven mainly from sales in Floor & Decor and the AZEK Co, which contributed to our year-over-year increase in realized income. After-tax realized income per share of Class A common stock, net of preferred stock distributions, was $0.48 for the third quarter, an increase of 41% from the third quarter of 2019.  \n Next, I'll turn to our AUM and related metrics. As of September 30, our AUM totaled $179.2 billion compared to $158.4 billion for the second quarter, a quarterly increase of 13%. Our AUM growth was largely driven by gross new capital commitments of $12.7 billion, significant market appreciation of over $4 billion and $6.9 billion from the SSG Capital acquisition. Year-over-year, our AUM has grown 24%. Our fee-paying AUM increased 21% year-over-year driven by meaningful deployments in our global direct lending, special opportunities and alternative credit strategies. We ended the third quarter with $112.7 billion of fee-paying AUM, which breaks down approximately 72% credit funds, 16% private equity funds, 8% real estate funds and 4% strategic initiatives funds. Our available capital increased to a new record high of $52.5 billion, an increase of over 55% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with $39.3 billion of AUM not-yet-paying fees, of which approximately $36.3 billion is available for future deployment, and if deployed, corresponds to annual management fees totaling $386 million. With our significant available capital and dry powder, we remain very optimistic on the potential growth prospects ahead of us. Last, our incentive eligible AUM increased by more than $19 billion to $105.6 billion, and of this amount, $41.5 billion was uninvested at quarter end.\n The third quarter saw a continued appreciation of our net accrued performance income balance, which now sits at $322.5 million. This represents a 12% increase from the second quarter, and a 37% increase from the lows at the end of the first quarter earlier this year. With record levels of incentive eligible AUM, including more than $40 billion that's uninvested, along with our net accrued performance income, we believe we have the building blocks in place to generate and recognize meaningful long-term value through additional performance fees over time.  \n Next, I'd like to take a moment to address our robust financial position and capital structure, especially since the beginning of the year. Last quarter, we took advantage of the low interest rate environment by issuing $400 million in 10-year notes at a 3.25% rate, which further increased our flexibility and strength in this market cycle. We ended the quarter with nearly $2 billion in liquidity, with $869 million in cash on the balance sheet and no amounts drawn on our $1.065 billion corporate revolving credit facility. Importantly, we have no maturities until 2024, and we have cash in excess of all of our outstanding debt of $226 million. As we previously announced, our outstanding $300 million of 7% perpetual preferred stock is callable as of June 2021. And as this day gets closer, we will re-evaluate calling and retiring this equity as is comparatively expensive, especially compared to our newly issued interest deductible debt.\n With substantial liquidity and a strong balance sheet, we are in a compelling position to be more aggressive, if and when we see fit, going into the final quarter of 2020 and beyond. This gives us the option of further scale in strategic areas. With continued possible market volatility and election-related uncertainty, we remain very well-positioned and capitalized to take advantage of any strategic opportunities that may arise.\n I'm now going to turn this back to Mike for concluding remarks. \nMichael Arougheti: Great. Thanks, Mike. We have long said that Ares is one of those unique and differentiated \"all-weather\" businesses. It's a business that can perform in various market environments and has outperformed in difficult markets. Our business isn't just demonstrating great durability and resilience in the current market backdrop, but we're also experiencing strong forward momentum. This is most evident from our record financial results and our capital raising success. \n Our cycle-tested approach, the breadth of our capabilities and our competitive advantages are all serving us well during these challenging markets, and we see this in our fund level performance and the differentiated deal flow we originate. I think our capital raising underscores the diversification of our business. We're able to not only grow and scale our comparatively mature businesses, like PE and direct lending, but we can now leverage our strength to scale some of our comparatively more recent businesses like special opportunities and alternative credit. And lastly, our ability to execute on new strategic initiatives, organic and inorganic, is a solid reminder that we're a consolidator in a growing market and that we have multiple avenues for continued long-term growth. As Mike mentioned, we're fortunate to be well-capitalized to execute on these exciting growth opportunities.\n With all that said, I want to conclude by expressing just how impressed and proud I am of the grit and the hard work and the dedication that our team is demonstrating and how grateful I am for all that they're doing to deliver for all of our stakeholders in these challenging times. We also deeply appreciate all of our investors' continuing support for our company, and we thank all of you for your time today. And with that, operator, I think we're ready to open up the line for questions. \nOperator: Thank you. We would like to apologize for the issues we encountered at the beginning of today's call. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. \n [Operator Instructions]\n Our first question comes from Robert Lee with KBW. \nRobert Lee: I guess, Mike, I'm just kind of curious, I mean, we're hearing that -- not just from you but some of your peers, that the deployment outlook is getting better. And clearly, your investing performance has been good. But what are you seeing more broadly from the competitive universe? I mean are you seeing signs, maybe particularly in credit that maybe some competitors are starting to fall away because they were caught flat -- more flat-footed by what's happened? And what kind of -- if that's the case, what kind of opportunities or not is that creating, whether it's on deployment, acquisition or greater capture of the LPs? \nMichael Arougheti: Sure. There's a lot in there, so I'll try to hit most of it. And then if you have a follow-up, we can drill down. Anytime we go through a crisis of the depth and magnitude like the one that we're going through now, we always see market share consolidation. And as we've talked about in past quarters, there is an overarching secular trend in alternatives for the larger platforms getting larger. And we've long believed that, unlike in the liquid markets, where size can sometimes hurt performance, in alternatives, at least based on the way that we go about the business, we have found that the larger we get, the more we can invest in competitive advantages and the better our performance is. So I think this crisis is no different in that respect than in past crises. And how we consolidate that share takes many forms. \n So to your point, we out-deploy, because we have scaled capital and flexible capital to pivot as the market develops. So you'll see that in our deployment in the first 9 months of the year, where we were much more active in the liquid markets through the first 4 or 5 months of the year, pivoted actively into the private markets across the platform through the middle of the year on rescue loans, and now are pivoting yet again into the regular way buyout market as the economy starts to heal and capital comes off the sidelines. \n So I think in order to succeed through the cycle, the way that we have, you have to be able to play each and every opportunity that gets put in front of you, and you have to have the capital and the people to execute well. So yes, those that went into the crisis with weaker portfolios, weaker balance sheets, less capability, I think, are experiencing this crisis much differently than we and some of our larger peers are. I also think that that's showing up in the fundraising. We hear anecdotally that the smaller single-asset managers are actually having a very challenging time raising capital in the work-from-home environment, juxtapose that with us and the larger peers who I think are all enjoying very significant success across multiple products. \n And then lastly, I think with regard to deployment picking up, we've often talked with all of you about the 3 phases of the cycle, one being that first phase, where the liquid markets were not functioning and we were active playing liquid distress; the second phase being kind of where we are now, which is largely rescue capital opportunities and taking advantage of people's need for liquidity in both, what I would call, high-quality assets with bad balance sheets or high-quality balance sheets in decent-quality asset pools, and that's been a lot of what we've been doing through the middle of the year. \n And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the deployment was probably slower in Q3, just as a result of the markets were normalizing. And now, as we head into the end of the year, I think the combination of people coming off the sidelines with a lot of pent-up demand for deployment, some prospect for economic recovery, albeit uneven, some tax-driven selling on the part of asset owners. And I think a view that low rates are going to support asset prices for a longer time. We are seeing very, very significant pickup in deployment across the platform. And when we get into that phase of the cycle, as we talked about, that's kind of the sweet spot, because you still have people who are poorly capitalized. So the distressed opportunity does not go away, but you now have the opportunity to pick and choose between regular way flow for non-COVID-impacted assets and companies, relative to the more COVID-impacted. So we're pretty optimistic about deployment and monetization going into the end of the year and into -- early into 2021. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Gerry O'Hara with Jefferies. \nGerald O'Hara: Great. Perhaps one for Mike McFerran, and just picking up a little bit around that 40% target that you mentioned with -- as it relates to FRE margin over the next 3 years. Perhaps you could unpack that a little bit and give us maybe a little sense of what gives you kind of confidence of hitting that target, obviously? Maybe what could accelerate it? Or perhaps even push it out. But any additional color you could provide around that number would be helpful. \nMichael McFerran: Sure. Happy to, Gerry. Yes, I'll start with we -- as you know, we don't put forward a lot of forward-looking items like that. So while we can't guarantee anything, in the past when we've made outlook statements about where we think the margin would be in others, I think we've hopefully either consistently met it or under-promised and over-delivered. So I think as far as the risk of being getting pushed back out, I think that's low. Our margin over the last 12 months has expanded 230 basis points, and over the last 2 years, has expanded about 540 basis points. The -- what's going to impact it and the timing of it is really timing of deployment. I mean, when we talk about our AUM not-yet-earning fees, which -- meaning if we continue to grow this quarter with all of our capital raising, when we put that capital to work and the market backdrop for doing so is going to bring those management fees online. \n Gerry, I know you've heard us talk about in the past, it's really the life cycle of our business is the cost related to that capital are already embedded in the firm today in our investment teams, our capital raising teams, our non-investment functions. So we are operating with those expenses leading in front of that revenue coming online. And as a result, when that revenue comes online, it comes in at a much higher-margin than we operate at. So it really is going to be a function of that. But when we look at the amount of AUM not-yet-earning fees, the funds that's related to and how, frankly, just a continued expense discipline and trajectory of the business, I felt 40% with -- as a run rate within 3 years was definitely achievable, and it may happen, well, sooner. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nCraig Siegenthaler: I wanted to start with ACOF V, and I know it's still a young fund, but I wanted your perspective on how the businesses are positioned and doing? And also on the performance since inception. \nMichael Arougheti: Sure. We have Matt and Bennett on. Why don't we -- we'll let them handle that. \nMatthew Cwiertnia: Great. Fantastic. So this is Matt Cwiertnia. I'll start, and Bennett can join in. So ACOF V, to answer the question, we feel very good and very optimistic about the fund. We break it into 2 parts: one, being the nonenergy portfolio, and we think we have populated that part of the portfolio with what we call franchise companies, just great companies that are continuing to weather this crisis, and we think have very good long-term opportunities in front of them. So we feel very good about the nonenergy portfolio. On the energy side, we've had some challenges this year, but I think we've worked very hard to restructure a lot of the balance sheets of those investments, and give those companies and those management teams a lot of time and operating room to make their way into a hopeful recovery of the energy markets over time. When you put those 2 together, we are still optimistic about ACOF V being a good fund in the long term. I think that does have a little bit of recovery in the energy markets that needs to take place for that to happen, but we feel good about what we've done, what we control to try and position that energy portfolio for success in the long term. \nCraig Siegenthaler: And just on the energy exposures, are you able to quantify how large that allocation is within the larger ACOF V? And also are those exposures generally upstream, midstream or downstream assets? \nMatthew Cwiertnia: Sure. So I'll start again, taking the second one first. It's primarily in midstream assets. Today, the energy portfolio is about 19% of the remaining value in the ACOF funds overall. And from a fund V perspective, we're probably now, on an energy basis, closer to sort of 40% on the invested side, and less on the fair-value side. And so for us, getting that energy portfolio back towards making back our money in that portfolio and beyond is sort of what our goal and our hope is. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. \nKenneth Worthington: Maybe just some questions about the insurance business. Is the competitiveness of the insurance market business for alternative managers rising? We did see some competition for AEL recently. I'm not sure if that's a one-off or are you seeing more of that. And whether the deal for F&G was competitive or not, could you highlight maybe the factors beyond price that influenced Ares' sort of win of that deal? \nMichael Arougheti: Sure. So I would characterize it as competitive but organized competition in the sense that Ares and those that look like us are all seeing the same long-term trend, which is the insurance market is struggling with low interest rates for longer. And long duration liabilities with the inability to generate asset returns to meet the needs of that portfolio. So if you just think about the evolution of that dynamic, not surprisingly, prior to folks like us aligning more strategically with insurance company platforms, we were managing and continue to manage a significant amount of capital on behalf of insurance company clients, because the name of the game is to transition to being just a liability-oriented manager and start to figure out how you can actually generate differentiated asset performance and excess return. \n And I expect that, that trend is here to stay, will continue and will accelerate. It is a very large market. I think there's plenty of room for all of us to continue to build our insurance businesses alongside our core business. But what I would comment on is actually expanding the playing field, if you will, for what it means to be an alternative fixed income manager. So a lot of the product that makes sense for the insurance company clients or the captive insurers is higher up the balance sheet, what I would call, fixed income, traditional fixed income alternatives or high-grade fixed income alternatives as opposed to some of the historically traditional private credit assets. So in many respects, it's expanded the opportunity set for folks like us. \n And the competition, like I said, it's consistent. So those of us who have a commitment to building the insurance business are building it, but we have not seen a lot of new entrants coming in because, again, I think you need differentiated sourcing at scale, right? And you need the access to the capital. And so I think the people who are in the market are the ones that are going to continue to scale. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. \nMichael Carrier: Just overall, investment performance has been strong for you guys. But the longer COVID is around, it tends to have more of an impact on some of the smaller and the middle-market companies. So just given your scale in that part of the market, what are you seeing in terms of areas of challenges or possible opportunities? And have prices gotten cheap enough to shift into some areas that you guys have avoided thus far through the cycle? \nMichael Arougheti: Yes. So I'm glad you bring up middle market kind of as a concept to think about how the crisis is playing out, because Ares is squarely a middle-market firm. But the definition of middle market obviously continues to expand. There's probably no better place to look than ARCC and some of the comments that Kipp and the team made yesterday around average issuer size now in excess of $100 million of EBITDA and some of the return opportunities that we're seeing there relative to smaller companies. So I believe smaller companies obviously have fewer levers to pull in navigating the crisis. They have less consistent access to liquidity, maybe less durable business models or less institutional-quality opportunities for exit. And so we would expect to see more stress in the lower end of the market than the upper end. I think, fortunately, most of our deployment is in the upper end of the market, and so you can see how that's benefited performance of the in-place book. As we continue to get more clarity around the forward earnings picture, yes, there should be an opportunity for us, whether it's through our special opportunities business, alternative credit or direct lending to go in and be a liquidity provider to those companies and those asset owners. I will tell you right now, that's not where we're seeing the best relevant value, because we're putting money to work actually at higher rates of return and higher-quality assets given the capital inefficiency. There's just a lot of people who can write a check into a smaller company situation relative to people who have our capital scale, and that's actually creating a little bit of a perversion in terms of the risk-adjusted return opportunity down market. But if history is any indicator, clearly, that should present itself to us both in terms of buying portfolios, but also coming in with rescue loans to individual assets and individual companies. \nMichael Carrier: Got it. Okay. And then just on the -- your -- some of the strategic moves that you guys have made to position areas for growth, opportunities in Asia. I know it's still early on some of the moves that you made, but just wanted to see how it has been in early days in terms of the progress, particularly given that, at least from a COVID standpoint, some things seem in some of those markets to be kind of further along or more past? \nMichael Arougheti: Yes, it's interesting. And one of the reasons why we wanted to build-out in Asia, as we've talked about, is clearly, that's where a significant amount of global GDP growth is going to come over the next 20 years. But we also want to have a window into other parts of the world as -- despite the current administration's view, as the economy globalizes, we want to be global. It is an interesting juxtaposition, because those economies are in a different phase in terms of the recovery, and so their opportunity set is developing along a slightly different trajectory. But as I mentioned earlier, our Asian vehicles have the ability to invest flexibly through the cycle the same way that our European and U.S. do. So similar to the path that we've been on, where they were active in the liquid markets, earlier in the crisis, and now we're starting to pivot more towards regular way investing, they're mirroring that. Deployment has been very strong, particularly in our special situation strategies there. And as I mentioned, we're in the market now fundraising for our third senior direct lending fund, and that's already, as I mentioned, close to $1 billion on a $1.2 billion cover having been launched in COVID. So far, so good. Obviously, it's early, but the value proposition that we underwrote both in terms of scale, window into the world and return generation is all playing out as we had hoped. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. \nAlexander Blostein: So Mike, I wanted to ask you about M&A broadly, both as a buyer, but also maybe as a seller, there's obviously been a lot more speculation much more than the traditional side of the world, but the alternatives is where the growth is, and we're obviously seeing some firms comment on that as well. So how do you guys think about the momentum you're having in the business today relative to an opportunity either as a buyer to partner with somebody for distribution or the other way around if somebody could plug you into their distribution and accelerate growth that way? So I know a little bit of bigger picture, but curious to get your thoughts on that. \nMichael Arougheti: Sure. It's a great question. And we've, I think, been pretty transparent that we believe that there is a long-term, and I would emphasize long-term trend of convergence in asset management between retail and institutional as well as traditional and alternative. And so if I look forward 10-plus years, I think those lines will continue to blur as these business models continue to evolve and move towards scale. \n I think the challenge we have, candidly, is when you look at the fundamentals in our business, we've been growing 15% to 25% per year across every functional area and every financial metric. We have secular tailwinds in terms of the appetite for our assets. The structure of our business doesn't have the mark-to-market volatility, the risk of outflows or the risk of fee compression that you see in the traditional space and so on and so forth. So it's hard, frankly, for us to want to lead into that convergence trend, because we have such wind at our back, continuing to execute on our playbook in alternatives that to divert our attention towards business models that are struggling for growth, struggling for margin expansion, struggling for performance. It's hard to see the industrial logic in that. But we do have an eye on what is a long-term vision for the future, where there will be great asset managers and not great asset managers globally. And I think we have to be open to new definitions of what it means to be alternative or what it means to be traditional. \n In the meantime, as you've seen, we will continue to be active on the acquisition front, where we can add new capability, new distribution, new geographies that we think will accelerate our growth into the favorable backdrop. As we've talked about before though, the bar for acquisitions is getting higher because as we've demonstrated with things like special opportunities or alternative credit, we're now at a size and capability where we can bring teams onto the platform, surround them with capital and structure and actually grow pretty sizable businesses organically in a way that's just much more accretive to long-term value creation than buying. So while we look at all things, the bar, while it's always been high, I think, is getting higher, just given our ability to organically grow some of these step-out strategies. \nAlexander Blostein: Great. Makes sense. Agree with all that. A cleanup question for the other Mike. On the new segments, the strategic initiatives segment, the way you guys break it out, can you help us think through sort of the growth path there on the asset and fee side? And also the incremental margins there, because from the segment reporting, it looks like the margin is obviously quite high in that part of the business. Just curious about sort of sustainability of that margin and how that sort of translates with more fees in AUM coming in into that part of the model over time? \nMichael McFerran: Yes. Look, that's going to be, again, a growing area. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we saw Ares SSG's in there, Aspida is going to be in there. So it's -- I would -- I think it would be challenging to try and focus too much on the margin of that business because that business is going to have different themes going into it. And as segments evolve and grow, something will probably -- I expect over time, will grow out of that segment to become their own segments in the future. So I know you're looking for some modeling direction on it. That's, I think, challenging. \n What I would say is -- by the way, when you look at the margin, I would highlight that we're reporting that segment consistent with our others. So a portion of the costs that relate to what we would call more corporate activities of themes of that segment are in the Operations Management Group segment. So I think that's in the Appendix of our earnings presentation. So you'll see some of that there. So this is more -- this is definitely an apples-to-apples comparison to our other business lines. But look, I think once after we have F&G reclosed, it'd be a little easier to look at it with a couple of themes that -- you'll start to see more of a run rate around it. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. \nChristopher Harris: Another question on the insurance business. Look, I know it's very, very early days for you guys here, and you highlighted how big the market opportunity is. When we just step back and look at the environment, I mean, interest rates are just so low. Do you think this business can still be an organic grower with interest rates where they are? Or for now, will this -- will growth in this business be more about M&A opportunities? \nMichael Arougheti: Yes. I think it's both. We've talked about before, one of the benefits of our approach is that we have not been encumbered by any large legacy balance sheet exposures and the way that we're approaching the build of our insurance platform. So I think if we were sitting on a large legacy book and we had to deal with the in-force liabilities in this rate environment, we may feel differently. But here's what we know. With low rates, everybody is going to be struggling to generate the asset returns that they need to support their actuarial models. And that's true whether you're a pension fund or insurance company or an individual. And so low rates in and of themselves, I think, are going to continue to drive people to need to think about savings, but think about how they generate return through the retirement. So I think the whole retirement market, annuities at the top of the list, is going to continue to grow. At the end of the day, the way that we and others are [Audio Gap] this business is it's a spread-lending business. And so as long as we can continue to use our differentiated origination and structuring to generate excess spread, then it will continue to be a growth vehicle for us. And I'm pretty confident that's the world that we're going to be living in. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Beatty with UBS. \nAdam Beatty: In the commentary, you highlighted a cross-asset deal involving real estate. And just wanted to get a sense of to broaden that out, how much -- how many of those types of opportunities that you're seeing and/or generating perhaps in real estate or perhaps otherwise? And how you feel you're competitively positioned for deals like that? \nMichael Arougheti: Sure. So those who have known us a long time, Adam, have always heard us talk about what we call the power of the platform and collaborative culture. And I know a lot of people talk about similar approaches. I actually think that it's harder to execute on than many people appreciate. I think many businesses have looked like ours that didn't grow up with the sense of partnership and collaboration that we have, can get siloed and not have aligned incentives, and that can create some constraints to the type of active collaboration that we are highlighting in the prepared remarks. That is core to who we are and how we invest in any environment. So as an example, if you harken back a couple of quarters, when we did a unitranche for a company called Ardonagh, which was the largest European unitranche ever recorded at close to $2 billion, that was actually done as a collaboration between our U.S. direct lending team and our European direct lending team. \n So that's a regular part of the business. And the reason that, that happens is a lot of these situations are going to force -- they're forcing mechanisms for these teams to come together, either there's a need for capital scale or it's a hybrid, a net lease transaction where you want to bring credit expertise together with real estate expertise or, in the case of this unitranche, you have a a U.S. sponsor looking at a European asset. So the market is kind of pushing us into that active collaboration. \n When you get into a crisis like the one we're in now, all of those catalysts for collaboration just get amplified, because there's so many unique situations that have structural challenges in them where, if we can bring capital scale, capital flexibility, unique information, insights, relationships, et cetera, it's better for everybody. So I would say, now more than ever, we're collaborating now more than we ever have, but it's not unique just to be in the middle of a crisis. It's core to how we manage the business and core to the culture in terms of how people think about partnership here. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. \nMichael Cyprys: I was just hoping you guys could dive in a bit more on the organic initiatives, in particular, the newer organic initiatives, the ones you're most excited about there, special sits, I imagine that's one of them. You guys have raised some capital there. I guess, what are some of the others that maybe on the cusp of raising capital where you've hired folks, where you've been building out teams, which ones could be raising capital in the next year or 2? How are you thinking about extending out into additional adjacencies from here? \nMichael Arougheti: Yes. So I don't want to give a -- I don't want to give away some trade secrets here. So I'll just highlight, in our prepared remarks, we talked about funds that are kind of in the queue over the next 12 months that we think will generate $25 billion-plus of incremental equity capital commitments in excess of what we had raised through the end of the quarter. Embedded in that are a number of step-out strategies, and those are going to be in adjacent markets. So for example, leveraging our direct lending expertise into specific industries. It may be leveraging our healthcare expertise in private equity into other parts of the healthcare market and ecosystem. So I don't want to be evasive, but there's so many interesting things that we're incubating. I'd rather wait till they're birthed and we have something to talk about and then happy to drill down on it. But what you're highlighting is key to how we're driving the type of growth rate that we are and special opportunities is a great example. Alternative credit is another one, where, obviously, we've been able to grow that asset base by 50% over the last 1.5 years organically by bringing new folks and new capital solutions onto the platform. So we have a number of those types of situations that are very far along. And I think, over the next couple of quarters, you'll get some good exposure to what those are. \nMichael Cyprys: Okay. Maybe I could just ask a follow-up on your infrastructure investing business. I was just hoping you can kind of give an update there on how that looks today. What are some of the opportunities that you're seeing on -- not just on the deployment front, but also just from further scaling and growing that platform? And what might the opportunity set be if we get a blue wave here that maybe has an infrastructure spending bill, how might that change or catalyze any sort of growth? \nMichael Arougheti: Yes. So we are in the market, as we mentioned, and we had a first close in the quarter on our infrastructure strategy, which has now been, for the most part, fully repositioned into what we call climate infrastructure. And that team, both on the credit and equity side is now 100% focused on investing money into the energy transition, and that's both renewable infrastructure, sustainable infrastructure and renewable technology. That is where the market is going, that is where the opportunity for investment will be. It's also consistent with where we stand from an ESG-focused standpoint, I think where our investors stand as well. The deployment there has been very exciting, and it ranges the entire waterfront of the energy transition from renewable power generation to technology around vehicle electrification battery storage, residential, solar and things like that. So it really runs the gamut. \n I think a blue wave would be a massive catalyst for that business, given the way that we've positioned the team and the capital there. The current administration has actually been favorable for renewables despite the fact that I think those folks probably feel like they're more heavily supportive with the fossil fuel industry. We've actually seen the business thrive just because there's so much happening at the state and local level and at the consumer preference level that's kind of pulling that change through as well. But yes, if we have a blue wave and a big renewable energy infrastructure bill, that's going to unlock a pretty significant opportunity set for us. \n And in terms of where it is -- yes -- and you said where it could go, obviously, the range of what I would call sustainable infrastructure is broader than just wind and solar. So I think you would see us continue to broaden out there. And then geographically, right now, we've been limiting our investment in the U.S. market, but I would expect to see us continue to look to other geographies as that business expands as well. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays. \nJeremy Campbell: One of the high levels got asked already, so maybe just a quick spotlight on expenses for Mike McFerran. First, thanks for that color on FRE margins over time, so this might be a little more around cleanup near-term geography of cost. But looks like corporate expenses went up about $8 million quarter-over-quarter, since you guys bought up your stake in a pretty wholly-formed business. Wondering if that lift was from corporate type costs from SSG or majority stake that didn't really flow into the segment? Or if there was something else going on here? \nMichael McFerran: Good question. I'd say about $2 million of G&A this quarter was related to that. So I think I had said last quarter, I kind of thought we would -- G&A would probably be, prior to including SSG, in the low 40s, so we're back $2 million off, it's $41.8 million. This quarter, we did have some nonrecurring expenses related to some of the capital raising, as you could appreciate, when you're raising a lot of money, timing of just book expenses related to work around that, including a lot of professional fees and restructuring costs will be a little more volatile. But G&A, to me, felt a little elevated this quarter, again, a function of just adding SSG and just all the capital raising. Good reason for it, frankly. \nJeremy Campbell: Got it. Yes, exactly. And then as we look ahead to the FG reclose, is there going to be any lift on the corporate side there, too? Or is that going to flow mostly through this segment? \nMichael McFerran: It's going to flow into the segment. \nOperator: I'm showing no further questions. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mike Arougheti for any closing remarks. \nMichael Arougheti: No, we appreciate everybody spending time with us. We hope everybody stays safe and well. And we look forward to speaking with everybody next quarter. And I also do want to congratulate my L.A. colleagues on the Dodger win, as a disgruntled Yankee fan, tough to see, but in the spirit of partnership, I'm happy for all of you. So congratulations, and we'll talk to everybody next quarter. Thanks. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our conference call for today.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael McFerran",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Hello, everyone. I hope all of you are safe and well. I'd like to begin with some high-level comments on the quarter before turning to more detailed review of our results and financial position. The third quarter marks our 14th consecutive quarter of FRE growth, which highlights the strong growth trajectory of our overall business, and the benefits that we are deriving from greater scale. As Mike highlighted, this quarter represents several new financial milestones for the business, with our largest ever quarter of capital raising, our largest single first close of a fund with our fifth flagship European direct lending fund, quarterly FRE in excess of $100 million, record AUM, fee-paying AUM, dry powder and AUM not-yet-earning fees. In addition, we closed on our acquisition of SSG Capital at the beginning of the third quarter, adding approximately $6.9 billion in AUM and $4.3 billion in fee-paying AUM. In connection with this acquisition, we are reporting Ares SSG within strategic initiatives, along with other strategic ventures that will include Aspida upon the closing of its F&G reacquisition.  \n With that, I'll go through the details of the quarter. Fee-related earnings for the quarter totaled $106.8 million, an increase of 23% from the third quarter of 2019. Year-to-date, our FRE of $297 million was up 26% compared to the same period last year. This growth, despite the economic fallout from COVID-19, illustrates the resilience of our business and the trust our investors have in us. Our continued FRE growth demonstrates the durability and consistency of our management fee-driven business model. Our results for the quarter reflect an FRE margin of 35%, up from 33% a year ago, and we expect to continue to deliver further margin expansion. Based upon the timing of deployment and market conditions, we believe that we can grow margins by 150 to 300 basis points per year, and target achieving a run rate 40% margin within 3 years, if not sooner.\n With $12.7 billion of gross fund raised in the quarter, our AUM and fee-paying AUM reached new highs, increasing 24% and 21%, respectively, over the last 12 months. This fundraising drove our Shadow AUM to a record high of $39.3 billion for the quarter, an increase of nearly 50% year-over-year. Our management fees totaled $300.1 million for the quarter, which represents a 15% increase over the prior year. In comparison, total expenses, consisting of compensation and G&A, were $198.2 million, representing an 11% increase over the prior year. Realized income for the quarter totaled $146.4 million, which represents an increase of nearly $50 million or 49% as compared to the third quarter of 2019. Our private equity group recognized over $1 billion in realizations in the third quarter, driven mainly from sales in Floor & Decor and the AZEK Co, which contributed to our year-over-year increase in realized income. After-tax realized income per share of Class A common stock, net of preferred stock distributions, was $0.48 for the third quarter, an increase of 41% from the third quarter of 2019.  \n Next, I'll turn to our AUM and related metrics. As of September 30, our AUM totaled $179.2 billion compared to $158.4 billion for the second quarter, a quarterly increase of 13%. Our AUM growth was largely driven by gross new capital commitments of $12.7 billion, significant market appreciation of over $4 billion and $6.9 billion from the SSG Capital acquisition. Year-over-year, our AUM has grown 24%. Our fee-paying AUM increased 21% year-over-year driven by meaningful deployments in our global direct lending, special opportunities and alternative credit strategies. We ended the third quarter with $112.7 billion of fee-paying AUM, which breaks down approximately 72% credit funds, 16% private equity funds, 8% real estate funds and 4% strategic initiatives funds. Our available capital increased to a new record high of $52.5 billion, an increase of over 55% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with $39.3 billion of AUM not-yet-paying fees, of which approximately $36.3 billion is available for future deployment, and if deployed, corresponds to annual management fees totaling $386 million. With our significant available capital and dry powder, we remain very optimistic on the potential growth prospects ahead of us. Last, our incentive eligible AUM increased by more than $19 billion to $105.6 billion, and of this amount, $41.5 billion was uninvested at quarter end.\n The third quarter saw a continued appreciation of our net accrued performance income balance, which now sits at $322.5 million. This represents a 12% increase from the second quarter, and a 37% increase from the lows at the end of the first quarter earlier this year. With record levels of incentive eligible AUM, including more than $40 billion that's uninvested, along with our net accrued performance income, we believe we have the building blocks in place to generate and recognize meaningful long-term value through additional performance fees over time.  \n Next, I'd like to take a moment to address our robust financial position and capital structure, especially since the beginning of the year. Last quarter, we took advantage of the low interest rate environment by issuing $400 million in 10-year notes at a 3.25% rate, which further increased our flexibility and strength in this market cycle. We ended the quarter with nearly $2 billion in liquidity, with $869 million in cash on the balance sheet and no amounts drawn on our $1.065 billion corporate revolving credit facility. Importantly, we have no maturities until 2024, and we have cash in excess of all of our outstanding debt of $226 million. As we previously announced, our outstanding $300 million of 7% perpetual preferred stock is callable as of June 2021. And as this day gets closer, we will re-evaluate calling and retiring this equity as is comparatively expensive, especially compared to our newly issued interest deductible debt.\n With substantial liquidity and a strong balance sheet, we are in a compelling position to be more aggressive, if and when we see fit, going into the final quarter of 2020 and beyond. This gives us the option of further scale in strategic areas. With continued possible market volatility and election-related uncertainty, we remain very well-positioned and capitalized to take advantage of any strategic opportunities that may arise.\n I'm now going to turn this back to Mike for concluding remarks. Sure. Happy to, Gerry. Yes, I'll start with we -- as you know, we don't put forward a lot of forward-looking items like that. So while we can't guarantee anything, in the past when we've made outlook statements about where we think the margin would be in others, I think we've hopefully either consistently met it or under-promised and over-delivered. So I think as far as the risk of being getting pushed back out, I think that's low. Our margin over the last 12 months has expanded 230 basis points, and over the last 2 years, has expanded about 540 basis points. The -- what's going to impact it and the timing of it is really timing of deployment. I mean, when we talk about our AUM not-yet-earning fees, which -- meaning if we continue to grow this quarter with all of our capital raising, when we put that capital to work and the market backdrop for doing so is going to bring those management fees online. \n Gerry, I know you've heard us talk about in the past, it's really the life cycle of our business is the cost related to that capital are already embedded in the firm today in our investment teams, our capital raising teams, our non-investment functions. So we are operating with those expenses leading in front of that revenue coming online. And as a result, when that revenue comes online, it comes in at a much higher-margin than we operate at. So it really is going to be a function of that. But when we look at the amount of AUM not-yet-earning fees, the funds that's related to and how, frankly, just a continued expense discipline and trajectory of the business, I felt 40% with -- as a run rate within 3 years was definitely achievable, and it may happen, well, sooner. Yes. Look, that's going to be, again, a growing area. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we saw Ares SSG's in there, Aspida is going to be in there. So it's -- I would -- I think it would be challenging to try and focus too much on the margin of that business because that business is going to have different themes going into it. And as segments evolve and grow, something will probably -- I expect over time, will grow out of that segment to become their own segments in the future. So I know you're looking for some modeling direction on it. That's, I think, challenging. \n What I would say is -- by the way, when you look at the margin, I would highlight that we're reporting that segment consistent with our others. So a portion of the costs that relate to what we would call more corporate activities of themes of that segment are in the Operations Management Group segment. So I think that's in the Appendix of our earnings presentation. So you'll see some of that there. So this is more -- this is definitely an apples-to-apples comparison to our other business lines. But look, I think once after we have F&G reclosed, it'd be a little easier to look at it with a couple of themes that -- you'll start to see more of a run rate around it. Good question. I'd say about $2 million of G&A this quarter was related to that. So I think I had said last quarter, I kind of thought we would -- G&A would probably be, prior to including SSG, in the low 40s, so we're back $2 million off, it's $41.8 million. This quarter, we did have some nonrecurring expenses related to some of the capital raising, as you could appreciate, when you're raising a lot of money, timing of just book expenses related to work around that, including a lot of professional fees and restructuring costs will be a little more volatile. But G&A, to me, felt a little elevated this quarter, again, a function of just adding SSG and just all the capital raising. Good reason for it, frankly. It's going to flow into the segment."

            "name": "Michael Arougheti",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Carl, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope you're all healthy, and I wish you well. Despite the broad effects of the COVID crisis, we continue to execute well across all of our core functional areas with record-setting third quarter results. Our third quarter saw a year-over-year growth of 24% in our assets under management, driven by a record quarter of fundraising; 23% growth in our fee-related earnings; and nearly 50% growth in our realized income, as we monetize some investments in a strengthening equity market. We also continue to see the benefits of scale as we reported our highest FRE margins since our IPO. I'm also pleased to say that our fund performance was generally strong against the backdrop of an improving economy and favorable technicals in the liquid markets. Going forward, we continue to believe that our business is well-positioned to grow fee-related earnings by at least 15% per year in the years ahead.\n During the third quarter, our deployment was a little more measured compared to previous periods, as market transaction activity was slower and in transition. During the third quarter, we invested $3.9 billion from our drawdown funds versus $4.7 billion in the second quarter, with a continued focus on providing scaled flexible solutions to private companies, particularly in our global direct lending, special opportunities and alternative credit strategies. We are starting to see a significant pickup in M&A transaction activity in both North America and Europe, which we expect will create a healthy backdrop for both deployment and monetization. We're also seeing some interesting opportunities for undervalued assets in certain sectors within the public markets such as real estate, where there's been considerable volatility. For example, we recently made a convertible preferred investment in a Zurich-based publicly traded residential property owner with attractive German assets. We believe significant underlying value exists in this stable asset class in a core European market. Also, just last week, we announced that we're partnering with a specialized asset manager and a take-private of a public single-family rental company where we see an opportunity for value creation. This last deal is a perfect example of how we're collaborating more actively across our platform and leveraging our scale, our deal flow and unique market information to navigate the current environment. In this specific situation, funds managed by both our real estate equity and alternative credit strategies collaborated to bring a flexible and scaled solution to this company. This was a natural fit for our real estate strategy, given our leadership's experience in the asset class, and it also fits well with our alternative credit strategy, which looks for diversified pools of assets with strong contractual cash flow.  \n As another example, our special opportunity strategy recently partnered with our direct lending team to commit to a first-lien rescue capital facility to a global leader in the transportation industry.  \n Now turning to fundraising. The case for investing alternatives continues to be very compelling. Investors remain frustrated with low interest rates and the dual challenges of high valuations and volatility in the traded markets. In addition, the long-term trend of investors consolidating their relationships among fewer trusted managers with a broad product offering is ongoing. We continue to expand our wallet share with our clients, and we believe that we have a long runway for growth as they increase both their alternative allocations and their LP fund commitments across our platform. We continue to see evidence of this in the attractive re-ups into existing strategies, coupled with a desire to commit new capital across multiple other area strategies.\n The third quarter was our largest fundraising quarter ever, with $12.7 billion of organic gross capital raised, which puts us at more than $28 billion for the first 9 months. Year-to-date, we've raised capital directly from over 250 institutional investors, including approximately 150 existing Ares investors and 100 new to our platform. The existing investors accounted for 81% of the capital raised, which we believe is a testament to our consistent and strong performance and the deep relationships that we've built with our investors over the last 20-plus years.  \n Specific to our third quarter fundraising, approximately $8.2 billion, or more than EUR 7 billion, was raised from the initial closings for our fifth flagship European direct lending fund that was launched just 5 months ago in May. We're already nearly 10% above our previous fund size, and we're well on our way to hitting our target for LP commitments of EUR 9 billion. Once finished, we expect that this will be the largest ever European direct lending fund, which reflects our market leadership in this attractive and growing segment. To date, 89 investors have committed, including 65 existing investors and 24 new investors. And of note, 8 investors committed EUR 250 million or more to the fund.  \n During the third quarter, we also continued to make progress with additional fund closings totaling approximately $3 billion across our other credit strategies, including alternative credit, liquid credit and U.S. direct lending. Of note, post-quarter end, our alternative credit flagship fund reached its original target of $2 billion. Given the considerable investor momentum and strong investment pipeline, we're planning for additional closings in the coming months before concluding the fundraise. Our alternative credit strategy has increased its AUM by more than 50% in the last 6 quarters, and remains a significant future growth opportunity for us.\n Our sixth flagship corporate PE fund has closed on commitments of $3.7 billion to date. We expect to hold another closing by year-end and plan to hold the final closing in the first half of 2021. We've initiated toehold investments in the fund. And as we sit here today, we have a strong pipeline of both traditional and distressed opportunities. We also had initial closings of $235 million in our climate infrastructure fund that focuses on the energy market transition and additional inflows to Ares SSG's senior secured direct lending fund, which is now approaching $1 billion in commitments.  \n Our fundraising momentum is continuing into the fourth quarter with a significant forward pipeline. If folks recall, we shared on our last quarterly call that we were focused on surpassing $30 billion in gross fundraising commitments for the year. Based on incremental closings in October, we've already achieved that goal, and we believe that there's an opportunity to meet or exceed our record fundraising year of $36 billion that we saw in 2018. Looking forward, we currently have over a dozen commingled fundraises that either are in the market or expected to be launched in the next 12 months. And collectively, these funds are targeting equity capital commitments of more than $25 billion incremental to the amounts that we have closed through the end of the third quarter.\n Outside of these commingled funds, our fundraising efforts will certainly continue with our managed accounts and strategic partnerships, public funds, other commingled funds, new funds and various closed-end vehicles, all of which traditionally account for a significant amount of our annual capital raised. We saw positive fund performance gains across our significant funds in Q3. The performance was led by strong returns in our corporate private equity and special opportunity strategies, which generated quarterly gross returns between 6% and 9%. Our European direct lending and liquid credit composites also generated gross returns ranging between 2.7% and 4.5%. Our U.S. flagship direct lending fund, Ares Capital Corporation, continued to see improved performance with a third quarter net return of 6.5%. Our real estate equity composites also generated positive quarterly returns ranging from approximately 2% to 6%.  \n From a monetization perspective, during the third quarter, we took advantage of the strengthening equity markets, and we generated realized income from the final sale of our Floor & Decor position in ACOF III. In addition, we sold a minority position in ACOF IV portfolio company, the AZEK company, which completed an IPO earlier in the year. We're so happy to see both companies prospering in the public markets. And as the private market backdrop is now improving and equity markets continue to be strong, we'll continue to be opportunistic on the monetization front.  \n So lastly, before I turn the call over to Mike, I want to provide a brief update on our insurance initiatives through our Ares Insurance Solutions platform. Last month, we announced that our subsidiary, Aspida, is acquiring the reinsurance subsidiary of FGL Holdings, and that it entered into a strategic partnership with FGL Holdings for a flow reinsurance agreement. Once closed, we believe this platform will accelerate our plans to grow Aspida, both organically through additional reinsurance transactions, and through possible acquisitions. Our growth plans remain the same, and we continue to expect to support this Ares-sponsored insurance and annuity platform largely with third-party capital. Of note, we continue to enhance our leadership team within Ares Insurance Solutions as we just added Raj Krishnan, the former CIO of F&G, as our CIO for Ares Insurance Solutions.  \n And now I'll turn the call over to Mike McFerran for his remarks on our business positioning and financial results. Mike? Great. Thanks, Mike. We have long said that Ares is one of those unique and differentiated \"all-weather\" businesses. It's a business that can perform in various market environments and has outperformed in difficult markets. Our business isn't just demonstrating great durability and resilience in the current market backdrop, but we're also experiencing strong forward momentum. This is most evident from our record financial results and our capital raising success. \n Our cycle-tested approach, the breadth of our capabilities and our competitive advantages are all serving us well during these challenging markets, and we see this in our fund level performance and the differentiated deal flow we originate. I think our capital raising underscores the diversification of our business. We're able to not only grow and scale our comparatively mature businesses, like PE and direct lending, but we can now leverage our strength to scale some of our comparatively more recent businesses like special opportunities and alternative credit. And lastly, our ability to execute on new strategic initiatives, organic and inorganic, is a solid reminder that we're a consolidator in a growing market and that we have multiple avenues for continued long-term growth. As Mike mentioned, we're fortunate to be well-capitalized to execute on these exciting growth opportunities.\n With all that said, I want to conclude by expressing just how impressed and proud I am of the grit and the hard work and the dedication that our team is demonstrating and how grateful I am for all that they're doing to deliver for all of our stakeholders in these challenging times. We also deeply appreciate all of our investors' continuing support for our company, and we thank all of you for your time today. And with that, operator, I think we're ready to open up the line for questions. Sure. There's a lot in there, so I'll try to hit most of it. And then if you have a follow-up, we can drill down. Anytime we go through a crisis of the depth and magnitude like the one that we're going through now, we always see market share consolidation. And as we've talked about in past quarters, there is an overarching secular trend in alternatives for the larger platforms getting larger. And we've long believed that, unlike in the liquid markets, where size can sometimes hurt performance, in alternatives, at least based on the way that we go about the business, we have found that the larger we get, the more we can invest in competitive advantages and the better our performance is. So I think this crisis is no different in that respect than in past crises. And how we consolidate that share takes many forms. \n So to your point, we out-deploy, because we have scaled capital and flexible capital to pivot as the market develops. So you'll see that in our deployment in the first 9 months of the year, where we were much more active in the liquid markets through the first 4 or 5 months of the year, pivoted actively into the private markets across the platform through the middle of the year on rescue loans, and now are pivoting yet again into the regular way buyout market as the economy starts to heal and capital comes off the sidelines. \n So I think in order to succeed through the cycle, the way that we have, you have to be able to play each and every opportunity that gets put in front of you, and you have to have the capital and the people to execute well. So yes, those that went into the crisis with weaker portfolios, weaker balance sheets, less capability, I think, are experiencing this crisis much differently than we and some of our larger peers are. I also think that that's showing up in the fundraising. We hear anecdotally that the smaller single-asset managers are actually having a very challenging time raising capital in the work-from-home environment, juxtapose that with us and the larger peers who I think are all enjoying very significant success across multiple products. \n And then lastly, I think with regard to deployment picking up, we've often talked with all of you about the 3 phases of the cycle, one being that first phase, where the liquid markets were not functioning and we were active playing liquid distress; the second phase being kind of where we are now, which is largely rescue capital opportunities and taking advantage of people's need for liquidity in both, what I would call, high-quality assets with bad balance sheets or high-quality balance sheets in decent-quality asset pools, and that's been a lot of what we've been doing through the middle of the year. \n And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the deployment was probably slower in Q3, just as a result of the markets were normalizing. And now, as we head into the end of the year, I think the combination of people coming off the sidelines with a lot of pent-up demand for deployment, some prospect for economic recovery, albeit uneven, some tax-driven selling on the part of asset owners. And I think a view that low rates are going to support asset prices for a longer time. We are seeing very, very significant pickup in deployment across the platform. And when we get into that phase of the cycle, as we talked about, that's kind of the sweet spot, because you still have people who are poorly capitalized. So the distressed opportunity does not go away, but you now have the opportunity to pick and choose between regular way flow for non-COVID-impacted assets and companies, relative to the more COVID-impacted. So we're pretty optimistic about deployment and monetization going into the end of the year and into -- early into 2021. Sure. We have Matt and Bennett on. Why don't we -- we'll let them handle that. Sure. So I would characterize it as competitive but organized competition in the sense that Ares and those that look like us are all seeing the same long-term trend, which is the insurance market is struggling with low interest rates for longer. And long duration liabilities with the inability to generate asset returns to meet the needs of that portfolio. So if you just think about the evolution of that dynamic, not surprisingly, prior to folks like us aligning more strategically with insurance company platforms, we were managing and continue to manage a significant amount of capital on behalf of insurance company clients, because the name of the game is to transition to being just a liability-oriented manager and start to figure out how you can actually generate differentiated asset performance and excess return. \n And I expect that, that trend is here to stay, will continue and will accelerate. It is a very large market. I think there's plenty of room for all of us to continue to build our insurance businesses alongside our core business. But what I would comment on is actually expanding the playing field, if you will, for what it means to be an alternative fixed income manager. So a lot of the product that makes sense for the insurance company clients or the captive insurers is higher up the balance sheet, what I would call, fixed income, traditional fixed income alternatives or high-grade fixed income alternatives as opposed to some of the historically traditional private credit assets. So in many respects, it's expanded the opportunity set for folks like us. \n And the competition, like I said, it's consistent. So those of us who have a commitment to building the insurance business are building it, but we have not seen a lot of new entrants coming in because, again, I think you need differentiated sourcing at scale, right? And you need the access to the capital. And so I think the people who are in the market are the ones that are going to continue to scale. Yes. So I'm glad you bring up middle market kind of as a concept to think about how the crisis is playing out, because Ares is squarely a middle-market firm. But the definition of middle market obviously continues to expand. There's probably no better place to look than ARCC and some of the comments that Kipp and the team made yesterday around average issuer size now in excess of $100 million of EBITDA and some of the return opportunities that we're seeing there relative to smaller companies. So I believe smaller companies obviously have fewer levers to pull in navigating the crisis. They have less consistent access to liquidity, maybe less durable business models or less institutional-quality opportunities for exit. And so we would expect to see more stress in the lower end of the market than the upper end. I think, fortunately, most of our deployment is in the upper end of the market, and so you can see how that's benefited performance of the in-place book. As we continue to get more clarity around the forward earnings picture, yes, there should be an opportunity for us, whether it's through our special opportunities business, alternative credit or direct lending to go in and be a liquidity provider to those companies and those asset owners. I will tell you right now, that's not where we're seeing the best relevant value, because we're putting money to work actually at higher rates of return and higher-quality assets given the capital inefficiency. There's just a lot of people who can write a check into a smaller company situation relative to people who have our capital scale, and that's actually creating a little bit of a perversion in terms of the risk-adjusted return opportunity down market. But if history is any indicator, clearly, that should present itself to us both in terms of buying portfolios, but also coming in with rescue loans to individual assets and individual companies. Yes, it's interesting. And one of the reasons why we wanted to build-out in Asia, as we've talked about, is clearly, that's where a significant amount of global GDP growth is going to come over the next 20 years. But we also want to have a window into other parts of the world as -- despite the current administration's view, as the economy globalizes, we want to be global. It is an interesting juxtaposition, because those economies are in a different phase in terms of the recovery, and so their opportunity set is developing along a slightly different trajectory. But as I mentioned earlier, our Asian vehicles have the ability to invest flexibly through the cycle the same way that our European and U.S. do. So similar to the path that we've been on, where they were active in the liquid markets, earlier in the crisis, and now we're starting to pivot more towards regular way investing, they're mirroring that. Deployment has been very strong, particularly in our special situation strategies there. And as I mentioned, we're in the market now fundraising for our third senior direct lending fund, and that's already, as I mentioned, close to $1 billion on a $1.2 billion cover having been launched in COVID. So far, so good. Obviously, it's early, but the value proposition that we underwrote both in terms of scale, window into the world and return generation is all playing out as we had hoped. Sure. It's a great question. And we've, I think, been pretty transparent that we believe that there is a long-term, and I would emphasize long-term trend of convergence in asset management between retail and institutional as well as traditional and alternative. And so if I look forward 10-plus years, I think those lines will continue to blur as these business models continue to evolve and move towards scale. \n I think the challenge we have, candidly, is when you look at the fundamentals in our business, we've been growing 15% to 25% per year across every functional area and every financial metric. We have secular tailwinds in terms of the appetite for our assets. The structure of our business doesn't have the mark-to-market volatility, the risk of outflows or the risk of fee compression that you see in the traditional space and so on and so forth. So it's hard, frankly, for us to want to lead into that convergence trend, because we have such wind at our back, continuing to execute on our playbook in alternatives that to divert our attention towards business models that are struggling for growth, struggling for margin expansion, struggling for performance. It's hard to see the industrial logic in that. But we do have an eye on what is a long-term vision for the future, where there will be great asset managers and not great asset managers globally. And I think we have to be open to new definitions of what it means to be alternative or what it means to be traditional. \n In the meantime, as you've seen, we will continue to be active on the acquisition front, where we can add new capability, new distribution, new geographies that we think will accelerate our growth into the favorable backdrop. As we've talked about before though, the bar for acquisitions is getting higher because as we've demonstrated with things like special opportunities or alternative credit, we're now at a size and capability where we can bring teams onto the platform, surround them with capital and structure and actually grow pretty sizable businesses organically in a way that's just much more accretive to long-term value creation than buying. So while we look at all things, the bar, while it's always been high, I think, is getting higher, just given our ability to organically grow some of these step-out strategies. Yes. I think it's both. We've talked about before, one of the benefits of our approach is that we have not been encumbered by any large legacy balance sheet exposures and the way that we're approaching the build of our insurance platform. So I think if we were sitting on a large legacy book and we had to deal with the in-force liabilities in this rate environment, we may feel differently. But here's what we know. With low rates, everybody is going to be struggling to generate the asset returns that they need to support their actuarial models. And that's true whether you're a pension fund or insurance company or an individual. And so low rates in and of themselves, I think, are going to continue to drive people to need to think about savings, but think about how they generate return through the retirement. So I think the whole retirement market, annuities at the top of the list, is going to continue to grow. At the end of the day, the way that we and others are [Audio Gap] this business is it's a spread-lending business. And so as long as we can continue to use our differentiated origination and structuring to generate excess spread, then it will continue to be a growth vehicle for us. And I'm pretty confident that's the world that we're going to be living in. Sure. So those who have known us a long time, Adam, have always heard us talk about what we call the power of the platform and collaborative culture. And I know a lot of people talk about similar approaches. I actually think that it's harder to execute on than many people appreciate. I think many businesses have looked like ours that didn't grow up with the sense of partnership and collaboration that we have, can get siloed and not have aligned incentives, and that can create some constraints to the type of active collaboration that we are highlighting in the prepared remarks. That is core to who we are and how we invest in any environment. So as an example, if you harken back a couple of quarters, when we did a unitranche for a company called Ardonagh, which was the largest European unitranche ever recorded at close to $2 billion, that was actually done as a collaboration between our U.S. direct lending team and our European direct lending team. \n So that's a regular part of the business. And the reason that, that happens is a lot of these situations are going to force -- they're forcing mechanisms for these teams to come together, either there's a need for capital scale or it's a hybrid, a net lease transaction where you want to bring credit expertise together with real estate expertise or, in the case of this unitranche, you have a a U.S. sponsor looking at a European asset. So the market is kind of pushing us into that active collaboration. \n When you get into a crisis like the one we're in now, all of those catalysts for collaboration just get amplified, because there's so many unique situations that have structural challenges in them where, if we can bring capital scale, capital flexibility, unique information, insights, relationships, et cetera, it's better for everybody. So I would say, now more than ever, we're collaborating now more than we ever have, but it's not unique just to be in the middle of a crisis. It's core to how we manage the business and core to the culture in terms of how people think about partnership here. Yes. So I don't want to give a -- I don't want to give away some trade secrets here. So I'll just highlight, in our prepared remarks, we talked about funds that are kind of in the queue over the next 12 months that we think will generate $25 billion-plus of incremental equity capital commitments in excess of what we had raised through the end of the quarter. Embedded in that are a number of step-out strategies, and those are going to be in adjacent markets. So for example, leveraging our direct lending expertise into specific industries. It may be leveraging our healthcare expertise in private equity into other parts of the healthcare market and ecosystem. So I don't want to be evasive, but there's so many interesting things that we're incubating. I'd rather wait till they're birthed and we have something to talk about and then happy to drill down on it. But what you're highlighting is key to how we're driving the type of growth rate that we are and special opportunities is a great example. Alternative credit is another one, where, obviously, we've been able to grow that asset base by 50% over the last 1.5 years organically by bringing new folks and new capital solutions onto the platform. So we have a number of those types of situations that are very far along. And I think, over the next couple of quarters, you'll get some good exposure to what those are. Yes. So we are in the market, as we mentioned, and we had a first close in the quarter on our infrastructure strategy, which has now been, for the most part, fully repositioned into what we call climate infrastructure. And that team, both on the credit and equity side is now 100% focused on investing money into the energy transition, and that's both renewable infrastructure, sustainable infrastructure and renewable technology. That is where the market is going, that is where the opportunity for investment will be. It's also consistent with where we stand from an ESG-focused standpoint, I think where our investors stand as well. The deployment there has been very exciting, and it ranges the entire waterfront of the energy transition from renewable power generation to technology around vehicle electrification battery storage, residential, solar and things like that. So it really runs the gamut. \n I think a blue wave would be a massive catalyst for that business, given the way that we've positioned the team and the capital there. The current administration has actually been favorable for renewables despite the fact that I think those folks probably feel like they're more heavily supportive with the fossil fuel industry. We've actually seen the business thrive just because there's so much happening at the state and local level and at the consumer preference level that's kind of pulling that change through as well. But yes, if we have a blue wave and a big renewable energy infrastructure bill, that's going to unlock a pretty significant opportunity set for us. \n And in terms of where it is -- yes -- and you said where it could go, obviously, the range of what I would call sustainable infrastructure is broader than just wind and solar. So I think you would see us continue to broaden out there. And then geographically, right now, we've been limiting our investment in the U.S. market, but I would expect to see us continue to look to other geographies as that business expands as well. No, we appreciate everybody spending time with us. We hope everybody stays safe and well. And we look forward to speaking with everybody next quarter. And I also do want to congratulate my L.A. colleagues on the Dodger win, as a disgruntled Yankee fan, tough to see, but in the spirit of partnership, I'm happy for all of you. So congratulations, and we'll talk to everybody next quarter. Thanks."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Wednesday, August 5, 2020. I would now like to turn the conference over to Carl Drake, Head of Public Company Investor Relations for Ares Management. Please go ahead, sir.\nCarl Drake: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for our second quarter 2020 conference call. I\u2019m joined today by Michael Arougheti, our Chief Executive Officer; and Michael McFerran, our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, David Kaplan, Co-Chairman of our Private Equity Group; Kipp deVeer, Head of our Credit Group; and Matt Cwiertnia, co-Head of our Private Equity Group, will be available for the question-and-answer session. Before we begin, I want to remind you that comments made during this call contain forward-looking statements and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those identified in our risk factors in our SEC filings. Our actual results could differ materially, and we undertake no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Please also note that past performance is not a guarantee of future results. During this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which should not be considered in isolation from or a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, please note that our management fees include ARCC Part I fee. Please refer to our second quarter earnings presentation available on the Investor Resources section of our website for reconciliations of the measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Please note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Ares Fund. This morning, we announced that we declared our third quarter common dividend of $0.40 per share, representing an increase of 25% of our dividend for the same quarter last year. The dividend will be paid on September 30, 2020, to holders of record on September 16, 2020. We also declared our quarterly preferred dividend of $0.4375 per Series A preferred share, which is payable on September 30, 2020, to holders of record on September 15. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Michael Arougheti, who will start with some quarterly financial and business highlights.\nMichael Arougheti: Great. Thanks, Carl, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope everyone is healthy and safe, and I wish you and your families well. So now with the full quarter of the impact of the COVID pandemic behind us, we\u2019re pleased that our results continue to be strong, and we couldn\u2019t be more proud of how our employees have adapted to the current challenges. Our consistent revenue and earnings growth reflect our resilient management fee-centric business model and our steady growth in clients and AUM in the global market for alternative investments. Our second quarter was our 13th consecutive quarter of sequential fee-related earnings growth with FRE of $97 million, an increase of 26% from the same period last year. In addition to reporting record FRE, our second quarter also set new records for most of our other key metrics, including management fees, AUM and fee-paying AUM. Our second quarter FRE margins reached a post-IPO high, as we continue to gain efficiencies of scale and experience slower operating expense growth. The second quarter was one of our best fundraising quarters ever, with more than $9 billion raised, including approximately $5 billion from funds in our private equity group, and our momentum across the platform is continuing into the second half of the year. Our strong fundraising has set us up well for future growth in management fees and earnings, which could be seen by the sharp increase in our available capital and shadow AUM, as Mike McFerran will discuss in a little bit. From a market perspective, the traded equity and debt markets have been very volatile in the first half of the year, with a quick dramatic sell-off in March, followed by a historic rally in the second quarter as fiscal and monetary stimulus poured in with unprecedented speed and scope. In the first quarter, we invested aggressively into the public traded markets during the dislocation. And in the second quarter, as markets rebounded, we pivoted more toward private investing with an emphasis on rescue capital and assisting larger companies with flexible capital solutions. While actions and policies by the federal government and the Fed have clearly helped provide interim support to the economy and markets broadly during this period, we do think that we\u2019re still in the early days of the economy feeling the broader knock-on effects from this crisis. We continue to believe that tradable market technicals are disconnected from economic fundamentals, and we\u2019re planning for a slow and uneven recovery over the next few years. We believe investment opportunities with outsized returns will be available to those of us with patience, capital and differentiated capabilities. And as we\u2019ve talked about before, and we\u2019ll do more so on our call today, we believe that we\u2019re well positioned to take advantage of this dynamic. There are two strong long-term trends that have benefited our business for many years and have only accelerated with the pandemic. First, on the investing front, the benefits of our scaled self-origination capabilities and our flexible approach have become even more valuable in volatile markets, as investment opportunities pivot between public and private markets. Our coverage and significant relationship network enable us to source attractive opportunities, uncover relative value and take advantage of inconsistent market competition, particularly for larger companies. So while transaction activity today is generally slower, the competitive environment has significantly improved, with many competitors tending to their existing portfolios, reducing workforces or unable to access attractive forms of new capital and liquidity. Many banks have retrenched in both North America and Europe, making it difficult for certain companies and assets to attract capital. This has resulted in opportunities for scaled players, like Ares, to step in where the traded markets are not available or are not as attractive. As an example, in the second quarter, we led the largest unitranche private credit financing ever completed, a nearly GBP two billion private financing for a leading insurance brokerage company in the U.K. This transaction is a great example of what we\u2019re capable of executing for our clients and why many of them turn to private capital for enhanced flexibility and relationship purposes. In this case, we had both U.K. and U.S. relationships with the company sponsors, and we were able to structure a bespoke solution that met the company\u2019s growth needs. As a result, we were able to invest a substantial amount of capital across both our U.S. and European direct lending funds. Our bias toward structuring our funds to be as flexible as possible is an even greater advantage in today\u2019s market environment. As an example, during the second quarter, our alternative credit team led a $400 million transaction for a publicly traded mortgage REIT. We were able to structure an asset-oriented solution, which included a term loan with warrants that enabled the REIT to short its financing and go on offense with respect to new investments and potential acquisitions. Also of note, our special opportunities team sourced a $400 million investment solution for another public company, which operates in the outdoor advertising sector in the form of a convertible preferred. Our teams are focused on helping companies strengthen their financial foundations and enable them to go on offense and consolidate market share. Overall, during the second quarter, we deployed $4.7 billion in our drawdown funds, compared to $4.1 billion from the same period a year ago, primarily in global direct lending, alternative credit and our special opportunity strategies. The second major theme is that investors are continuing to consolidate their relationships and place more of their wallet share with trusted larger scale alternative managers with broad product sets. In this environment, it\u2019s been difficult for investors to diligence new managers, which is leading investors to commit more capital with known relationships. The case for investing in alternatives has also been strengthened given the heightened market volatility in the traded sectors at near 0 interest rates. These factors can all be seen in our strong fundraising statistics year-to-date and our strong pipeline. For the first half of the year, we have now raised $15.7 billion organically, excluding the $2.7 billion in AUM from the Denali purchase in Q1, which now puts us on track for one of our best fundraising years ever. This is even more impressive since none of our large corporate direct lending commingled funds held an LP closing in the first half of the year. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve raised capital directly from 139 institutional investors, including 83 existing Ares investors and 56 new to our platform. The existing investors accounted for 78% of the capital raised, which we believe is a testament to our consistent and strong performance and the deep relationships that we\u2019ve built with many of them over time. Specific to our second quarter fundraising, approximately $5 billion was raised by funds in our Private Equity Group. Our special opportunities fund closed on $1.5 billion during the second quarter, concluding its fundraise at $3.5 billion, well in excess of our $2 billion target. Our sixth flagship corporate private equity fund, which held its first closing during the second quarter, closed at approximately $3.5 billion with 90% coming from existing investors This $7 billion of capital raised by our PE group means that we\u2019re well on our way toward our goal of having at least $10 billion between the two funds to target investments in this attractive environment for stressed and distressed investing as well as for traditional private equity transactions. We also raised $3.9 billion across our credit strategies, which included commitments to public vehicles, new commitments to managed accounts and funds and additional closings on our flagship commingled alternative credit fund. Our alternative credit fund now stand at $1.6 billion toward its $2 billion target, and we continue to expect to meet or exceed our $2 billion target by the end of the year. We also saw about $400 million of additional commitments to our real estate funds, where performance has been consistently strong. Our fundraising momentum is continuing, and our entire organization is highly focused on surpassing at least $30 billion of capital commitments this year, which we\u2019ve only done once before in 2018. We currently have at least nine commingled fundraises, either in the market or to be launched in the next six to nine months, including our four largest private commingled successor funds. These nine funds showcase the breadth of our offering and, together, represent at least $25 billion of incremental equity capital commitments targeted to be raised through the end of this year and into early 2021. They include our fifth European direct lending fund, our sixth corporate private equity fund, our second U.S. junior capital direct lending fund, our second U.S. senior direct lending fund, our alternative credit fund, two real estate PE funds, the third Asian secured lending fund from our new Ares SSG colleagues and our climate infrastructure fund. We launched our fifth European direct lending fund in May, and it\u2019s targeted to be the largest fund in our firm\u2019s history. We\u2019ve seen strong client interest so far, and we expect a significant first close in the coming weeks. In addition, outside of these highlighted funds, our fundraising efforts will certainly continue with our managed accounts and strategic partnerships, our public funds, other commingled funds and close-end vehicles, all of which traditionally account for a sizable amount of our annual capital raised. We\u2019re happy to see that our investors are highly engaged. They\u2019ve ironed out their work-from-home investment processes, and they recognize the attractive investment opportunities that can arise during periods of significant volatility. By expanding our wallet share with our clients, which include leading pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, private banks and others, we believe that we have a long runway for growth as our clients further expand into alternatives, and we have the opportunity to gain share from manager consolidation. In addition, our leading credit, private equity and real estate franchises continue to attract a steady stream of new investors, and we believe this will only be strengthened with over 115 institutional investors being onboarded with the closing of the SSG Capital transaction, of which approximately 90 are new to Ares. We also continue to see an attractive rate of reups into larger existing strategies and a desire to commit new capital into other Ares strategies. Turning to a few other highlights in the quarter. We saw a nice snapback in performance across most of our funds in Q2. The performance was led by our most liquid credit strategies, which rebounded about 9% or more, and both our loan and high-yield strategies continue to outperform their respective benchmarks on a year-to-date basis. Our European direct lending composite and significant U.S. direct lending fund, Ares Capital, which were both less volatile in the first quarter compared to our liquid funds, returned around 2% and 4%, respectively, for the second quarter. Our European and U.S. real estate equity fund composites, which have limited exposure to hospitality and retail properties, continued their resilient performance with gross returns of more than 3% for the second quarter. Our corporate private equity fund composite rebounded nearly 5% driven by strong performance in our public positions, which helped us recapture most of the decline from the first quarter. Our private equity composite performance would have been up more than 20% for the quarter, excluding energy. Given investor sentiment, expected challenges in the energy industry and volatility, we, like certain other managers, are excluding energy from our latest corporate private equity fund. These activities will be completed outside of our sixth fund and in our dedicated energy funds going forward. From a monetization perspective, the markets continue to be slow for most regular way buyout investing, and realizations are likely to remain slow in the near term. On the positive side, transaction activity is in the early stages of recovery, which bodes well for perhaps late 2020 or 2021. The public equity markets have rebounded sharply, creating potential monetization opportunities and capital access for certain non-COVID-impacted sectors. During the second quarter, we took advantage of the market uptick and generated realized income from the sale of a portion of our Floor & Decor position in ACOF III. In addition, one of our portfolio companies in ACOF IV, the AZEK Co., went public through a highly successful IPO in the industrial sector. By the end of the second quarter, AZEK had generated an additional unrealized gain of approximately $1 billion relative to the first quarter. Also within private equity, we recently completed the sale of our infrastructure and power team\u2019s investment in Aviator Wind, the largest single-phased, single-site wind power project in the U.S. This project, which includes power purchasing agreements with two of the 50 largest companies in the U.S., highlights the growing demand for renewable energy in corporate America. And so lastly, before I turn the call over to Mike, I want to provide a brief update on our SSG Capital transaction, which closed in July. We said before we believe the transaction further expands our global leadership position in private credit and enhances our ability to expand our investment capabilities across a strategic and high-growth region. For the past decade, SSG has established itself as one of the leading secured lending and special opportunities investors across the Pan-Asian region and is widely recognized by institutional investors and the corporate communities that they target. The team\u2019s experience, long tenure and track record are particularly valuable in the current market environment. Like other parts of the platform, SSG continues to successfully expand its capital base with the recent closing of approximately $800 million on its latest secured lending fund, bringing its AUM as of June 30 to $6.9 billion. Going forward, we expect Ares SSG will capitalize on the growth opportunity using its broad Pan-Asian footprint and seek to replicate the success that we\u2019ve achieved scaling and diversifying our business across North America and Europe. In addition, our new strategic partnership with SMBC further expands our relationships and connectivity in the region, which we expect will only bolster our opportunities. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike McFerran for his remarks on our business positioning and the quarter\u2019s financial results. Mike?\nMike McFerran: Thank you, Mike. Hello, everyone. I hope you and your families are safe and well. I will begin with some highlights on the quarter and then provide a more in-depth review of our results and current financial position. The second quarter was our 13th consecutive quarter of sequential FRE growth. The steady growth is driven by our management fee-centric business model, which drove 84% of our realized income in the second quarter. Our FRE margin stands at over 34%, as we continue to scale and improve margins. The over $9 billion of gross fundraising helped assets under management and fee-paying AUM reach new highs, which increased 11.5% and 18%, respectively, over the last 12 months, and this fundraising drove our shadow AUM to $27.8 billion. During the quarter, we saw a fairly broad-based recovery in the performance of our significant funds across credit, private equity and real estate. We also realized a portion of our position in Floor & Decor, a highly successful publicly held position in our Private Equity Group, which supported our realized income this quarter, despite the muted overall realization environment. Now let me take you through the results in further detail. Fee-related earnings for the quarter totaled $97 million, an increase of 26% from the second quarter of 2019. Year-to-date, our fee-related earnings of $190 million was up 28% from the same period last year and highlights our continued growth trajectory, even through times of significant volatility. Fee-related earnings growth was driven by 13% management fee growth from the prior year period as well as a decrease in general and administrative expenses, which declined over $5 million from the second quarter of 2019 in part due to continued travel restrictions. As we grow our AUM and fee-paying AUM through fundraising and deployment across several new strategies, our FRE margin has continued to expand. FRE margins were 34% in the quarter and for the first half of 2020 compared to 30.5% for the first half of 2019. Realized income for the quarter totaled $115.2 million, which represents an increase of $20.9 million or 22% as compared to the second quarter of 2019. After-tax realized income per share of Class A common stock, net of preferred stock distributions, was $0.39 for the second quarter, an increase of 22% from the second quarter of 2019. Next I\u2019d like to spend some time on our AUM and related metrics. Our AUM as of June 30 totaled $158.4 billion compared to $142.1 billion last year, an increase of 11.5% year-over-year. AUM was driven by additional gross commitments across our fund strategies, with near record inflows in the quarter, as well as significant market appreciation, which received some of the depreciation we saw in Q1. Our gross new capital commitments totaled $9.1 billion in the quarter, including the first close of our sixth flagship corporate private equity fund as well as the final close for our special opportunities fund, which accounted for more than half of the fundraising for the quarter. Our fee-paying AUM increased 18% year-over-year driven by meaningful deployment in our European and U.S. direct lending strategies, special opportunities and alternative credit strategy as well as additional commitments within our liquid credit strategy. We ended the quarter with $105.5 billion of fee-paying AUM, which is represented by approximately 75% credit funds, 16% private equity funds and 9% real estate funds. Our available capital increased to a new record high of $39.2 billion driven by additional commitments from our flagship fund families, including corporate private equity, special opportunities and alternative credit strategies. We ended the quarter with $27.8 billion of AUM not yet paying fees, of which approximately $25 billion is available for future deployment, which, if deployed, corresponds to annual management fees totaling $253 million. Last, our incentive-eligible AUM increased by over $6 billion to $91.8 billion. Of this amount, $30.7 billion was uninvested at quarter end. Although the market decline caused a decline in our net accrued carry balance in the first quarter, the strong market rebound and the successful IPO of the AZEK Co. helped drive our net accrued performance income to $289 million, a 23% increase from March 31. With strong levels of shadow AUM, along with our net accrued performance income, we believe we have the building blocks in place to generate and recognize meaningful, long-term value through additional performance fees. We believe our history of investing across market cycles, combined with a wide array of flexible fund strategies, represents a significant competitive advantage as we navigate through the current and future market environment. From a portfolio perspective, we feel good about the general health and performance of the portfolio as the vast majority of our investments are at the top of the capital structure in resilient, less-cyclical businesses. Firmwide, we are overweighted in areas like healthcare, software and various services businesses and generally underweighted in more COVID-impacted sectors. I\u2019d like to take a moment to address our strong financial position and our recent long-term debt issuance. As Mike stated, we recently took advantage of the low interest rate environment and rebounding public debt markets by issuing $400 million in 10-year notes in a successful offering at 3.25%, a substantially lower rate than our existing notes. This puts our balance sheet in an excellent position and provides us with the ability to generate accretive returns on our capital for the management company. We entered the second quarter with nearly $2 billion in liquidity, with $890 million in cash on the balance sheet and no amounts drawn on our $1.065 billion corporate revolving credit facility. We have no maturities until 2024, and when subtracting all of our debt from our cash, we have nearly $250 million of cash left over. As a reminder, our outstanding $300 million of 7% perpetual preferred stock is callable as of June 2021. As we get closer, we will evaluate calling and retiring this equity, as it is comparatively expensive. If we elect to do so, we expect it would be meaningfully accretive to our earnings. We enter the back half of 2020 extremely well capitalized, with no net debt, no near-term debt maturities and no mark-to-market balance sheet leverage. We believe our strong balance sheet and significant liquidity gives us great optionality and flexibility to be opportunistic and patient during this expected volatile period. In conclusion, we believe that our business is very well positioned in the current environment and for what lies ahead. Our management fee-centric business rooted in credit and flexible strategies, coupled with our balance sheet-light model and strong liquidity, puts us in an excellent position to drive continued growth and profitability and to be opportunistic as this market evolves. We have significant fundraising momentum with a large pipeline of flagship funds, and our investors recognize our ability to perform well during volatile and down markets. Our investment professionals are finding creative ways to make compelling investments, as the competitive landscape provides opportunity, and the collaboration across our platform has never been stronger or more valuable. Our shadow AUM puts us in an excellent position to invest well and generate attractive growth in revenues and earnings. We feel good about the health of our overall portfolio, and we have excellent portfolio management teams maximizing value, sharing best practices and generating synergies across our global portfolios. We are so impressed by the resilience and grit that our teams have demonstrated, and we are grateful for all of their incredible work to deliver yet another record quarter of results, despite all of the current challenges. We appreciate all of your continuing support for our company, and thank you for the time today. Operator, could you please open up the line for questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Robert Lee with KBW. Please go ahead.\nRobert Lee: Great. Mike, maybe starting with the fundraising that you mean including this good quarter and still pretty positive about the outlook, I\u2019m just curious, maybe specifically within PE, it had a good first close. But I mean, do you still feel, at least with ACOF, I guess it is fixed? I think previously, you\u2019ve kind of suggested, I forget the number, about 30% upsizing is kind of what you\u2019re thinking for that. Does that still seem like a reasonable objective of given the environment?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. I think it\u2019s a reasonable objective. One thing I would clarify in the prepared remarks, too, one of the things that makes us unique in terms of our approach to distressed investing is that our special opportunities/special sits capability sits in our private equity group for a lot of reasons we articulated historically in terms of the need to not just be buying distressed securities in the public markets, but to be able to leverage private market origination and portfolio management to improve those situations. So when I think about capital raising and capital deployment in private equity, I think of that whole complex, SOF plus ACOF. And when you look at the success that we had in SOF, given the positioning of that fund and the market opportunity ahead of us, as well as the momentum that we first closed on ACOF, I think our aggregate capital raising plans for that group should continue to meet, if not exceed the targets.\nRobert Lee: Okay. Great. And I know you\u2019ve talked about the success you\u2019ve had with new LPs and bringing them on board the last couple of quarters with some of the fundraising. But kind of prospectively, I mean, since, I guess, some of what you saw this quarter was kind of in-process before everything hit or has everything hit, I mean, do you sense any kind of change as you\u2019ve kind of looked further down the path in terms of the ability to get that incremental new LP? Is that kind of I assume that, but maybe not, but isn\u2019t those processes starting to slow down and maybe kind of, from here, even though you\u2019re optimistic, maybe kind of getting maybe become more dependent on existing LPs over the next couple of quarters versus bringing on that incremental new LP?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, it does. The simple answer is no. But obviously, there\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty in the world. As we talked about in the prepared remarks, I actually think, when we all went to a remote work environment, it actually benefited the larger managers who had deep embedded relationships and managers who are already in market with large fund offerings that actually take advantage of distress. So when you look at our positioning coming into 2020, we had already been actively premarketing and marketing a lot of the funds that we\u2019re raising now, and I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019ve seen continued momentum toward potentially another record fundraising year. I would have had a little bit more concern earlier in the year, but we\u2019re actually seeing a lot of the institutional investor platforms adapt their processes for remote work, and we\u2019re seeing a healthy amount of new LPs come on to the platform as well. So at least, what we\u2019re seeing today, Rob, I\u2019m not seeing any change in behavior. I\u2019d actually become more optimistic that folks are now able to diligence new products and new strategies that should benefit some of the offerings later in the year.\nRobert Lee: Okay. Great. And if I could maybe just one more quick one on SSG. Any I mean, you mentioned it is completed a fundraising. But I think you talked about potentially a new one with the first one with since being onboard. But can you maybe update us a little bit on kind of how we should think about the financial impact, I know it\u2019s fairly modest, but how we should think about that and how that may flow through the P&L.?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, happy to. So just to remind folks, SSG, as I mentioned, has about $7 billion of assets under management. As it sits today, it has two core investment offerings. One is what we refer to as special situations, which is kind of the founding strategy of the group getting back to their tenured AM. And then the second is what we refer to as secured lending, which is more akin to what we all would think of as regular way direct lending. SSG had a very meaningful close on its fifth special situations fund in the fourth quarter of last year prior to our announcement and then launched post the announcement, but pre-closing their latest secured lending fund. And that\u2019s the fund that I referred to in the prepared remarks with which had significant momentum, as you would imagine given the world that we live in. The financial impact, you\u2019ll start to see reporting next quarter now that we\u2019ve closed July one or two and likely will be reported in a separate segment, along with other strategic initiatives that we\u2019re undertaking at the management company, so you\u2019ll begin to see the financial impact. The deal is accretive given the nature of the deal that we structured and the momentum that the company has. Our long-term ambition is to see SSG grow to be not just in the credit business, but to expand its product set and its reach into the other capabilities that we have here, i.e., real estate, private equity, infrastructure, etc. So we have pretty big ambitions, and I think that we had a pretty good playbook given our historical success scaling the businesses that we have in North America and Europe. And a lot of the strategy teams that are working with SSG on that blueprint and business plan are the same folks that have actually executed on the expansion plans in other places as well.\nOperator: The next question will come from Gerry O\u2019Hara with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nGerald O\u2019Hara: Great. Perhaps one, sir, just around deployment. And if you could maybe add some context around the environment as it relates to what you mentioned in the prepared remarks with respect to still some runway before we start seeing regular-weight private equity deals return. And I guess, just trying to get a sense of what the opportunity set could be for your now record levels of available capital and as your latest vintage private equity fund starts to come online.\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. I\u2019ll give you my view, and then I\u2019ll let Matt or David give you some PE-specific commentary if they feel like it. But just to contextualize our deployment, in the second quarter of 2019, as I mentioned, we deployed about $4.1 billion in our drawdown funds. If you look at the number in Q2, that was about $4.7 million. Interestingly, we deployed about $5.5 billion in Q1 in drawdown funds, which I\u2019ll come back to. And if you were to look at the $4.7 billion, that number would grow to about $5.9 million when you include the non-drawdown funds. So deployment has been consistent. And if you remember what we talked about on the last earnings call, the way that we\u2019ve kind of simplified the framework for how we\u2019re going to invest through the crisis is, in Phase 1, which was kind of March into the first week or two of April, there was so much volatility and dislocation in the liquid markets that we were very active there, and that\u2019s why you saw a little bit of a spike in the Q1 deployment. We\u2019re now in Phase 2, which is kind of a focus on the existing portfolio, provide capital to incumbent relationships, build liquidity bridges to the extent that you can and get paid to do so and then begin to go on offense in terms of the new issue market. And some of the things that we talked about in the prepared remarks in the alternative credit, direct lending and special ops parts of our business, I think, are pretty good indicators of the types of opportunities that are coming our way. And then when we get to Phase 3, which is a little bit more market stability, a little bit more earnings visibility and normalcy in the market, that\u2019s when you see more regular weight deployment, but still very, very attractive rates of return because, typically, you\u2019re getting paid significantly higher rates of return for significantly lower risk given the change in the multiple in the leverage environment. So we\u2019re still squarely in that second phase, but I think as we\u2019re getting deeper into this health and economic crisis and a lot of the companies have built liquidity bridges in March to June based on a view that we would have a V-shaped recovery or a snap back or that the fiscal stimulus would actually support meaningful economic growth, I think, are beginning to grapple with the reality that the liquidity bridges that they\u2019ve built may not be long enough. And so the pipeline is starting to reaccelerate around being a solutions provider for some of those companies that are high-quality franchise companies or assets that just aren\u2019t that have no access to the capital the way that we are.\nGerald O\u2019Hara: Okay. That\u2019s helpful.\nMichael Arougheti: Matt, do you have any color commentary you\u2019d like to add on PE?\nMatt Cwiertnia: Sure. This is Matt Cwiertnia. So from a private equity perspective, I think we think our flexible capital mandate right now is probably as relevant and balanced as ever. We see things really both on the distressed side and on the traditional side. One thing I\u2019d point out on the distressed side is the small and medium businesses or the middle market are really struggling more than you would be led to believe if you just follow the S&P 500 or the NASDAQ. And so we are seeing a number of really private rescue capital opportunities on the distressed side because the middle market doesn\u2019t have the access to some of the government programs that the large caps do. And on the traditional side, as Mike alluded to, there are just some industries and some companies that are doing OK and have growth opportunities in front of them that can go and play offense. So I think the backlog for traditional throughout the industry and certainly for ourselves, it is growing. I think, in the second half of this year, if this stays on trend, I think you\u2019ll see more regular way private equity here before the end of the year and probably bigger in the second half than you saw in the first half.\nGerald O\u2019Hara: Okay. Helpful comments. And just perhaps one follow-up. You\u2019ve obviously been active with SSG and as well as SMBC. But Mike, could you perhaps give a sense for what the firm appetite is perhaps even capacity for additional strategic partnerships and M&A-type activity at this point in the cycle?\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. The appetite is significant, as we\u2019ve talked about historically, but the bar on inorganic growth continues to get higher for us just as we scale we\u2019re finding that we can build businesses by doing team with that or team builds, use our capital scale to fund them and drive meaningful growth. So our alternative credit group, our special opportunities, those are groups where we were able to engage in meaningful team builds. And you\u2019re seeing the value creation come through in the successful fundraising in pretty short order. So as we talked about historically, when we\u2019re going to do M&A, it has to check three simple boxes that aren\u2019t always that easy to check. It has to be financially accretive, and the economics need to make sense. We need to have a path to add value to the business, but we also need to see that, that business is going to add value to our platform by bringing differentiated distribution or information or capability. And then it\u2019s got to be a great cultural fit, and the cultural fit piece is probably always the hardest to check the box on. SSG did all of those things for us, right? They gave us a meaningful beachhead with a tenured manager in a region where we just did not have a scaled presence, the cultural fit, good economic value proposition and now adding things to it should be fairly straightforward. So I think we\u2019re going to continue to look to fill in product gaps, geography gaps, distribution gaps through acquisition, but the bar is pretty high. One thing I will remind everybody, through prior downturns, we\u2019ve been very acquisitive, both within portfolio companies like ARCC, subsidiary companies or at the management company. And when you think about deployment, we tend to see acquisition opportunities arise when we get into this type of dislocation. So while we\u2019re obviously working with our corporate strategy teams to proactively identify assets and companies that would be good additions to the platform, markets like this tend to present opportunistic opportunities as well. And I think we\u2019ll begin to see that develop into the back half of the year.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMike Carrier: Mike McFerran, just given the current margin, the fundraising outlook, the deals and then the current backdrop, just any change in how you\u2019re thinking about the outlook for the margin over, say, the next one to two years versus some of your comments?\nMike McFerran: No, no change at all. I think the margin is consistent with what we\u2019ve said since our fourth quarter call, which is we expected that to deliver a 34% margin this year, or at least 34%, and we thought we would hit a run rate of 35% this year. If you look at the margin for the quarter, it\u2019s over 34%. We feel, as we\u2019ve talked about in past calls that you referenced, Mike, that as we continue to grow, we capture benefits of scale and we continue to identify operating efficiencies and leverage those, and all that leads itself to margin expansion, which we think is just going to continue. So I don\u2019t see any obstacles to that in the years ahead.\nMike Carrier: Okay. And then just as a follow-up. Given some of your guys\u2019 comments and like what we see in terms of divergence between the public and some of the private markets, it makes sense that there are multiple points of opportunities are attractive. But just in terms of the current portfolio companies, maybe how are they holding up in this backdrop, areas that you\u2019re seeing, maybe some challenges versus in the portfolio where you\u2019re seeing relative strength, once we kind of get out of that, you could start to realize some of the investment.\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. So it\u2019s a simple question with not a straightforward answer just given the breadth of funds on the platform and the breadth of assets that we touch. So I\u2019ll simplify the answer if you want to drill deeper on any piece we can. But Id\u2019 say, generally, the underwriting going into the downturn was extraordinarily sound across the entire portfolio. And you\u2019ll see that, for example, Kipp talked about on the ARCC call that while we\u2019re dealing with some challenges as would be expected in the portfolio, the fact that we are underweight, the most heavily impacted industries is beginning to bear fruit and shall benefit. The fact that we are underweight, hospitality and retail in our real estate portfolios, both debt and equity, is a huge benefit. So I think a lot of this came down to good conservative positioning and cyclical industry avoidance going into the downturn, which now positions us, combined with the liquidity that we have within each of our funds, to continue to play offense and drive value. As we talked about in the script, probably the one place where we\u2019ve seen the most negative return has been in our energy portfolio. It\u2019s not surprising. And if you look at the performance, as we talked about in the PE composite, if you look at the nonenergy returns this quarter and the regular way portfolios, you would have seen roughly 20% type return. So the focus on healthcare, technology, differentiated consumer, that\u2019s actually playing out well for us. And I think that\u2019s pretty consistent across the entire platform, regardless of the business or the geography.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Adam Beatty with UBS. Please go ahead.\nAdam Beatty: I wanted to ask about CLOs, both in the Ares managed book and then more broadly across the environment. There was some concern before the pandemic and then kind of a spiking concern as the pandemic hit, and it seems as though that the outcome, so far, at least, has been milder than some had feared. So I just wanted to get your observations in terms of the fundamentals and also the trajectory of rating agency activity and whether that\u2019s a concern.\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. Sure. So I we never fully appreciated the significant concerns that the market and maybe the media had with regard to the CLO market. And if you go back and look at CLO performance, particularly on the rated tranches through the financial crisis, it\u2019s a pretty good indicator that the self-healing structures within CLOs is pretty resilient. And so we\u2019re not surprised to see that resilience playing out now. The other interesting thing is when you look at the structure of the loan market today versus the structure of the loan market through the GFC, CLOs currently represent probably 65%-plus of the loan buy in the loan market, which is significantly higher than it was the last go around. And maybe not so obvious, that\u2019s actually created a significant amount of stability because you don\u2019t have frantic selling, which is obviously muting some of the downward pressure on price and just creating overall price and pricing stability in the market. So if you actually look at CLO exposure to the weakest loans in the loan market, they\u2019re underweight relative to the 35% non-CLO buyer, which is actually a pretty good indication both to the credit discipline of the CLO managers themselves, but also kind of the imposed discipline that the structured places on those buyers. There is always, and we\u2019ve talked about this, a risk that with continued downgrades that CCC baskets are triggered and OC tests are triggered, and that has some implications for the structures. But again, even in cases where that happens, they\u2019ll be able to heal themselves. So we\u2019re still quite constructive on CLOs. Obviously, the new issue market has slowed. But for the embedded universe of CLOs, both as a CLO manager and as a buyer of rated and non-rated tranches of other people CLOs, we still see them as very resilient and very durable.\nAdam Beatty: Excellent. And then I just wanted to ask about the insurance channel, kind of separate and apart from any delays and what have you with Pavonia just in terms of the level of activity and demand that you\u2019re seeing and kind of what you\u2019re able to do kind of pre-closing on that transaction to kind of do a pre-build or what have you.\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. Thanks, Adam. So yes, with regard to Pavonia, as we talked about on our last call, the closing has been delayed, but we\u2019re still optimistic that it will happen in the near future. The good news is because of the structure of that transaction, we\u2019ve been able to do, to your point, all of the pre-work on new product construction, getting the distribution engine ready to turn on when we close that transaction. I think folks are also aware that when we talk about Ares Insurance Solutions and Aspida, it\u2019s not just the organic distribution of the origination business, but there\u2019s a view that we also have an opportunity on the M&A front to grow through acquisition and to build a reinsurance platform alongside the annuities platform. So even though the Pavonia acquisition has delayed all of the work around building the M&A and reinsurance pipeline, it has actually been going quite smoothly and has a lot of momentum. So we\u2019re happy with where that is. And then secondly, as we\u2019ve talked about before, while Pavonia is an important piece of the insurance strategy here at Ares, the insurance strategy is multipronged and includes things like building up our IDF complex, continuing to drive strategic partnerships with insurance companies around certain parts of our private credit business, continuing to distribute product to our insurance clients, and those are all scaling a long time as well. So I would say we\u2019re as bullish as we\u2019ve ever been about the insurance opportunity, and I think we\u2019re executing well. We\u2019re anxious to get our Pavonia deal closed, but it\u2019s not preventing us from making progress in other business.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Kenneth Lee with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nKenneth Lee: Just one following up on your prepared remarks in regards to how portfolio realizations could be slow, just hoping that you could just further expand upon your comments and perhaps just talk about some of the key factors that could be keeping the utilization slow, despite the current equity markets.\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. I\u2019ll give you my view. And then again, Matt or David should be able to give their view. We\u2019re seeing activity pick up. The challenge, I think, that you see in kind of regular way transaction flow putting the public markets aside for a second is when you were dealing with either liquidity challenges or liquidity uncertainty or a lack of earnings visibility. It\u2019s just hard to clear equity, right? The bid-ask spread on equities can be pretty wide as people are trying to figure out what 2020, 2021, 2022 earnings are going to look like. And then two, which is benefiting us on the direct lending and private credit side, availability of debt capital to certain companies and certain assets is constrained in that challenges valuation. So I don\u2019t want to give the impression that we think that there is 0 path toward realization. I just think that we need a little bit more visibility around earnings and liquidity positioning for certain companies to start to get back to a regular type of cadence around transaction flow. But to the public company side, as you mentioned, and that\u2019s why I do think that we\u2019ll have an opportunity, and the AZEK IPO is a perfect example of that, particularly for the non-COVID-type companies, AZEK being one of them making building products, we saw huge investor demand, a really attractive valuation and then an acceleration to valuation post-IPO. So I think that the public markets will continue to be constructive for realizations. I don\u2019t know, Matt, do you want to add any color on top of that?\nMatt Cwiertnia: Sure, sure. Yes. From a private equity perspective, I would say, everything Mike is saying is spot on. And especially July, that bid-ask has been people trying to figure out on the private side, can we get to a deal. I do think there\u2019s a bit of a rate of change in the market, meaning a bit of warming in the market, where even week by week right now, people are becoming more optimistic and narrowing that spread, such that if you saw that continue, I do think post-Labor Day, you could see a pickup in transactions and then, for us, potentially in realization. So I think that has been true. And if it stayed the same as July, I think that statement would be true. But there is some optimism, I think, on the traditional side that buyers and sellers are going to get together a little bit more often, and that would include some of our portfolio companies that might be ready for realization come the back half of this year if the environment continues to improve.\nKenneth Lee: Great. Very helpful. And just one follow-up, if I may. I wonder if I could just get your latest thoughts on FRE growth in the near term given that there\u2019s a lot of factors at play here between the fundraising as well as the ongoing capital deployments.\nMike McFerran: Kenneth, it\u2019s Mike. I would just reiterate, and I think our numbers are expressing this as you look at the year-over-year growth. But I know the last couple of quarters, we\u2019ve highlighted that we believe between capital we\u2019ve already raised, I\u2019d point you to the AUM not yet earning fees, where there\u2019s a significant amount of what we\u2019ll call just natural revenue growth built into the capital we have today just from deployment. That, combined with the continued margin expansion we\u2019re seeing, and then Mike obviously talked in detail in the prepared remarks about the meaningful amount of capital raising we\u2019re having, all of that combined, we feel like will lend itself to just reiterating the expectation that we have high conviction, we\u2019ll be able to continue to grow FRE 15% or better because I\u2019m not putting magic behind the 15%, although it\u2019s kind of a round number. But again, when you looked at our Q1 growth year-over-year, our second quarter growth year-over-year, first half of the year growth year-over-year, we\u2019re obviously running ahead of that and expect we will continue to do so.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nChrist Harris: Yes. A follow-up for Mike McFerran on expenses. Mike, you mentioned G&A was a little light in the second quarter due to travel-related restrictions. Assuming those restrictions remain in place, is this a decent run rate for G&A spend? Or is there some spending that\u2019s going to pick up in the second half of the year, which would potentially drive the number up?\nMike McFerran: Look, it\u2019s SG&A is going to be have a little bit of movement around, and we had a little bit of travel, obviously, we\u2019re saving money because it\u2019s a fraction of what it was. Yes, my best guess would probably I would expect to be seeing G&A run between $41 million $40 million to $41 million, all else being equal. It has to as Mike mentioned, with all the capital raising going on, there\u2019s obviously some expenses we incur with that. The pace at which we can do other things, we do spend obviously a bit. While we\u2019re saving a lot in travel, we do lean in on other aspects of this, with supporting our employees of technology and other services. But I think kind of like a $40 million expectation, $40 million, $41 million is realistic.\nMichael Arougheti: And Mike, I\u2019ll just add, maybe just a quick oversimplification, but I think it\u2019s important is, obviously, when we\u2019re spending on things like travel or entertainment or conferences, all of those things tend to come against incremental fundraising and incremental deployment. So I would even say that anything above Mike\u2019s target would probably come with corollary increase in revenue and would still continue to be accretive to the development of FRE and FRE margin.\nMike McFerran: Yes. I agree with that.\nChrist Harris: Okay. If travel comes back, a higher number than $40 million to $41 million.\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. I still think we\u2019re going to be able to run the business. Yes, I still expect G&A to kind of run rate when travels back to be in the low-40s quarterly.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cyprys: Just as you think about product level profitability, I was just hoping you talk a little bit about your approach to product and strategy level of profitability. How do you approach and think about that? Which strategies do you think will be the make the biggest contribution, helping improve the overall profitability over the next couple of years? Imagine the special sits fund will be very meaningful this year and into next year. Which other strategies come to mind? And which ones, in your view, would probably have to wait a couple more years for more scaling?\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. Again, a simple question, but not a simple answer just given the breadth of number of funds and strategies on the platform. As you would probably expect prior to launching any new product, we go through a pretty exhaustive strategic and operational review of the product in terms of assessing investor demand, thinking about the operational complexity of the product, the cost to raise it, the cost to run it and, then obviously, the long-term business plan around the products and what that means for the development of FRE and, ultimately, shareholder value of the management company. And that\u2019s a very rigorous process, and not every idea gets through that filter. And I actually think that\u2019s a big part of the evolution of the industry where you learn as you mature that not all AUM is good AUM, and you have to focus on scale of the profitable AUM. And so you are seeing that in places like special opportunities and alternative credit, where we\u2019ve gone out against the business plan, hired 15 to 20 people over a multiyear period, incurred that expense with a very high level of conviction around the business plan. So you did highlight two recent initiatives that you should expect to see some pretty dramatic margin scaling because we\u2019ve already incurred the expense to hire the team, put the process in place, raise the capital, but those funds pay on invested. I think you should expect, given the upcoming fundraise in our European direct lending business, as we talked about in our prepared remarks, even though that business already runs at a pretty healthy mature margin, but just given the scale of that fund, that you\u2019ll see some margin expansion there as well. Real estate, as we\u2019ve talked about historically, is actually running at the lowest business line FRE margin, but it\u2019s growing its FRE margin quicker than other parts of the business. So we are beginning to see the benefits of scale roll through as we\u2019re getting through this most recent fundraise cycle with our U.S. op fund and our value-add funds. So I think you\u2019ll continue to see margin scaling there, but we still have some scaling to do to get to the types of margins that we enjoy in the mature credit and mature PE businesses. So as I was saying, expectations also that, hopefully, SSG will run at a more mature margin just given the size of that business relative to its capital base as well.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. And maybe just a quick follow-up question, apologies if I had interrupted you. The sound quality is not that great on my line given the storms. But just on strategic partnerships, I think you had mentioned it\u2019s another growing part of the firm. Maybe you could just update us on some of the initiatives there. Maybe just some of the capital you have in these strategic partnerships, how is that trending, what initiatives you have in place? And how do you think about scaling those strategic partnerships over time? I imagine those are highly customized offerings. What are you doing about it? How do you think about scaling that?\nMichael Arougheti: So strategic partnerships, I\u2019d say, take many forms. And I just want to clarify, we have certain strategic partnerships that are more partnerships around a specific part of the business, whether they\u2019re capital provider or a strategic LP. So a good example of that would be the SDLP unitranche joint venture that we have within ARCC. We then have strategic partnerships, which are bespoke and customized relationships with some of the larger institutional LPs around portions of our business, and that has been a big growth area for us. So when you look at managed accounts as a percentage of our AUM, you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s a pretty healthy number. Those are slower to develop in terms of the sales cycle because it\u2019s not like a commingled fund where you launch a product, set up a data room, do your transactional market and close. It\u2019s much more consultative. It\u2019s much more collaborative. And the whole process is geared toward trying to be a solutions provider for our larger clients. The good news is, as we continue to broaden out the product set, we have a much more robust offering to meet the needs of the clients. And so we are seeing an acceleration in the number of conversations that we have with our LPs. Another thing that we\u2019ve had to do, as we staffed up around that opportunity, is we\u2019ve built out a client strategy and solutions team that\u2019s focused on the entirety of the client experience front to back. And it\u2019s there where we\u2019re working on all of the risk analytics and portfolio modeling to help drive the collaboration around what those relationships could look like. So I can\u2019t be too specific, but it could be someone gives us capital to invest in a global direct lending mandate. It could be that someone says, \"I want you to tactically take advantage of distressed opportunities that you see in these specific industries,\" and it really runs the gamut. And we\u2019re offering ideas to our clients where we see value, and they\u2019re coming to us where they have a need. And you hope that where we see value and where they have a need that there\u2019s an intersection of opportunity. And that\u2019s kind of how we, at a high level, think about driving that part of the business.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Jacoby: This is Daniel Jacoby filling in for Alex. Just quickly on the credit management fees, looks like ARCC base management fees and Part I fees came down a little bit quarter-over-quarter. Can you just help us get a little bit of a look underneath the hood as to what\u2019s kind of going on there and how we should think about the outlook for fees generated from ARCC going forward?\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. Mike, do you want to handle that?\nMike McFerran: Yes, sure. Yes, I think between the base management fee and the Part I fee, the combined decline quarter-over-quarter was about $5 million. I think, as you know, it\u2019s going to be the management fees are a function of gross assets at ARCC. So and then as far as also transactional activity, which supports the Part I, look, I think and I would refer to Kipp, but if you look historically at that fee, there\u2019s as the business continues to grow, there\u2019s an implied steadiness to it because the business is so big, so you don\u2019t see a lot of volatility that would be, again, albeit saying come in about $5 million quarter-over-quarter. I would highlight, I think we\u2019ve touched on this before, that about 60% of the Part I is paid out as comp, so the impact to FRE is a smaller impact from that because there\u2019s an offsetting compensation benefit.\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. Daniel, there was also a nuance, I don\u2019t know if we can cover it off-line if I don\u2019t do a good job articulating it. But when we work to get the leverage available to BDCs from 1:1 to 2:1, and we restruck the management agreement, we accepted a lower fee above the 1:1 leverage. So the fee steps down, I believe, from 1.5% on assets to 1% for all assets above 1:1 leverage. And ironically, and I don\u2019t think that this was the original intent, so it\u2019s a little bit of a perversion of that original contract intent to align interest with the shareholders as we levered potentially lower ROA assets to drive ROE and growth in the dividend. What happened I think in Q1 and Q2, because it\u2019s an average look back on assets, because of the write down of the assets in the book in Q1, you actually saw leverage go up through the write down of NAV as opposed to the leveraging of the balance sheet through incremental debt. And so as a result, to Mike\u2019s point, you had a little bit of a hit because the gross assets were lower and then you had a modest hit because you triggered the 1% above the 1:1 leverage for assets that, in the prior quarter, were actually operating below the 1:1 because of the NAV. So as NAV improves, which it did this quarter, and we expect it will continue to, and as deployment continues, and as Kipp talked about on the call yesterday, we have about $4 billion of available liquidity at ARCC, we\u2019d expect to see that fee continue as it was.\nDaniel Jacoby: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful color. And then just secondly, on Sumitomo, can you maybe just walk us through what you anticipate is kind of the economic benefit from this partnership and how we should think about kind of the contribution to AUM, the prepaying AUM to management fees from this partnership?\nMichael Arougheti: I can\u2019t I\u2019m not going to go into specifics on the business plan yet. But as we execute, I think we\u2019ll come back and we\u2019ll be able to articulate the initiatives that we\u2019ve executed on with them, and you guys can see what the impact is. We\u2019re still in the early days. But as we talked about when we announced the partnership, we have been working through a pipeline of strategic opportunities to leverage their balance sheet, both in existing businesses and new businesses, and we\u2019re executing well against that. So we\u2019ve had already a number of situations where they\u2019ve made large capital contributions into various portfolios and business launches that, we think, will be accretive, either because we\u2019re launching businesses at the management company or because they\u2019re providing creative and efficient financing solutions into some of our funds and some of our subsidiaries. So stay tuned for that. But as we continue to execute, I think we\u2019re going to have some pretty good examples to share with all of you. The second piece, which we talked about, which will take a little bit more time, was just thinking long term and strategically about the distribution opportunity for alternative product in Japan. I think it\u2019s as we talked about in prior calls, now that we have SSG and we have a broader product set in region to complement our U.S. and European offering, I think that, that distribution partnership potential has improved. And then third, we\u2019ve talked a little bit just about capital markets collaboration and ways to work together given the size of their balance sheet and the size of our capital base and relationships to drive value. That also is going to take some time, but I\u2019m still optimistic. So stay tuned on it, but without getting into the details, we\u2019ve already made significant progress, and they followed through pretty helpfully with the capital commitments that we expected here in the first couple of months that I mentioned.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Robert Lee with KBW. Please go ahead.\nRobert Lee: Well, I have some question on I guess, related question on taxes excuse me, the dividend taxes. So if I remember correctly, you kind of try to set the dividend each year to kind of the I remember you have kind of, I think, after-tax FRE may be headed. So I guess, the first part of that is a given last quarter kind of at the $0.40 and it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re kind of quite at the $0.40 after-tax FRE yet. Is it fair to think that, that\u2019s kind of how you\u2019re thinking about it developing toward the end of this year. And then next year, where have you kind of think FRE could finish the year is kind of how you\u2019ll think about the dividend next year?\nMike McFerran: Yes. Rob, I think that\u2019s pretty close. I mean, if you recall, as we\u2019ve described this, we thoughtfully used the term pegged because we didn\u2019t want to ever get caught up with doing a fixed time period, look back or look forward. So instead, our view is to peg the dividend growth to what we believe would be the expected after-tax FRE growth. So obviously, the two variables there are FRE growth and tax rates. To that end, and we should probably highlight, we\u2019ve been keeping our effective tax rate on FRE quite low. I know earlier we had probably guided that would be something more in the 8% to 11%. I\u2019d say, for this quarter, the tax rate on FRE was just over 2.5%. For the year, it feels like it\u2019s probably going to be sub-5 is my best guess today. But obviously, there\u2019s different variables that can impact that. But I think as we look to future dividend growth, it\u2019s going to be the trajectory of as we expect FRE to grow and how we think about the after-tax mix of that. But again, I wouldn\u2019t you highlighted the numbers for this quarter, I think that\u2019s accurate because, and if you saw this last year, if we were generating $0.40 after-tax FRE two quarters in, that I think we would have underground the dividend because that\u2019s something, I think, that kind of sets us throughout the year. So I we kind of would to your point, I think that we would look at where we expect it to grow next year. And obviously, our Board will make the decision as we head into Q1.\nRobert Lee: Great. And then maybe the second part, you mentioned some kind of tax on Tesla\u2019s has been running low. It seemed that maybe unusually low this quarter. What should we you mentioned the 5% on FRE. I mean, how should we be thinking about kind of realized income? And would it should we expect it to kind of normalize into next year?\nMike McFerran: As we\u2019ve said in the past, it\u2019s obviously going to be heavily dependent on realizations. So a meaningful dollars of realizations later in the year would push the rate, I\u2019d probably say, realized income north of 10%. For the year, based on our commentary on the call about as we think about the environment today, I kind of feel like it\u2019s going to be probably still in that 9% to 12% range, probably a little closer. So I think it probably most likely will be 10-ish or under. But I guess, it\u2019s going to be a function of realization. So tax, if we more realizations, when you have a little bit higher effective tax rate, but not a bad thing.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Michael Arougheti for any closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir.\nMichael Arougheti: Thanks, operator. We don\u2019t have any other than I want to reiterate that we hope that everybody stays safe and well, and that\u2019s true for you and yours. And I just want to thank everybody at Ares for the incredible work. I don\u2019t think anybody on this call, whether it\u2019s Ares or elsewhere, has fully appreciated what it would take to continue to drive our businesses forward in their remote environment. And when you look at these results and the amount of work that went into it, I just wanted to make sure that we thank everybody, again, for all the hard work to continue to deliver these types of outcomes. So I hope everybody enjoys the end of summer and look forward to catching up on next quarter\u2019s call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our conference call for today.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matt Cwiertnia",
            "content": "Sure. This is Matt Cwiertnia. So from a private equity perspective, I think we think our flexible capital mandate right now is probably as relevant and balanced as ever. We see things really both on the distressed side and on the traditional side. One thing I\u2019d point out on the distressed side is the small and medium businesses or the middle market are really struggling more than you would be led to believe if you just follow the S&P 500 or the NASDAQ. And so we are seeing a number of really private rescue capital opportunities on the distressed side because the middle market doesn\u2019t have the access to some of the government programs that the large caps do. And on the traditional side, as Mike alluded to, there are just some industries and some companies that are doing OK and have growth opportunities in front of them that can go and play offense. So I think the backlog for traditional throughout the industry and certainly for ourselves, it is growing. I think, in the second half of this year, if this stays on trend, I think you\u2019ll see more regular way private equity here before the end of the year and probably bigger in the second half than you saw in the first half.\nGerald O\u2019Hara: Okay. Helpful comments. And just perhaps one follow-up. You\u2019ve obviously been active with SSG and as well as SMBC. But Mike, could you perhaps give a sense for what the firm appetite is perhaps even capacity for additional strategic partnerships and M&A-type activity at this point in the cycle? Sure, sure. Yes. From a private equity perspective, I would say, everything Mike is saying is spot on. And especially July, that bid-ask has been people trying to figure out on the private side, can we get to a deal. I do think there\u2019s a bit of a rate of change in the market, meaning a bit of warming in the market, where even week by week right now, people are becoming more optimistic and narrowing that spread, such that if you saw that continue, I do think post-Labor Day, you could see a pickup in transactions and then, for us, potentially in realization. So I think that has been true. And if it stayed the same as July, I think that statement would be true. But there is some optimism, I think, on the traditional side that buyers and sellers are going to get together a little bit more often, and that would include some of our portfolio companies that might be ready for realization come the back half of this year if the environment continues to improve."

            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Hello, everyone. I hope you and your families are safe and well. I will begin with some highlights on the quarter and then provide a more in-depth review of our results and current financial position. The second quarter was our 13th consecutive quarter of sequential FRE growth. The steady growth is driven by our management fee-centric business model, which drove 84% of our realized income in the second quarter. Our FRE margin stands at over 34%, as we continue to scale and improve margins. The over $9 billion of gross fundraising helped assets under management and fee-paying AUM reach new highs, which increased 11.5% and 18%, respectively, over the last 12 months, and this fundraising drove our shadow AUM to $27.8 billion. During the quarter, we saw a fairly broad-based recovery in the performance of our significant funds across credit, private equity and real estate. We also realized a portion of our position in Floor & Decor, a highly successful publicly held position in our Private Equity Group, which supported our realized income this quarter, despite the muted overall realization environment. Now let me take you through the results in further detail. Fee-related earnings for the quarter totaled $97 million, an increase of 26% from the second quarter of 2019. Year-to-date, our fee-related earnings of $190 million was up 28% from the same period last year and highlights our continued growth trajectory, even through times of significant volatility. Fee-related earnings growth was driven by 13% management fee growth from the prior year period as well as a decrease in general and administrative expenses, which declined over $5 million from the second quarter of 2019 in part due to continued travel restrictions. As we grow our AUM and fee-paying AUM through fundraising and deployment across several new strategies, our FRE margin has continued to expand. FRE margins were 34% in the quarter and for the first half of 2020 compared to 30.5% for the first half of 2019. Realized income for the quarter totaled $115.2 million, which represents an increase of $20.9 million or 22% as compared to the second quarter of 2019. After-tax realized income per share of Class A common stock, net of preferred stock distributions, was $0.39 for the second quarter, an increase of 22% from the second quarter of 2019. Next I\u2019d like to spend some time on our AUM and related metrics. Our AUM as of June 30 totaled $158.4 billion compared to $142.1 billion last year, an increase of 11.5% year-over-year. AUM was driven by additional gross commitments across our fund strategies, with near record inflows in the quarter, as well as significant market appreciation, which received some of the depreciation we saw in Q1. Our gross new capital commitments totaled $9.1 billion in the quarter, including the first close of our sixth flagship corporate private equity fund as well as the final close for our special opportunities fund, which accounted for more than half of the fundraising for the quarter. Our fee-paying AUM increased 18% year-over-year driven by meaningful deployment in our European and U.S. direct lending strategies, special opportunities and alternative credit strategy as well as additional commitments within our liquid credit strategy. We ended the quarter with $105.5 billion of fee-paying AUM, which is represented by approximately 75% credit funds, 16% private equity funds and 9% real estate funds. Our available capital increased to a new record high of $39.2 billion driven by additional commitments from our flagship fund families, including corporate private equity, special opportunities and alternative credit strategies. We ended the quarter with $27.8 billion of AUM not yet paying fees, of which approximately $25 billion is available for future deployment, which, if deployed, corresponds to annual management fees totaling $253 million. Last, our incentive-eligible AUM increased by over $6 billion to $91.8 billion. Of this amount, $30.7 billion was uninvested at quarter end. Although the market decline caused a decline in our net accrued carry balance in the first quarter, the strong market rebound and the successful IPO of the AZEK Co. helped drive our net accrued performance income to $289 million, a 23% increase from March 31. With strong levels of shadow AUM, along with our net accrued performance income, we believe we have the building blocks in place to generate and recognize meaningful, long-term value through additional performance fees. We believe our history of investing across market cycles, combined with a wide array of flexible fund strategies, represents a significant competitive advantage as we navigate through the current and future market environment. From a portfolio perspective, we feel good about the general health and performance of the portfolio as the vast majority of our investments are at the top of the capital structure in resilient, less-cyclical businesses. Firmwide, we are overweighted in areas like healthcare, software and various services businesses and generally underweighted in more COVID-impacted sectors. I\u2019d like to take a moment to address our strong financial position and our recent long-term debt issuance. As Mike stated, we recently took advantage of the low interest rate environment and rebounding public debt markets by issuing $400 million in 10-year notes in a successful offering at 3.25%, a substantially lower rate than our existing notes. This puts our balance sheet in an excellent position and provides us with the ability to generate accretive returns on our capital for the management company. We entered the second quarter with nearly $2 billion in liquidity, with $890 million in cash on the balance sheet and no amounts drawn on our $1.065 billion corporate revolving credit facility. We have no maturities until 2024, and when subtracting all of our debt from our cash, we have nearly $250 million of cash left over. As a reminder, our outstanding $300 million of 7% perpetual preferred stock is callable as of June 2021. As we get closer, we will evaluate calling and retiring this equity, as it is comparatively expensive. If we elect to do so, we expect it would be meaningfully accretive to our earnings. We enter the back half of 2020 extremely well capitalized, with no net debt, no near-term debt maturities and no mark-to-market balance sheet leverage. We believe our strong balance sheet and significant liquidity gives us great optionality and flexibility to be opportunistic and patient during this expected volatile period. In conclusion, we believe that our business is very well positioned in the current environment and for what lies ahead. Our management fee-centric business rooted in credit and flexible strategies, coupled with our balance sheet-light model and strong liquidity, puts us in an excellent position to drive continued growth and profitability and to be opportunistic as this market evolves. We have significant fundraising momentum with a large pipeline of flagship funds, and our investors recognize our ability to perform well during volatile and down markets. Our investment professionals are finding creative ways to make compelling investments, as the competitive landscape provides opportunity, and the collaboration across our platform has never been stronger or more valuable. Our shadow AUM puts us in an excellent position to invest well and generate attractive growth in revenues and earnings. We feel good about the health of our overall portfolio, and we have excellent portfolio management teams maximizing value, sharing best practices and generating synergies across our global portfolios. We are so impressed by the resilience and grit that our teams have demonstrated, and we are grateful for all of their incredible work to deliver yet another record quarter of results, despite all of the current challenges. We appreciate all of your continuing support for our company, and thank you for the time today. Operator, could you please open up the line for questions? No, no change at all. I think the margin is consistent with what we\u2019ve said since our fourth quarter call, which is we expected that to deliver a 34% margin this year, or at least 34%, and we thought we would hit a run rate of 35% this year. If you look at the margin for the quarter, it\u2019s over 34%. We feel, as we\u2019ve talked about in past calls that you referenced, Mike, that as we continue to grow, we capture benefits of scale and we continue to identify operating efficiencies and leverage those, and all that leads itself to margin expansion, which we think is just going to continue. So I don\u2019t see any obstacles to that in the years ahead. Kenneth, it\u2019s Mike. I would just reiterate, and I think our numbers are expressing this as you look at the year-over-year growth. But I know the last couple of quarters, we\u2019ve highlighted that we believe between capital we\u2019ve already raised, I\u2019d point you to the AUM not yet earning fees, where there\u2019s a significant amount of what we\u2019ll call just natural revenue growth built into the capital we have today just from deployment. That, combined with the continued margin expansion we\u2019re seeing, and then Mike obviously talked in detail in the prepared remarks about the meaningful amount of capital raising we\u2019re having, all of that combined, we feel like will lend itself to just reiterating the expectation that we have high conviction, we\u2019ll be able to continue to grow FRE 15% or better because I\u2019m not putting magic behind the 15%, although it\u2019s kind of a round number. But again, when you looked at our Q1 growth year-over-year, our second quarter growth year-over-year, first half of the year growth year-over-year, we\u2019re obviously running ahead of that and expect we will continue to do so. Look, it\u2019s SG&A is going to be have a little bit of movement around, and we had a little bit of travel, obviously, we\u2019re saving money because it\u2019s a fraction of what it was. Yes, my best guess would probably I would expect to be seeing G&A run between $41 million $40 million to $41 million, all else being equal. It has to as Mike mentioned, with all the capital raising going on, there\u2019s obviously some expenses we incur with that. The pace at which we can do other things, we do spend obviously a bit. While we\u2019re saving a lot in travel, we do lean in on other aspects of this, with supporting our employees of technology and other services. But I think kind of like a $40 million expectation, $40 million, $41 million is realistic. Yes. I agree with that. Yes, sure. Yes, I think between the base management fee and the Part I fee, the combined decline quarter-over-quarter was about $5 million. I think, as you know, it\u2019s going to be the management fees are a function of gross assets at ARCC. So and then as far as also transactional activity, which supports the Part I, look, I think and I would refer to Kipp, but if you look historically at that fee, there\u2019s as the business continues to grow, there\u2019s an implied steadiness to it because the business is so big, so you don\u2019t see a lot of volatility that would be, again, albeit saying come in about $5 million quarter-over-quarter. I would highlight, I think we\u2019ve touched on this before, that about 60% of the Part I is paid out as comp, so the impact to FRE is a smaller impact from that because there\u2019s an offsetting compensation benefit. Yes. Rob, I think that\u2019s pretty close. I mean, if you recall, as we\u2019ve described this, we thoughtfully used the term pegged because we didn\u2019t want to ever get caught up with doing a fixed time period, look back or look forward. So instead, our view is to peg the dividend growth to what we believe would be the expected after-tax FRE growth. So obviously, the two variables there are FRE growth and tax rates. To that end, and we should probably highlight, we\u2019ve been keeping our effective tax rate on FRE quite low. I know earlier we had probably guided that would be something more in the 8% to 11%. I\u2019d say, for this quarter, the tax rate on FRE was just over 2.5%. For the year, it feels like it\u2019s probably going to be sub-5 is my best guess today. But obviously, there\u2019s different variables that can impact that. But I think as we look to future dividend growth, it\u2019s going to be the trajectory of as we expect FRE to grow and how we think about the after-tax mix of that. But again, I wouldn\u2019t you highlighted the numbers for this quarter, I think that\u2019s accurate because, and if you saw this last year, if we were generating $0.40 after-tax FRE two quarters in, that I think we would have underground the dividend because that\u2019s something, I think, that kind of sets us throughout the year. So I we kind of would to your point, I think that we would look at where we expect it to grow next year. And obviously, our Board will make the decision as we head into Q1. As we\u2019ve said in the past, it\u2019s obviously going to be heavily dependent on realizations. So a meaningful dollars of realizations later in the year would push the rate, I\u2019d probably say, realized income north of 10%. For the year, based on our commentary on the call about as we think about the environment today, I kind of feel like it\u2019s going to be probably still in that 9% to 12% range, probably a little closer. So I think it probably most likely will be 10-ish or under. But I guess, it\u2019s going to be a function of realization. So tax, if we more realizations, when you have a little bit higher effective tax rate, but not a bad thing."

            "name": "Michael Arougheti",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Carl, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope everyone is healthy and safe, and I wish you and your families well. So now with the full quarter of the impact of the COVID pandemic behind us, we\u2019re pleased that our results continue to be strong, and we couldn\u2019t be more proud of how our employees have adapted to the current challenges. Our consistent revenue and earnings growth reflect our resilient management fee-centric business model and our steady growth in clients and AUM in the global market for alternative investments. Our second quarter was our 13th consecutive quarter of sequential fee-related earnings growth with FRE of $97 million, an increase of 26% from the same period last year. In addition to reporting record FRE, our second quarter also set new records for most of our other key metrics, including management fees, AUM and fee-paying AUM. Our second quarter FRE margins reached a post-IPO high, as we continue to gain efficiencies of scale and experience slower operating expense growth. The second quarter was one of our best fundraising quarters ever, with more than $9 billion raised, including approximately $5 billion from funds in our private equity group, and our momentum across the platform is continuing into the second half of the year. Our strong fundraising has set us up well for future growth in management fees and earnings, which could be seen by the sharp increase in our available capital and shadow AUM, as Mike McFerran will discuss in a little bit. From a market perspective, the traded equity and debt markets have been very volatile in the first half of the year, with a quick dramatic sell-off in March, followed by a historic rally in the second quarter as fiscal and monetary stimulus poured in with unprecedented speed and scope. In the first quarter, we invested aggressively into the public traded markets during the dislocation. And in the second quarter, as markets rebounded, we pivoted more toward private investing with an emphasis on rescue capital and assisting larger companies with flexible capital solutions. While actions and policies by the federal government and the Fed have clearly helped provide interim support to the economy and markets broadly during this period, we do think that we\u2019re still in the early days of the economy feeling the broader knock-on effects from this crisis. We continue to believe that tradable market technicals are disconnected from economic fundamentals, and we\u2019re planning for a slow and uneven recovery over the next few years. We believe investment opportunities with outsized returns will be available to those of us with patience, capital and differentiated capabilities. And as we\u2019ve talked about before, and we\u2019ll do more so on our call today, we believe that we\u2019re well positioned to take advantage of this dynamic. There are two strong long-term trends that have benefited our business for many years and have only accelerated with the pandemic. First, on the investing front, the benefits of our scaled self-origination capabilities and our flexible approach have become even more valuable in volatile markets, as investment opportunities pivot between public and private markets. Our coverage and significant relationship network enable us to source attractive opportunities, uncover relative value and take advantage of inconsistent market competition, particularly for larger companies. So while transaction activity today is generally slower, the competitive environment has significantly improved, with many competitors tending to their existing portfolios, reducing workforces or unable to access attractive forms of new capital and liquidity. Many banks have retrenched in both North America and Europe, making it difficult for certain companies and assets to attract capital. This has resulted in opportunities for scaled players, like Ares, to step in where the traded markets are not available or are not as attractive. As an example, in the second quarter, we led the largest unitranche private credit financing ever completed, a nearly GBP two billion private financing for a leading insurance brokerage company in the U.K. This transaction is a great example of what we\u2019re capable of executing for our clients and why many of them turn to private capital for enhanced flexibility and relationship purposes. In this case, we had both U.K. and U.S. relationships with the company sponsors, and we were able to structure a bespoke solution that met the company\u2019s growth needs. As a result, we were able to invest a substantial amount of capital across both our U.S. and European direct lending funds. Our bias toward structuring our funds to be as flexible as possible is an even greater advantage in today\u2019s market environment. As an example, during the second quarter, our alternative credit team led a $400 million transaction for a publicly traded mortgage REIT. We were able to structure an asset-oriented solution, which included a term loan with warrants that enabled the REIT to short its financing and go on offense with respect to new investments and potential acquisitions. Also of note, our special opportunities team sourced a $400 million investment solution for another public company, which operates in the outdoor advertising sector in the form of a convertible preferred. Our teams are focused on helping companies strengthen their financial foundations and enable them to go on offense and consolidate market share. Overall, during the second quarter, we deployed $4.7 billion in our drawdown funds, compared to $4.1 billion from the same period a year ago, primarily in global direct lending, alternative credit and our special opportunity strategies. The second major theme is that investors are continuing to consolidate their relationships and place more of their wallet share with trusted larger scale alternative managers with broad product sets. In this environment, it\u2019s been difficult for investors to diligence new managers, which is leading investors to commit more capital with known relationships. The case for investing in alternatives has also been strengthened given the heightened market volatility in the traded sectors at near 0 interest rates. These factors can all be seen in our strong fundraising statistics year-to-date and our strong pipeline. For the first half of the year, we have now raised $15.7 billion organically, excluding the $2.7 billion in AUM from the Denali purchase in Q1, which now puts us on track for one of our best fundraising years ever. This is even more impressive since none of our large corporate direct lending commingled funds held an LP closing in the first half of the year. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve raised capital directly from 139 institutional investors, including 83 existing Ares investors and 56 new to our platform. The existing investors accounted for 78% of the capital raised, which we believe is a testament to our consistent and strong performance and the deep relationships that we\u2019ve built with many of them over time. Specific to our second quarter fundraising, approximately $5 billion was raised by funds in our Private Equity Group. Our special opportunities fund closed on $1.5 billion during the second quarter, concluding its fundraise at $3.5 billion, well in excess of our $2 billion target. Our sixth flagship corporate private equity fund, which held its first closing during the second quarter, closed at approximately $3.5 billion with 90% coming from existing investors This $7 billion of capital raised by our PE group means that we\u2019re well on our way toward our goal of having at least $10 billion between the two funds to target investments in this attractive environment for stressed and distressed investing as well as for traditional private equity transactions. We also raised $3.9 billion across our credit strategies, which included commitments to public vehicles, new commitments to managed accounts and funds and additional closings on our flagship commingled alternative credit fund. Our alternative credit fund now stand at $1.6 billion toward its $2 billion target, and we continue to expect to meet or exceed our $2 billion target by the end of the year. We also saw about $400 million of additional commitments to our real estate funds, where performance has been consistently strong. Our fundraising momentum is continuing, and our entire organization is highly focused on surpassing at least $30 billion of capital commitments this year, which we\u2019ve only done once before in 2018. We currently have at least nine commingled fundraises, either in the market or to be launched in the next six to nine months, including our four largest private commingled successor funds. These nine funds showcase the breadth of our offering and, together, represent at least $25 billion of incremental equity capital commitments targeted to be raised through the end of this year and into early 2021. They include our fifth European direct lending fund, our sixth corporate private equity fund, our second U.S. junior capital direct lending fund, our second U.S. senior direct lending fund, our alternative credit fund, two real estate PE funds, the third Asian secured lending fund from our new Ares SSG colleagues and our climate infrastructure fund. We launched our fifth European direct lending fund in May, and it\u2019s targeted to be the largest fund in our firm\u2019s history. We\u2019ve seen strong client interest so far, and we expect a significant first close in the coming weeks. In addition, outside of these highlighted funds, our fundraising efforts will certainly continue with our managed accounts and strategic partnerships, our public funds, other commingled funds and close-end vehicles, all of which traditionally account for a sizable amount of our annual capital raised. We\u2019re happy to see that our investors are highly engaged. They\u2019ve ironed out their work-from-home investment processes, and they recognize the attractive investment opportunities that can arise during periods of significant volatility. By expanding our wallet share with our clients, which include leading pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, private banks and others, we believe that we have a long runway for growth as our clients further expand into alternatives, and we have the opportunity to gain share from manager consolidation. In addition, our leading credit, private equity and real estate franchises continue to attract a steady stream of new investors, and we believe this will only be strengthened with over 115 institutional investors being onboarded with the closing of the SSG Capital transaction, of which approximately 90 are new to Ares. We also continue to see an attractive rate of reups into larger existing strategies and a desire to commit new capital into other Ares strategies. Turning to a few other highlights in the quarter. We saw a nice snapback in performance across most of our funds in Q2. The performance was led by our most liquid credit strategies, which rebounded about 9% or more, and both our loan and high-yield strategies continue to outperform their respective benchmarks on a year-to-date basis. Our European direct lending composite and significant U.S. direct lending fund, Ares Capital, which were both less volatile in the first quarter compared to our liquid funds, returned around 2% and 4%, respectively, for the second quarter. Our European and U.S. real estate equity fund composites, which have limited exposure to hospitality and retail properties, continued their resilient performance with gross returns of more than 3% for the second quarter. Our corporate private equity fund composite rebounded nearly 5% driven by strong performance in our public positions, which helped us recapture most of the decline from the first quarter. Our private equity composite performance would have been up more than 20% for the quarter, excluding energy. Given investor sentiment, expected challenges in the energy industry and volatility, we, like certain other managers, are excluding energy from our latest corporate private equity fund. These activities will be completed outside of our sixth fund and in our dedicated energy funds going forward. From a monetization perspective, the markets continue to be slow for most regular way buyout investing, and realizations are likely to remain slow in the near term. On the positive side, transaction activity is in the early stages of recovery, which bodes well for perhaps late 2020 or 2021. The public equity markets have rebounded sharply, creating potential monetization opportunities and capital access for certain non-COVID-impacted sectors. During the second quarter, we took advantage of the market uptick and generated realized income from the sale of a portion of our Floor & Decor position in ACOF III. In addition, one of our portfolio companies in ACOF IV, the AZEK Co., went public through a highly successful IPO in the industrial sector. By the end of the second quarter, AZEK had generated an additional unrealized gain of approximately $1 billion relative to the first quarter. Also within private equity, we recently completed the sale of our infrastructure and power team\u2019s investment in Aviator Wind, the largest single-phased, single-site wind power project in the U.S. This project, which includes power purchasing agreements with two of the 50 largest companies in the U.S., highlights the growing demand for renewable energy in corporate America. And so lastly, before I turn the call over to Mike, I want to provide a brief update on our SSG Capital transaction, which closed in July. We said before we believe the transaction further expands our global leadership position in private credit and enhances our ability to expand our investment capabilities across a strategic and high-growth region. For the past decade, SSG has established itself as one of the leading secured lending and special opportunities investors across the Pan-Asian region and is widely recognized by institutional investors and the corporate communities that they target. The team\u2019s experience, long tenure and track record are particularly valuable in the current market environment. Like other parts of the platform, SSG continues to successfully expand its capital base with the recent closing of approximately $800 million on its latest secured lending fund, bringing its AUM as of June 30 to $6.9 billion. Going forward, we expect Ares SSG will capitalize on the growth opportunity using its broad Pan-Asian footprint and seek to replicate the success that we\u2019ve achieved scaling and diversifying our business across North America and Europe. In addition, our new strategic partnership with SMBC further expands our relationships and connectivity in the region, which we expect will only bolster our opportunities. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike McFerran for his remarks on our business positioning and the quarter\u2019s financial results. Mike? Yes. I think it\u2019s a reasonable objective. One thing I would clarify in the prepared remarks, too, one of the things that makes us unique in terms of our approach to distressed investing is that our special opportunities/special sits capability sits in our private equity group for a lot of reasons we articulated historically in terms of the need to not just be buying distressed securities in the public markets, but to be able to leverage private market origination and portfolio management to improve those situations. So when I think about capital raising and capital deployment in private equity, I think of that whole complex, SOF plus ACOF. And when you look at the success that we had in SOF, given the positioning of that fund and the market opportunity ahead of us, as well as the momentum that we first closed on ACOF, I think our aggregate capital raising plans for that group should continue to meet, if not exceed the targets. Yes, it does. The simple answer is no. But obviously, there\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty in the world. As we talked about in the prepared remarks, I actually think, when we all went to a remote work environment, it actually benefited the larger managers who had deep embedded relationships and managers who are already in market with large fund offerings that actually take advantage of distress. So when you look at our positioning coming into 2020, we had already been actively premarketing and marketing a lot of the funds that we\u2019re raising now, and I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019ve seen continued momentum toward potentially another record fundraising year. I would have had a little bit more concern earlier in the year, but we\u2019re actually seeing a lot of the institutional investor platforms adapt their processes for remote work, and we\u2019re seeing a healthy amount of new LPs come on to the platform as well. So at least, what we\u2019re seeing today, Rob, I\u2019m not seeing any change in behavior. I\u2019d actually become more optimistic that folks are now able to diligence new products and new strategies that should benefit some of the offerings later in the year. Yes, happy to. So just to remind folks, SSG, as I mentioned, has about $7 billion of assets under management. As it sits today, it has two core investment offerings. One is what we refer to as special situations, which is kind of the founding strategy of the group getting back to their tenured AM. And then the second is what we refer to as secured lending, which is more akin to what we all would think of as regular way direct lending. SSG had a very meaningful close on its fifth special situations fund in the fourth quarter of last year prior to our announcement and then launched post the announcement, but pre-closing their latest secured lending fund. And that\u2019s the fund that I referred to in the prepared remarks with which had significant momentum, as you would imagine given the world that we live in. The financial impact, you\u2019ll start to see reporting next quarter now that we\u2019ve closed July one or two and likely will be reported in a separate segment, along with other strategic initiatives that we\u2019re undertaking at the management company, so you\u2019ll begin to see the financial impact. The deal is accretive given the nature of the deal that we structured and the momentum that the company has. Our long-term ambition is to see SSG grow to be not just in the credit business, but to expand its product set and its reach into the other capabilities that we have here, i.e., real estate, private equity, infrastructure, etc. So we have pretty big ambitions, and I think that we had a pretty good playbook given our historical success scaling the businesses that we have in North America and Europe. And a lot of the strategy teams that are working with SSG on that blueprint and business plan are the same folks that have actually executed on the expansion plans in other places as well. Sure. I\u2019ll give you my view, and then I\u2019ll let Matt or David give you some PE-specific commentary if they feel like it. But just to contextualize our deployment, in the second quarter of 2019, as I mentioned, we deployed about $4.1 billion in our drawdown funds. If you look at the number in Q2, that was about $4.7 million. Interestingly, we deployed about $5.5 billion in Q1 in drawdown funds, which I\u2019ll come back to. And if you were to look at the $4.7 billion, that number would grow to about $5.9 million when you include the non-drawdown funds. So deployment has been consistent. And if you remember what we talked about on the last earnings call, the way that we\u2019ve kind of simplified the framework for how we\u2019re going to invest through the crisis is, in Phase 1, which was kind of March into the first week or two of April, there was so much volatility and dislocation in the liquid markets that we were very active there, and that\u2019s why you saw a little bit of a spike in the Q1 deployment. We\u2019re now in Phase 2, which is kind of a focus on the existing portfolio, provide capital to incumbent relationships, build liquidity bridges to the extent that you can and get paid to do so and then begin to go on offense in terms of the new issue market. And some of the things that we talked about in the prepared remarks in the alternative credit, direct lending and special ops parts of our business, I think, are pretty good indicators of the types of opportunities that are coming our way. And then when we get to Phase 3, which is a little bit more market stability, a little bit more earnings visibility and normalcy in the market, that\u2019s when you see more regular weight deployment, but still very, very attractive rates of return because, typically, you\u2019re getting paid significantly higher rates of return for significantly lower risk given the change in the multiple in the leverage environment. So we\u2019re still squarely in that second phase, but I think as we\u2019re getting deeper into this health and economic crisis and a lot of the companies have built liquidity bridges in March to June based on a view that we would have a V-shaped recovery or a snap back or that the fiscal stimulus would actually support meaningful economic growth, I think, are beginning to grapple with the reality that the liquidity bridges that they\u2019ve built may not be long enough. And so the pipeline is starting to reaccelerate around being a solutions provider for some of those companies that are high-quality franchise companies or assets that just aren\u2019t that have no access to the capital the way that we are.\nGerald O\u2019Hara: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Matt, do you have any color commentary you\u2019d like to add on PE? Sure. The appetite is significant, as we\u2019ve talked about historically, but the bar on inorganic growth continues to get higher for us just as we scale we\u2019re finding that we can build businesses by doing team with that or team builds, use our capital scale to fund them and drive meaningful growth. So our alternative credit group, our special opportunities, those are groups where we were able to engage in meaningful team builds. And you\u2019re seeing the value creation come through in the successful fundraising in pretty short order. So as we talked about historically, when we\u2019re going to do M&A, it has to check three simple boxes that aren\u2019t always that easy to check. It has to be financially accretive, and the economics need to make sense. We need to have a path to add value to the business, but we also need to see that, that business is going to add value to our platform by bringing differentiated distribution or information or capability. And then it\u2019s got to be a great cultural fit, and the cultural fit piece is probably always the hardest to check the box on. SSG did all of those things for us, right? They gave us a meaningful beachhead with a tenured manager in a region where we just did not have a scaled presence, the cultural fit, good economic value proposition and now adding things to it should be fairly straightforward. So I think we\u2019re going to continue to look to fill in product gaps, geography gaps, distribution gaps through acquisition, but the bar is pretty high. One thing I will remind everybody, through prior downturns, we\u2019ve been very acquisitive, both within portfolio companies like ARCC, subsidiary companies or at the management company. And when you think about deployment, we tend to see acquisition opportunities arise when we get into this type of dislocation. So while we\u2019re obviously working with our corporate strategy teams to proactively identify assets and companies that would be good additions to the platform, markets like this tend to present opportunistic opportunities as well. And I think we\u2019ll begin to see that develop into the back half of the year. Yes. So it\u2019s a simple question with not a straightforward answer just given the breadth of funds on the platform and the breadth of assets that we touch. So I\u2019ll simplify the answer if you want to drill deeper on any piece we can. But Id\u2019 say, generally, the underwriting going into the downturn was extraordinarily sound across the entire portfolio. And you\u2019ll see that, for example, Kipp talked about on the ARCC call that while we\u2019re dealing with some challenges as would be expected in the portfolio, the fact that we are underweight, the most heavily impacted industries is beginning to bear fruit and shall benefit. The fact that we are underweight, hospitality and retail in our real estate portfolios, both debt and equity, is a huge benefit. So I think a lot of this came down to good conservative positioning and cyclical industry avoidance going into the downturn, which now positions us, combined with the liquidity that we have within each of our funds, to continue to play offense and drive value. As we talked about in the script, probably the one place where we\u2019ve seen the most negative return has been in our energy portfolio. It\u2019s not surprising. And if you look at the performance, as we talked about in the PE composite, if you look at the nonenergy returns this quarter and the regular way portfolios, you would have seen roughly 20% type return. So the focus on healthcare, technology, differentiated consumer, that\u2019s actually playing out well for us. And I think that\u2019s pretty consistent across the entire platform, regardless of the business or the geography. Yes. Sure. So I we never fully appreciated the significant concerns that the market and maybe the media had with regard to the CLO market. And if you go back and look at CLO performance, particularly on the rated tranches through the financial crisis, it\u2019s a pretty good indicator that the self-healing structures within CLOs is pretty resilient. And so we\u2019re not surprised to see that resilience playing out now. The other interesting thing is when you look at the structure of the loan market today versus the structure of the loan market through the GFC, CLOs currently represent probably 65%-plus of the loan buy in the loan market, which is significantly higher than it was the last go around. And maybe not so obvious, that\u2019s actually created a significant amount of stability because you don\u2019t have frantic selling, which is obviously muting some of the downward pressure on price and just creating overall price and pricing stability in the market. So if you actually look at CLO exposure to the weakest loans in the loan market, they\u2019re underweight relative to the 35% non-CLO buyer, which is actually a pretty good indication both to the credit discipline of the CLO managers themselves, but also kind of the imposed discipline that the structured places on those buyers. There is always, and we\u2019ve talked about this, a risk that with continued downgrades that CCC baskets are triggered and OC tests are triggered, and that has some implications for the structures. But again, even in cases where that happens, they\u2019ll be able to heal themselves. So we\u2019re still quite constructive on CLOs. Obviously, the new issue market has slowed. But for the embedded universe of CLOs, both as a CLO manager and as a buyer of rated and non-rated tranches of other people CLOs, we still see them as very resilient and very durable. Sure. Thanks, Adam. So yes, with regard to Pavonia, as we talked about on our last call, the closing has been delayed, but we\u2019re still optimistic that it will happen in the near future. The good news is because of the structure of that transaction, we\u2019ve been able to do, to your point, all of the pre-work on new product construction, getting the distribution engine ready to turn on when we close that transaction. I think folks are also aware that when we talk about Ares Insurance Solutions and Aspida, it\u2019s not just the organic distribution of the origination business, but there\u2019s a view that we also have an opportunity on the M&A front to grow through acquisition and to build a reinsurance platform alongside the annuities platform. So even though the Pavonia acquisition has delayed all of the work around building the M&A and reinsurance pipeline, it has actually been going quite smoothly and has a lot of momentum. So we\u2019re happy with where that is. And then secondly, as we\u2019ve talked about before, while Pavonia is an important piece of the insurance strategy here at Ares, the insurance strategy is multipronged and includes things like building up our IDF complex, continuing to drive strategic partnerships with insurance companies around certain parts of our private credit business, continuing to distribute product to our insurance clients, and those are all scaling a long time as well. So I would say we\u2019re as bullish as we\u2019ve ever been about the insurance opportunity, and I think we\u2019re executing well. We\u2019re anxious to get our Pavonia deal closed, but it\u2019s not preventing us from making progress in other business. Sure. I\u2019ll give you my view. And then again, Matt or David should be able to give their view. We\u2019re seeing activity pick up. The challenge, I think, that you see in kind of regular way transaction flow putting the public markets aside for a second is when you were dealing with either liquidity challenges or liquidity uncertainty or a lack of earnings visibility. It\u2019s just hard to clear equity, right? The bid-ask spread on equities can be pretty wide as people are trying to figure out what 2020, 2021, 2022 earnings are going to look like. And then two, which is benefiting us on the direct lending and private credit side, availability of debt capital to certain companies and certain assets is constrained in that challenges valuation. So I don\u2019t want to give the impression that we think that there is 0 path toward realization. I just think that we need a little bit more visibility around earnings and liquidity positioning for certain companies to start to get back to a regular type of cadence around transaction flow. But to the public company side, as you mentioned, and that\u2019s why I do think that we\u2019ll have an opportunity, and the AZEK IPO is a perfect example of that, particularly for the non-COVID-type companies, AZEK being one of them making building products, we saw huge investor demand, a really attractive valuation and then an acceleration to valuation post-IPO. So I think that the public markets will continue to be constructive for realizations. I don\u2019t know, Matt, do you want to add any color on top of that? And Mike, I\u2019ll just add, maybe just a quick oversimplification, but I think it\u2019s important is, obviously, when we\u2019re spending on things like travel or entertainment or conferences, all of those things tend to come against incremental fundraising and incremental deployment. So I would even say that anything above Mike\u2019s target would probably come with corollary increase in revenue and would still continue to be accretive to the development of FRE and FRE margin. Yes. I still think we\u2019re going to be able to run the business. Yes, I still expect G&A to kind of run rate when travels back to be in the low-40s quarterly. Sure. Again, a simple question, but not a simple answer just given the breadth of number of funds and strategies on the platform. As you would probably expect prior to launching any new product, we go through a pretty exhaustive strategic and operational review of the product in terms of assessing investor demand, thinking about the operational complexity of the product, the cost to raise it, the cost to run it and, then obviously, the long-term business plan around the products and what that means for the development of FRE and, ultimately, shareholder value of the management company. And that\u2019s a very rigorous process, and not every idea gets through that filter. And I actually think that\u2019s a big part of the evolution of the industry where you learn as you mature that not all AUM is good AUM, and you have to focus on scale of the profitable AUM. And so you are seeing that in places like special opportunities and alternative credit, where we\u2019ve gone out against the business plan, hired 15 to 20 people over a multiyear period, incurred that expense with a very high level of conviction around the business plan. So you did highlight two recent initiatives that you should expect to see some pretty dramatic margin scaling because we\u2019ve already incurred the expense to hire the team, put the process in place, raise the capital, but those funds pay on invested. I think you should expect, given the upcoming fundraise in our European direct lending business, as we talked about in our prepared remarks, even though that business already runs at a pretty healthy mature margin, but just given the scale of that fund, that you\u2019ll see some margin expansion there as well. Real estate, as we\u2019ve talked about historically, is actually running at the lowest business line FRE margin, but it\u2019s growing its FRE margin quicker than other parts of the business. So we are beginning to see the benefits of scale roll through as we\u2019re getting through this most recent fundraise cycle with our U.S. op fund and our value-add funds. So I think you\u2019ll continue to see margin scaling there, but we still have some scaling to do to get to the types of margins that we enjoy in the mature credit and mature PE businesses. So as I was saying, expectations also that, hopefully, SSG will run at a more mature margin just given the size of that business relative to its capital base as well. So strategic partnerships, I\u2019d say, take many forms. And I just want to clarify, we have certain strategic partnerships that are more partnerships around a specific part of the business, whether they\u2019re capital provider or a strategic LP. So a good example of that would be the SDLP unitranche joint venture that we have within ARCC. We then have strategic partnerships, which are bespoke and customized relationships with some of the larger institutional LPs around portions of our business, and that has been a big growth area for us. So when you look at managed accounts as a percentage of our AUM, you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s a pretty healthy number. Those are slower to develop in terms of the sales cycle because it\u2019s not like a commingled fund where you launch a product, set up a data room, do your transactional market and close. It\u2019s much more consultative. It\u2019s much more collaborative. And the whole process is geared toward trying to be a solutions provider for our larger clients. The good news is, as we continue to broaden out the product set, we have a much more robust offering to meet the needs of the clients. And so we are seeing an acceleration in the number of conversations that we have with our LPs. Another thing that we\u2019ve had to do, as we staffed up around that opportunity, is we\u2019ve built out a client strategy and solutions team that\u2019s focused on the entirety of the client experience front to back. And it\u2019s there where we\u2019re working on all of the risk analytics and portfolio modeling to help drive the collaboration around what those relationships could look like. So I can\u2019t be too specific, but it could be someone gives us capital to invest in a global direct lending mandate. It could be that someone says, \"I want you to tactically take advantage of distressed opportunities that you see in these specific industries,\" and it really runs the gamut. And we\u2019re offering ideas to our clients where we see value, and they\u2019re coming to us where they have a need. And you hope that where we see value and where they have a need that there\u2019s an intersection of opportunity. And that\u2019s kind of how we, at a high level, think about driving that part of the business. Sure. Mike, do you want to handle that? Yes. Daniel, there was also a nuance, I don\u2019t know if we can cover it off-line if I don\u2019t do a good job articulating it. But when we work to get the leverage available to BDCs from 1:1 to 2:1, and we restruck the management agreement, we accepted a lower fee above the 1:1 leverage. So the fee steps down, I believe, from 1.5% on assets to 1% for all assets above 1:1 leverage. And ironically, and I don\u2019t think that this was the original intent, so it\u2019s a little bit of a perversion of that original contract intent to align interest with the shareholders as we levered potentially lower ROA assets to drive ROE and growth in the dividend. What happened I think in Q1 and Q2, because it\u2019s an average look back on assets, because of the write down of the assets in the book in Q1, you actually saw leverage go up through the write down of NAV as opposed to the leveraging of the balance sheet through incremental debt. And so as a result, to Mike\u2019s point, you had a little bit of a hit because the gross assets were lower and then you had a modest hit because you triggered the 1% above the 1:1 leverage for assets that, in the prior quarter, were actually operating below the 1:1 because of the NAV. So as NAV improves, which it did this quarter, and we expect it will continue to, and as deployment continues, and as Kipp talked about on the call yesterday, we have about $4 billion of available liquidity at ARCC, we\u2019d expect to see that fee continue as it was. I can\u2019t I\u2019m not going to go into specifics on the business plan yet. But as we execute, I think we\u2019ll come back and we\u2019ll be able to articulate the initiatives that we\u2019ve executed on with them, and you guys can see what the impact is. We\u2019re still in the early days. But as we talked about when we announced the partnership, we have been working through a pipeline of strategic opportunities to leverage their balance sheet, both in existing businesses and new businesses, and we\u2019re executing well against that. So we\u2019ve had already a number of situations where they\u2019ve made large capital contributions into various portfolios and business launches that, we think, will be accretive, either because we\u2019re launching businesses at the management company or because they\u2019re providing creative and efficient financing solutions into some of our funds and some of our subsidiaries. So stay tuned for that. But as we continue to execute, I think we\u2019re going to have some pretty good examples to share with all of you. The second piece, which we talked about, which will take a little bit more time, was just thinking long term and strategically about the distribution opportunity for alternative product in Japan. I think it\u2019s as we talked about in prior calls, now that we have SSG and we have a broader product set in region to complement our U.S. and European offering, I think that, that distribution partnership potential has improved. And then third, we\u2019ve talked a little bit just about capital markets collaboration and ways to work together given the size of their balance sheet and the size of our capital base and relationships to drive value. That also is going to take some time, but I\u2019m still optimistic. So stay tuned on it, but without getting into the details, we\u2019ve already made significant progress, and they followed through pretty helpfully with the capital commitments that we expected here in the first couple of months that I mentioned. Thanks, operator. We don\u2019t have any other than I want to reiterate that we hope that everybody stays safe and well, and that\u2019s true for you and yours. And I just want to thank everybody at Ares for the incredible work. I don\u2019t think anybody on this call, whether it\u2019s Ares or elsewhere, has fully appreciated what it would take to continue to drive our businesses forward in their remote environment. And when you look at these results and the amount of work that went into it, I just wanted to make sure that we thank everybody, again, for all the hard work to continue to deliver these types of outcomes. So I hope everybody enjoys the end of summer and look forward to catching up on next quarter\u2019s call."

Please refer to our first quarter earnings presentation available on the Investor Resources section of our website for reconciliations of the measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Please note nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Ares Fund. This morning, we announced that we declared our second quarter common dividend of $0.40 per share, representing an increase of 25% over our prior year\u2019s quarterly dividend. The dividend will be paid on June 30, 2020 to holders of record on June 16, 2020. We also declared our quarterly preferred dividend of $0.4375 per Series A preferred share, which is payable on June 30, 2020 to holders of record on June 15. Now, I will turn the call over to Michael Arougheti who will start with some quarterly financial and business highlights.\nMichael Arougheti: Thank you, Carl and good afternoon everyone. We wish everyone well during these unprecedented and difficult times and our thoughts are with those who have been affected by this crisis. We want to thank the first responders, healthcare professionals and those on the frontlines risking their lives for our communities across the globe. I also want to thank all of our employees here at Ares who are working harder than ever to drive our company forward through this challenge. It\u2019s really been remarkable to see the seamless transition our entire firm has made to working remotely and we are functioning at full capacity. I could not be more proud of the team. It\u2019s also nice to see so many of our portfolio companies directly supporting our communities whether it\u2019s DuPage Medical, which is running the clinical operations for COVID Triage Center in Chicago\u2019s McCormick Convention Center and delivering high-quality and safe care for non-COVID patients throughout the shelter-in-place period or convergent technologies, as an example, delivering solutions to enhance health security through thermal cameras, contactless access controls and identity management and tracking software. With respect to Ares, I am going to spend a few minutes on why we believe that we are uniquely positioned to navigate this period both offensively and defensively. Our team at Ares is broad, deep and has worked together for a long time, including through past economic cycles. And as we have demonstrated consistently during our tenure, we are very experienced at navigating different and challenging economic environments. As many of you know, we grew faster through the GFC than in any 2 year period since then with AUM and management fees increasing at compounded annual growth rates of 39% and 28% respectively from 2007 to 2009. So, what we are all witnessing now is unique in many respects? Our framework for navigating and responding to crisis is well established and it centers first and foremost around our culture of collaboration. Information, ideas and market insights flow across our platform through both recurring committee meetings, town halls, working groups and nimble point-to-point and cross-team interactions. This has enabled us to navigate the early days of this crisis extraordinarily well. We have also had 8 weeks of cross portfolio company calls to ensure that we are sharing best practices on employee and public health issues, technology, government and regulatory matters, supply chain management, ESG, etcetera. This all exemplifies what you often hear us refer to as the power of our platform, which supports exploring ideas and solving problems and pursuing opportunities across our businesses, geographies and our controlled portfolio of companies. Now more than ever, we are relying on our collaborative culture to deliver optimal outcomes for all of our stakeholders. Our first quarter marked several financial milestones that Mike will cover in further detail. Our results also reflect our resilient and cycle tested model. The first quarter was our 12th consecutive quarter of sequential fee-related earnings growth, with FRE of $93.1 million, an increase of 31% from the same period last year. In addition to reporting record FRE, the first quarter was also a new record for management fees, a new record FRE margin since going public, record fee paying AUM which crossed $100 billion for the first time in our history and our second highest realized income. In addition, fundraising is off to a very strong start with over $6.6 billion raised during the quarter. I do want to highlight certain key characteristics of our business that not only supported strong first quarter results, but also positioned us well going forward. First, we have a management fee centric business model, with most of our revenue coming from management fees that are primarily generated from permanent capital vehicles and long-dated closed end fund structures. We experienced limited capital outflows and our management fees are generally well insulated for mark-to-market fluctuations as we saw this past quarter. This provides us great visibility to growing fee-related earnings and dividends. Second, in addition to managing long-dated and permanent capital, we have always had a bias towards structuring funds and other mandates could be as flexible as possible. This allows us to invest between liquid and illiquid strategies across capital structures and to pivot between regular way investing and special opportunities or distressed investing during periods of volatility. Third, we tend to run our funds with a significant amount of dry powder and generally begin raising successor funds when predecessor funds are about 60% to 70% deployed. We went into the crisis with significant available capital to invest and we ended the first quarter with approximately $33 billion of dry powder. Next, similar type of fund level, we also believe in maintaining significant excess liquidity at the management company and we run a balance sheet light model. For many reasons, we have never aspired to have a large balance sheet that takes outsized positions and investments. Instead, we have pursued a balance sheet strategy that focuses on activities intended to grow our core earnings. Our balance sheet is strong with available liquidity of over $1.4 billion, no near-term debt maturities, no net leverage and no leverage with mark-to-market or similar attributes that would ever require us having to meet margin calls or other fundings. Our liquidity position us well to capitalize on potential strategic growth opportunities that this market should present to us. And last, our net realized performance fees are primarily driven by realizations from our closed end funds. Our long-term locked up capital means that we are not forced sellers of assets and while valuations can move up or down, they reflect unrealized estimated fair value at any point in time and are not necessarily reflective of where we would or expect to monetize investments in our funds in the future. On a related note, our capital base is meaningfully over-weighted to more resilient credit-based strategies that invest at the top of the capital structure and by definition take the last loss on investment. Not only this credit provide more stability in values, but it is also easier and quicker to deploy in volatile markets when equity risk is more difficult to price. Now, turning to the markets, we expect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to impact the economy in three general phases and I will discuss how Ares has responded or plans to respond in each phase. In the first phase, beginning in early March and continuing through the end of the first quarter, we witnessed severe disruption in market prices. It began with the equity markets, led into the high yield and leveraged loan markets and then across the spectrum of almost all risk assets, including the private markets. The healthcare crisis and government shutdowns triggered almost immediate impacts to the liquidity of businesses and the disruption impacting nearly every company to varying degrees. Fortunately, as a percent of our firm-wide AUM, we have relatively small exposure to the \u201cground-zero\u201d industries, most heavily impacted assets, such as oil and gas, travel and leisure and retail, but we are certainly not immune. In this first phase, we focused on doing everything we could to understand the liquidity needs of our portfolio companies and to protect value in the existing book. On the investing front, we began actively using our dry powder to invest in and trade to stressed assets, while retaining significant dry powder to what we believe it would be a long drawn-out recessionary environment. In the second phase where we believe we are now, significant fiscal and monetary stimulus has been announced and it is timing it\u2019s away into the markets and the economy, albeit in some cases unevenly and slowly. Following this massive fiscal and monetary response, there has been a meaningful rally in the public equity and credit markets, which began in late March. But we would argue that the recent performance in many markets is at odds with the current fundamental economic reality. Liquidity has not yet reached certain segments effectively and a significant need for rescue capital and liquidity remains across the private markets. This period of stagnation could be with us for this foreseeable future and it could result in an extended period of continued market volatility due to the depth of demand shock on our consumer-driven economy. This market environment plays into our strong relationships across the private markets of North America, Europe and soon to be Asia. In general, we are focused on providing rescue capital primarily to high-quality second order impact companies or those companies not in the most affected industries. We continue to find some attractive opportunities in the liquid markets as well. And in the third phase, once the significant percentage of the working population is fully back to work, we expect to return to \u201cnew normal\u201d market environment. We would then envision a prolonged period with less competition where we will be able to invest in great companies and assets at attractive values. Importantly, we believe that our flexible strategy with the ability to invest in the liquid and illiquid assets using our deep research and private markets expertise works well in all stages. Our investment strategy flexes to a particular market environment, which is why we strive in so many diverse environments of our company\u2019s history. Many of you have access about fund raising in this environment. The good new is that we have continued our fundraising momentum even after the outbreak of the pandemic. For example, 5 of our commingled funds together closed on more than $2 billion of capital in the month of March. And then during April and into early May, we have received additional inflows of approximately $2 billion across strategies and our credit, private equity and real estate groups. We continue to expect the strong fundraising year in 2020. Our past success has been driven in part by expanding relationships to our existing clients through re-ups into larger existing strategies and new capital into other Ares strategies. Historically, existing investors have accounted for 70% to 80% of our fundraising each year since our IPO. The first quarter was no exception as our direct fundraising from existing investors accounted for 74% of our total quarterly fundraising. This puts us in an adventitious competitive position in the current virtual environment as LPs in general are more focused on re-ups to existing funds or new commitments to existing managers rolling out these funds. We are fortunate to be in a position with a large number of successor funds, coupled with some actionable new funds that can invest well in this market environment. Some of our best performing fund vintages were raised and deployed during the last global financial crisis and I think investors recognize the attractive investment opportunities that can arise during periods of significant volatility. As discussed in our call in February, we have at least 8 large successor funds and new commingled funds either in the market, pre-launch or to be launched within the next 6 to 12 months. This includes our special opportunities fund, or 6 corporate private equity fund, 2 real estate private equity funds, our alternative credit flagship funds, our 5th European direct leading fund, our second junior capital private credit fund, and our second U.S. senior direct lending funds. Altogether, these represent at least $25 billion of incremental targeted capital, all in strategies and formats that can actively take advantage of the current and future distressed markets. Our fundraising efforts will also continue with our strategic managed accounts and strategic partnerships, our public funds, smaller commingled funds and other closed end vehicles. We are making significant fundraising progress on our funds that are in the market, many of which are also seeing expanded investment opportunity set as a result of the current market dislocation. Our special opportunities fund, which focuses on illiquid and liquid distressed investing, including rescue capital investments, has resonated even more with investors in the current market. With that in mind, we have closed on approximately $3 billion for this fund, which well exceeds the fund\u2019s target of $2 billion. The special opportunities team has been actively deploying capital with $1 billion invested since the inception split about half in privately negotiating and half in secondary distressed investments, most of which was invested in the last 60 days. We are also nearing a meaningful first close to our 6 flexible capital private equity funds. As a reminder, our flexible capital private equity strategy pivots primarily between the stressed investment and prudently leveraged by our investing. Not surprisingly in the current environment, the team is focused almost exclusively on distressed investing and we believe that there is a significant opportunity for this fund to invest in high-quality companies that had issues with their balance sheets and/or our need of liquidity from the financial sponsor such as Ares that can help them chart a path back to growth. In the midst of the dislocation, we also held additional closings for our U.S. opportunistic real estate PE fund, bringing the total raise to-date of $1.1 billion against the target of $1.5 billion. This strategy also has a focus on buying stressed high-quality real estate assets. We also held the first closing of more than \u20ac500 million through our European value add real estate PE fund and our real estate debt funds continued fundraising with another $400 million inflows during the first quarter. We have seen strong interest in our flagship alternative credit fund. This fund pursues an opportunistic strategy focused on asset-oriented investments. Given the current market disruption, this strategy\u2019s opportunity set was meaningfully expanded and the size of the investment pipeline materially increased post COVID-19. This fund also includes an innovative feature that allocates at least 10% of the fund\u2019s performance fee to global health and global education charities. This fund was launched last year prior to the global health crisis and has always contained this profit sharing in charitable mission. The fund closed on $786 million in March and total capital raised to-date stands at approximately $1.3 billion. We expect to hit or exceed our target of $2 billion in the near future. Also, we just launched our 5th European direct leading fund this week. Based on our leadership position and the opportunities set in European direct lending, we currently expect that this fund could be the largest private commingled fund in our company\u2019s history. The other credit funds that I mentioned are expected to be launched later in the year or early in 2021. So, as you can see, we expect a significant fundraising year despite the challenges that some investors face. During the full first quarter, our drawdown funds invested more than $4 billion, mostly across our credit platform and direct lending and alternative credit as we focused off the balance sheet in high-quality credits and assets. With the extreme volatility in the first quarter, we were also very active trading in the liquid markets, where the stress and dislocation were most prevalent. Post the COVID outbreak we treaded approximately $5 billion in liquids securities in March, an increase of more than 50% year-over-year bringing total trading volumes to over $11 billion in the quarter. This represents a 30% increase in the first quarter of last year and highlights our ability to take advantage of these market dislocations. Some of the best investment opportunities right now have pivoted into the private markets where our sourcing advantages can play an even greater roll. It is now important once again to use our relationships to gain access to the highest quality opportunities for companies needing rescue capital or critical financing for acquisitions in market segments less impacted by the disruption. We expect deployment to pickup pace throughout the year with a focus across our credit, distressed, rescue capital, alternative credit and opportunistic real estate businesses. Investments spreads and structures have markedly improved across the credit landscape as many competitors and banks are not open for business, which we believe will position us to boost future returns. And from a performance standpoint, our Q1 fund performance across our credit, PE and real estate strategies naturally reflects the significant disruption that occurred in March. On a positive note, our funds generally exceeded their relevant public market indices. Our private equity composite was down 9.3%. Our European and U.S. real estate private equity strategies declined between 3.5% and 4.2% respectively and our credit strategies declined anywhere from 11.8% and 12.2% on the liquids side to between 0.4% and 7.7% on the direct lending side in our significant funds. Importantly, our investors are patient and they measure our fund performance over much longer time periods and on a realized basis. Of course, the market volatility that impacted our fund values also may provide opportunities for us to make long-term investments at more interesting entry points. And maybe lastly before I hand the call over to Mike, I want to provide some updates on certain of our recently announced strategic activities. As many of you saw, we formalized a strategic partnership with Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp in late March. We had a longstanding mutually rewarding relationship with SMBC and we had been discussing the potential for strategic partnership for over a year. Through this partnership, we expect to gain strategic distribution in the Japanese market with their broad client base and we can also partner with their significant balance sheet to help us grow existing and to launch new businesses. We expect a meaningful earnings contribution from the partnership synergies over time. We also aligned interest around the partnership through a sale of 4.9% of our common equity to SMBC, which we believe will be accretive over the long-term. While the timing coincided with the early days of the crisis, it\u2019s our view that this capital is even more valuable than it would have been before. This equity capital puts us in a position to play offense in this opportunistic investment environment, where we can hopefully scale our business in areas that are highly strategic for us. Second, our SSG Capital transaction is proceeding smoothly and we now expect the closing in late June or early July with approximately $6 billion in AUM. We are very excited to bring onboard a leading secured and special opportunities investor in the pan-Asian region at a time where we expect it to be very opportunistic to invest. Similar to us, they continue to have uninterrupted fundraising. Third, I wanted to provide an update on our insurance solutions initiative, which as you know, we call Aspida Financial. We expect to close the platform acquisition of Pavonia Life in the second quarter or early third quarter and there are many interesting acquisition opportunities in the insurance sector and we have been building a pipeline of reinsurance transactions as well. After closing, we will soon be prepared to rollout our life insurance and annuity products in an environment that will be more advantageous than before as retirees continue to struggle to find quality investment alternatives and insurance products in the current volatile and low interest rate environment. And now with that, I am going to turn the call over to Mike McFerran for his remarks on our business positioning and more detail on our financial results. Mike?\nMichael McFerran: Thank you, Mike. Hello, everyone and thank you for joining our call today. No words can do justice to explain the extraordinary and tragic nature of what\u2019s transpired in recent months and I hope all of you are safe and well. While we are doing this call from our respective offsite locations and I miss the in-person interaction with my colleagues. I will echo Mike\u2019s comments by saying that the power of our platform with a culture deeply rooted in collaboration has never been more evident or valuable than it is right now. While our global team continues to work remotely, our culture combined with our truly incredible technology and operations teams have a highly \u2013 operating highly effectively from our various locations. I will start my remarks with some key points in the quarter and then provide a more comprehensive review of our results and financial position. As Mike highlighted, the first quarter represented our 12th consecutive quarter of fee-related earnings growth and reflected some key first time milestones with fee-related earnings, exceeding $90 million, our margin growing to a new high of 34% and our fee-paying assets under management exceeding $100 billion. Valuations across most if not all asset classes globally have been negatively impacted our portfolios were not immune to the broad market dislocation as reduced valuations decreased our net accrued carry from yearend levels and reduce the value of our balance sheet portfolio. Although valuations were down as Mike stated our funds exceeded their public benchmark indices across our credit private equity and real estate strategies. Notwithstanding the challenging market backdrop realization stemming primarily from our private equity and real estate businesses enabled us to report $134.1 million of a realized income for the quarter which is our second highest quarter reported realized income since our IPO in 2014. Now I will take you through the results in more detail. Fee-related earnings for the quarter totaled $93.1 million, an increase of 31%from the first quarter of 2019 I will also note that this represents an increase of 5% for the last quarter which translates into a 20% annualized growth rate quarter over quarter. We are off to a good start to the year and I will reiterate our expectation that we expect to grow fee related earnings year over year by 15% or more. Fee-related earnings growth is driven by 17% of management fee growth from the prior year period compared to growth and combined compensation and general and administrative expenses of 12%. The faster growth of management fees versus expenses reflects the nature and life cycle of our revenue model the majority of our AUM from closed-end funds pays fees and deployed capital however we incur expenses on our capital raising investing and operating activities before we achieve rent revenue ramp as we are deploying the capital which is reflected in a AUM not yet paying fees or shadow AUM in other words we are growing management fees while much of the expense related to that revenue has already been reflected our prior financials. This enables us to continue to grow our margins which is highlighted by our FRE margin growing to 34% from 32% for the fourth quarter of last year and 30% for the for the first quarter of 2019. I do want to highlight that we are reiterating the 2020 margin guidance. We gave our call last quarter which is that we expect to report a 34% margin for the year and we would continue to expect to achieve a 35% or better run rate margin during 2020. With respect to general administrative expenses this quarter\u2019s results include approximately $3.3 million of expenses related to the ongoing SEC matter we discussed last quarter related to certain compliance policies and procedures. We believe this accounts for all the expenses we will incur related to this matter in our second quarter results were reflected insurance recovery of 2.5 million which offsets most of the expenses we recognize this quarter. Notwithstanding this we are seeing reduced G&A expenses as a result of the current environment most notably from reduced travel expenses. We do expect that through growing operational synergies including benefits we are capturing from our technology investments and from our Mumbai office that we opened last year that our full year 2020 G&A expenses should be flat or below the aggregate $178.7 million that we reported for 2019. Realized income for the quarter totaled $134.1 million which represents an increase of $29.5 million or 28% as compared to the first quarter of 2019. After-tax realized income per Class A common share, net of preferred stock distributions was $0.45 for the first quarter, an increase of 28% from the first quarter of 2019. On last quarter\u2019s call we highlighted that we estimate our 2020 effective tax rates to be in a 15% to 18% range for realized income and then the 11% to 8% range on fee related earnings assuming 100% of our shares were converted to Class A common basis we still think these estimates are appropriate for 2020. With respect to net performance income realizations going forward, we have moved from a general market backdrop that was favorable for realizations to one that is not at least for the near term. While there still will be opportunities for realized income to exceed fee related earnings this year current and anticipated market conditions for the foreseeable future are clearly far more conducive to making investments to grow long term value as opposed to harvesting gains today. Realizations during the first quarter combined with downward fair value adjustments as of March 31 did reduce our net accrued performance fees to $235.5 million at quarter end from $348.2 million as of December 31, 2019. Given our FRE centric business model, fluctuations in performance-related income have a minimal impact in our financial and liquidity position that do not affect our dividend, which as you know is pegged to FRE. Next, let me spend a few minutes in our AUM related metrics. Our AUM at March 31 totaled $148.6 billion compared to $148.9 billion at December 31. This is an increase of 9% from the prior year. AUM this quarter benefited from new capital commitments totaling $6.6 billion and our acquisition of CLO management contract agreements totaling $2.7 billion, which were offset by $5.7 billion of market value depreciation at $3.7 billion of distributions from income and realizations by our funds during the quarter. Going forward, we do expect AUM to be partially bolstered by the muted pace of realizations throughout the year. Our fee-paying AUM increased to over 17% year-over-year as a meaningful amount of our AUM has been converted to fee-paying AUM upon investment. We ended the first quarter with a $102 billion of fee-paying AUM, which is a great milestone as it represents the first time in our history that we have exceeded over $100 billion of fee-paying AUM. We ended the quarter with available capital of $33.2 billion, representing approximately 22% of our AUM as of quarter end and had $23.1 billion of AUM not yet paying fees, of which approximately $21 billion is available for future deployment with corresponding annual management fees totaling $199.8 million. The last metric I wanted to cover is incentive eligible AUM, which totaled $84.5 billion at quarter end. Of this amount, $22.4 billion was incentive generating at $25.9 billion was un-invested at quarter end. Well, asset price declines in the quarter reduced our accrued net performance fees as I previously referenced. We believe we are uniquely positioned to create meaningful long-term value for future performance fees. The combination of our dry powder are broad and diversified proprietary investment sourcing capabilities, the flexible nature of our funds, and most importantly, our culture that is deeply rooted in collaboration has us well positioned in this environment to make investments patiently in the quarters ahead that we believe will be a source of long-term performance fee generation in the years ahead. Before handing the call back to Mike, I do want to address our financial position as of quarter end. We ended the quarter with nearly $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents in our balance sheet with $800 million drawn against our $1.1 billion revolving credit facility due in 2025. This gives us more than $1.4 billion of available capital and quality as Mike mentioned. Subsequent to quarter end, we elected to reduce our borrowings and our revolver to $500 million. And after this pay down, we continue to have in excess of $850 million in cash on our balance sheet. We sit here today very well capitalized with no net debt, no near term debt maturities and no mark-to-market balance sheet leverage. We are very well equipped to be nimble and strategically focused to pursue what we believe will be a broad set of unusual opportunities to leverage our capital for growth in the time periods ahead. With that, I wish all of you and your families and loved ones, health and safety in this difficult time. I will hand the call back to Mike.\nMichael Arougheti: Thanks Mike. So in conclusion, we believe that our business model not only resilient, but also well positioned to thrive in what we expect will be a continued volatile market environment. Our management fee centric model rooted in credit and flexible strategies coupled with our balance sheet light model and strong balance sheet puts us in a strong position to navigate these times. It is during these volatile periods that we believe our organization and the power of our platform rise to the occasion and shine through. We don\u2019t view this as being an economic cycle, where we will simply snapback to yesterday anytime soon, rather we project a long U shaped recovery and with that an unusual and interesting period ahead with its share of challenges, but also ensured unique investment opportunities. It\u2019s in times like these that having investment sourcing, underwriting and portfolio management capabilities are critical and having brought access to capital is key. And to survive, but not just survive, but to succeed you need to be well positioned with both and we believe that we are. I echo Mike's comments and wishing everyone safety and health. I look forward to updating you on our progress on next quarter's call and I'd also like to end by thanking the entire team one last time for all their hard work and dedication these last couple of weeks as always we appreciate your time and support for the company and your time today. And with that operator, we would like to open up a lot of questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Robert Lee with KBW. Please go ahead.\nRobert Lee: Great. Thanks guys. I hope everyone is doing well in this challenging environment.\nMichael Arougheti: Good. How are you Rob?\nRobert Lee: Yes thank you maybe just Mike, appreciate all the comments on fundraising, but maybe going back to that a little bit you have a lot of things still in process but could you may be give a little more granular color just on how maybe the timing or pace may be impacted versus kind of what you would have thought on the fourth quarter call may be particularly around kind of some of the larger funds, the funds? Does it feel like it going to take an extra couple of quarters or feels like given your flexible mandate, it could happen as quickly as you originally thought? \nMichael Arougheti: Yes. As of now everything is closing kind of as originally scheduled at target size and as you heard in the prepared remarks we've actually been pleased in certain situations like our special opportunities fund and our alternative credit fund where we have actually seen accelerated fund raising just given that those strategies are particularly well suited for the current environment and so as we sit here today we are not actually seeing any change in terms of the pacing obviously that could change as we get deeper into this as investors are doing with things like denominator fact and challenges of working remotely but as of now we're not we're not forecasting that.\nRobert Lee: Needed a follow-up on that, I mean, you did touch on with kind of re-ups being a focal point or do you get a sense that investors are re-upping at may be higher levels than you originally thought just given the environment on your strategies?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes I mean as we said we had 8 funds that are in the market are soon to come to market totaling over $25 billion that all can invest well into distress. And so I think our investors have a pretty nice selection of strategies to choose from to try to take advantage of the current dislocation I think the reupps and we talked about this on prior calls pre crisis there was an over arching trend of larger managers taking more wallet share I think that's accelerating now. Obviously, it's easier for an LP to underwrite an existing manager. There are also some nuances where certain investors actually need face to face meetings by our regs and so I think if you are an existing manager with a good track record and a deep relationship with just a lot easier particularly remotely to focus on a reupp so we are actually seeing some of that getting reflecting in larger commitments on reup which I think is just a reflection of people maybe allocating more to some of the larger existing managers than the new funds.\nRobert Lee: Great. Thank you for taking my questions.\nMichael Arougheti: Thanks Rob.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nKen Worthington: Hi good morning or good afternoon depending on where you are on. In the discussion of the three phases of investments opportunities you indicated less competition in Phase 3, can you flush out those comments on the competitive landscapes competitive landscape with regard to the banks to what extent maybe where you were seeing banks as a bigger competitor and how you think or what makes you think the pull back in the banks as competitors will last here and to what extent of any other government programs actually accelerating or might accelerate the bank sort of return as competitors? Thanks.\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. Thanks for the question. Ken. So, just to clarify the comment, it wasn\u2019t really geared just towards competition from banks, I think there is more broader comment just about what the competitors set will look like on the back end of this and what we have seen in every cycle that we have managed through as a consolidation of market share and market position coming through financial crisis. So, we would expect to see reduced competition and reduced liquidity in the hands of competitors across the entire competitive set. That would be consistent with our past experience and consistent with what we are seeing in the market now. With regard to the banks, obviously, we don\u2019t compete directly with them, but for in certain segments of our direct lending business, particularly the higher end of size range of potential borrowers needless to say in this environment while we are still active, the banks are not active underwriting and syndicating leveraged finance product. I think as importantly you saw this world through some corners of the market before the stimulus was put forward and it\u2019s actually still happening in certain segments of the market, where there are margin facilities or repo lines or swap facilities that banks have been moving to get liquid as I think most investors are. And we have seen a reduced appetite to commit new capital across the board from the banks. So, I would characterize the bank behavior more as what we are seeing in terms of lending liquidity providers into the market versus lending head-to-head competitors with us. And so for the last 20 years I think people have been asking us about bank competition returning in the potential impact on our business. We historically have not really competed head-to-head and I don\u2019t expect that to change. With regard to the government programs, oops sorry go ahead. \nKen Worthington: No, no I was going to thank you for that, but please continue.\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. I think the question was around government programs and whether that would catalyze increased competition from the banks and I think just similar comment is no. I think the banks are obviously very busy managing their existing exposures the same way that we and others are and then obviously busy from policy mandate executing on the government loan program. But we don\u2019t expect their purchase patient in those programs to somehow change their competitive position relative to us.\nKen Worthington: Okay, thank you. It makes sense. And then in the deck, assets in intensive generating AUM fell for obvious reasons, what sort of returns do you need on the credit side for those assets to fall back into that incentive generating territory? Is it could be a basis point, could be 10%, is there a more narrow range that we could see a lot of those assets return back to incentive generating?\nMichael Arougheti: So, on the asset side, declining credit or fell out of incentive generating, most of that were consisted of pretty much separate accounts or more strategic separate accounts that are for lack of a better term earlier in their lifecycles, these are all accounts that start deploying capital. So, while they fell below the pref returns, they not far underneath them and again they are also deploying capital and they are all European style waterfront. We don\u2019t think it changes the overall outlook for those. We think its bit of a function especially again when you think about IRR math earlier days of funds. It\u2019s little more volatile to cash activity valuations.\nKen Worthington: Great.\nMichael Arougheti: I would say, Ken, as a general rule and it depends on the strategy, it\u2019s probably somewhere between 2.5% and 4% on the high end in terms of math build. So to Mike\u2019s point of view, you wanted to put a number behind it. It\u2019s very, very low single digit.\nKen Worthington: Great. Thank you for the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDean Stephan: Hey, this is Dean Stephan on for Mike Carrier. Just in terms of portfolio of companies and investments, can you just provide an update on maybe your energy exposure and other sectors most impacted for just travel and leisure? Maybe what you guys are doing to support these companies and any other areas of the portfolio you actually view as more defensive in this type of environment?\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. You have to \u2013 we kind of look at AUM across the entire platform as we talked about, firm-wide AUM is kind of the best way that we can think about exposures and are waiting. In terms of retail exposures broadly, about 1.5% \u2013 1.7% of the firm\u2019s AUM is invested in some part of the retail landscape, travel and leisure, broadly speaking, which includes things like gaming and may include some aerospace that\u2019s probably an inflated representation, because they are not all directly impacted, it\u2019s about 3.5% of our AUM and energy is in and around 3%, but of that, only about 1% is actually in oil and gas exploration with the remainder being in renewable energy and midstream infrastructure. So will I leave it to you to decide how you want to differentiate between kind of the upstream and midstream? But if you were to look at those exposures, relative to public indices, they are meaningfully underweight. And when you look at those exposures relative to any specific funds, they are underweight as well. So, as an example, in our real estate business, we have no hotel exposure in any of our significant real estate funds. In fact, we have actually sold a big portfolio of hotel investments over the last 18 months. So, I think it\u2019s hard to be completely un-invested in these parts of the market, but we are underweight and where we are invested, it\u2019s pretty well distributed across the platform. So, it\u2019s not going to impact any single fund.\nDean Stephan: Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And then just as a follow-up given the active deployment in the quarter, can you just touch on maybe a little more detail areas of the market, where you are seeing the most attractive opportunities? And then if and how those opportunities are involving kind of given the recent market rally?\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. And we have got a bunch of our senior PMs on the line. So I may ask them to provide a little bit of color, but going back to the framework of the different phases we are obviously quite busy in the first phase in the liquid markets before the stimulus came and provided a backdrop of support. So, when you look at our deployment through March, it was largely buying assets in the secondary markets as we are now transitioning into Phase 2. We pivoted into the private markets. And as we said in the prepared remarks, the bulk of what we are doing there is providing rescue capital to companies that need a liquidity bridge or want to buy \u201cinsurance\u201d to play offense in this market similar to the way that we have thought about running our own company, but maybe just to give it a little bit of color, I will ask Scott Graves who runs our special ops business and then maybe Joel on AltCredit just to give a little bit of a flavor for how they are playing it. So, I think it will help you better understand where the opportunities are.\nScott Graves: Sure. Thanks Mike. This is Scott Graves. We look at the world on a relative value basis across Ares and compare what we can achieve in the public market versus the opportunities available in the private market. And to give a little bit of color to what Mike said, you know March traded down faster than any cycle that we have seen or invested in. It traded down faster than \u201808, it traded down faster than \u201801, it traded down faster than the early 90s cycle. It was on pace with the Great Depression of the late 1920s and beginning of the 30s. That shock in the market presented terrific opportunities, significant liquidity, significant opportunity to buy marketable securities what we thought were very attractive prices generally focused on the top of the capital structure through the stimulus plan that came the week of March 23 and right around April 9. We have seen a bounce in the public markets. And certainly with the view toward almost 2,000 portfolio companies at Ares, it feels like the opportunity set in the public markets has been muted and we are shifting to the private market. What\u2019s different about this cycle is that this is going to be a liquidity driven cycle. Companies are seeing a significant shock to both their revenue line, as well as their cost structure and they will need access to incremental forms of capital in order to get through and the strongest companies and more attractive companies, we are focusing on will also find ways to put capital to work offense to take share, consolidate, make high return on invested capital based decisions. And that\u2019s where we are focused. Our backlog of private opportunities across the firm is as rich as it\u2019s ever been and we really look forward to partnering with companies and management teams to provide them capital to get through this troubling time and to also strengthen their business as they think about how to improve coming out of the back end.\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, Scott. It\u2019s Mike. I think it\u2019s a good point maybe just about the sourcing, because we mentioned in the prepared remarks, but having an embedded portfolio close to 2,000 companies putting aside the number of marketable securities that we track puts us in a unique position to offer these types of solutions either into the existing portfolio or into companies that we have diligence before, but not invested in. So, it does allow us to pivot very quickly into the private markets like few people can. Joel, one \u2013 do want to maybe Joel, quickly on the Alternative Credit side, which I think is probably what we are seeing some of the most acute liquidity shock just a quick overview to some of things that we are focusing on there.\nJoel Holsinger: Sure. Thanks, Mike. This is Joel Holsinger. Yes, I think there were small windows across alternative credit in the liquid markets. And if you think of what we do in Alternative Credit, a lot of tools, there is loans, receivables and underlying leases and we do lending on the basics as well as rescue as well as asset opportunity and then the liquid markets. And what we are seeing similar to what Scott saw was there was short windows where there was opportunities to buy stuff in the secondary market in the liquid, but where we are seeing the biggest opportunity or the lack of a better term semi-liquid opportunities. Their opportunities were created by the liquidity shock from mark-to-market and repo financing where with the downdraft that 3 or 4 weeks ago, they have created a lot of longer lasting pain across both other credit type funds as well as some of the mortgage rates you have seen in the news. And we have been very active in those opportunities and what you will see is the opportunities we are seeing there are large. So, there is a short lift of people that they can go to be able to solve some of their issues and we just closed on the deal couple of weeks ago, it was $350 million that was effectively taking out a mark-to-market repo financing where they had it advanced at a much higher advance rate in the very low cost to capital, 2% to 3% cost of capital, so something from our standpoint, where we brought them a private solution and where 15% to 20% type IRRs but on a more term permanent type basis. And I think it\u2019s reflective of the opportunity set where you have to have the ability in the power of the platform to be able to do size and bring the solution to the table. So they are still directly sourced and bilateral type transactions, but lot of it is coming out of the pain that\u2019s occurring from the swift downturn of the liquidity of liquid markets.\nDean Stephan: Thanks, Joel.\nMichael Arougheti: Dean, probably maybe more color than you have argued for, but I always think it helps bring the opportunity into life. So, thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next call or question will come from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thanks for taking my question. Hope you are all doing well.\nMichael Arougheti: Thank you, Craig.\nCraig Siegenthaler: I have a two-parter on fee related earnings. First the CLO subordinated fees can you explain how they are calculated and what could trigger Ares to defer these fees like we saw from Carlyle in the first quarter? And the second part, can you remind us how ARCC or BDC calculate its incentive fees Part 1s and what could cause these fees to be deferred too? Thank you.\nMichael Arougheti: I will start with the first part of that, Craig. Hope you are well. On the CLOs, the sub fees if you think about a CLO waterfall, you have \u2013 really, there is two fee components on the recurring management fees. There is a senior fee, which literally sits at top and is actually senior to the AAA bonds. And then you have a subordinate fee which depending on the deal is somewhere closer to the bottom. Our deals are structured similar but a little different and a little more conservative than others in the market in so much as our blend of fees is approximately 50-50 between senior fees and the sub fees in CLO\u2019s so a higher percentage of our CLO management fees comes from the senior fees than you usually expect used to seeing. And second, our sub fees, for I'd say, almost three quarters of our deals are usually senior to at least one of the OC tests or an interest diversion test. As far as what it means from an FRE perspective, maybe just kind of compartmentalize is the size of it to us. CLO sub fees again represent about half our fees from CLO\u2019s and that amount was I think about 3 just maybe just over 3% this quarter call it 3.3%. So just over $9 million so when we think about the diversion risk as we ended the quarter all of our CLO\u2019s were passing all their OC tests again we don\u2019t want to comment another managers I think CLO\u2019s are different as far as structure to some extent and how they manage are different some CLO\u2019s are managed ROE 2 rating and picking the highest return points with invading spectrums whereas we similar to everything else we do at Ares have a very fundamental credit focused approach to the portfolio of CLO\u2019s I think that enables them to be more conservatively positioned But if I were to think about kind of a draconian scenario whereas some CLO\u2019s were to start failing our OC tests based on what we saw on the financial crisis and how we stressed it I think to see may be kind of a more of a dire scenario say up to half the deals failing for one to two quarters which for us you would think about as being one I think that\u2019s probably worst than we saw during the great financial crisis of 08, 09 but for us to be an impact on management fees that\u2019s for all practical purposes to minimize so I feel pretty good again about the CLO book most notably because of the split just the overall size of it the last thing probably to highlight and this is a little different than some of the commentary just heard is when you compare to CLO\u2019s to the last time around on the last great financial crisis back of then about 50% of the syndicated loans going into it were owned by CLOs, and about the other half, were owned by other parties, and a lot of it was heavily owned on swap this time around about three quarters of syndicated loans are held by CLO\u2019s so you have last will recall for selling I think the downward pressure on prices even if. Downgrades continue the bottom probably won't be as deep as it was that time around. On ARCC, the admin credit on the Part 1 fee, I think, is what you're referring to. And I apologize remind me of what you were trying to find out there \nMichael McFerran: I can take it, Mike. I think it was just about the structure of the ARCC Part 1 fee and the deferral mechanism I think it's important to be separate the two because they're two separate calculations around earning and deferring I think it's important that we differentiate between the fee getting earned and the fee getting paid. So the way that the part 1 fee works is it's calculated quarterly against the 7% hurdle pre incentive fee and then we compare that to the extent that it's above the 7% hurdle for the quarter we get a 20% part 1 incentive fee said by way of reference this quarter was about 9% against the 7%. There is also a kind of a nuanced deferral mechanism which frankly we inherited when the DDC went public in 2004 that is designed I think to be theoretically protect liquidity in that portfolio to the extent that you are seeing credit deterioration and income deterioration. And basically what it does is to the extent that it is earned, it then looks at your return of payments to shareholders and NAV as to whether or not to pay it. And so there could be situations and we saw this in 2009 where even though the book is performing and paying cash interest and therefore able to support the payment of the incentive fee and the payment of the dividend, it traps the fee. But the fee is earned and then gets paid out at a later date. What\u2019s unique about the calculation is it\u2019s a four quarter look back and then it resets on the new NAV. So basically what happens is if you were to trap that fee, it would likely pay out starting a year later when you were in that new, that new NAV hurdle. So if you look at our history, the Part 1 incentive fee has been earned every quarter since ARCC went public. And then the deferral mechanism obviously is just a function of unrealized losses, which either come back or resets your NAV and then it pays. So I don\u2019t know if that was too complicated or not, Craig, but it\u2019s a little bit of a nuanced.\nOperator: And our next\u2026\nMichael McFerran: Just to reiterate, Craig, I think you saw ARCC announced earnings yesterday and obviously we are not in a deferral situation. Sorry operator.\nOperator: No, not a problem. And our next question will come from Gerry O'Hara with Jeffries. Please go ahead.\nGerry O'Hara: Okay. Thanks for taking my question this morning. Actually similar questions to follow-up, I think to Ken\u2019s question earlier with respect to incentive generation required for eligibility, I think his question is credit, I am not sure if the private equity side was touched on, but perhaps if you could comment on that, that would are helpful?\nMichael McFerran: Sure. The funds that I think fell out of incentive generating this quarter were there is only three what I would call our flagship funds across all of our businesses, two in private equity, one in real estate and all three of those funds are funds still in their investment period. They fell below the pref returns, but again, where they were in their lifecycle. There were funds, I would call, in carry harvesting mode. If you look at where our crude carry was at year end than it is today, it\u2019s mostly concentrated with funds are still generating and past their investment period with most of those being in both private equity and real estate.\nMichael Arougheti: Hey, Gerry. I think I want to reiterate what Mike talked about in the prepared remarks just for a second, which is obviously incentive-related earnings are an important part of our business model, but it\u2019s not the predominant part of our business model. And as we have talked about on prior calls, we switch to capital management plan, where we were pegging our dividend to our FRE and using our performance-related earnings to effectively retain earnings compounded for lower tax rate and invest back into the core earnings engine. And so I think it\u2019s important to contextualize those types of moves against the framework of how we manage the P&L in the balance sheet. And so were you to look at the net accrued carry while we are not immune to the downdraft, we basically saw it go from $340 million to $235 million. But what that\u2019s not accounting for is the wave of new funds that sit behind it that will obviously replenish and continue to grow that. So I think it\u2019s worth paying attention to it. But I just want to remind everybody that it\u2019s not actually a significant driver of the profit picture at Ares or it doesn\u2019t factor into the support of the dividend.\nGerry O'Hara: Okay, that\u2019s a helpful reminder. And this is perhaps a broader question, but Ares managed business very well through the financial crisis, are there any one or two I guess if you will from that time period or perhaps actually better stated and changes that were made to the investment process that have really shone through or shown to be advantageous as we have kind of moved into and wherever we are at the stage of this current crisis?\nMichael Arougheti: I will say couple of things and we talked about it in the prepared remarks but each crisis is different but the crisis response tends to be similar. If not familiar and I think the good news is the senior management team has been together along time and navigated all the crisis. And so there is a lot of institutional muscle memory and a lot of learning. I think what\u2019s unique about this one is, it is very heavily, it\u2019s a liquidity driven crisis and so I think now more than ever we are focused on liquidity whether that\u2019s liquidity at Ares liquidity with in our funds and liquidity when the portfolio companies and I think people who mismanage their liquidity position going into to this or feeling the pain and those that are not taking the liquidity short falls seriously enough and allowing for an extended period of dislocation, I think we are also going to suffer. So maybe differently here we are being a little bit more judicious in terms of how we are thinking about liquidity and how we are investing and then I think the big lesson learned is you can never time the bottom so you have to be investing through the crisis. And that\u2019s why these phases even though there are uncertain in terms of how long they are going to be, and whether or not we get to test the lows that we saw in March in the future is unclear but you have to be investing all along the way to make sure that you are capturing the opportunity. So I think what you will see from us which is what you are seeing from us before is we are going to measured in our deployment at each of these phases and obviously how we access the market is going to be change depending on the phase that we are in. but we are also a much larger, much broader, much more diversified company than we were 12 years ago. And I think that, that serves us well we just have more data points more information, more count of people, more access to capital. And so we did very well in 08, and 09 and subsequent years but when you look at where we're positioned now, and where our funds are positioned relative to where we were then we are obviously just in much better place.\nGerry O'Hara: Great. Thanks for taking my questions this afternoon.\nMichael Arougheti: Thanks.\nOperator: Now our next question will come from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. \nChris Harris: Yes, thanks. So piling on to that last question there. One other things it seems a bit different in this recession is the severe impacts on the small and mid-size businesses. First maybe to larger ones that have perhaps more access to capital. Ares\u2019s core being the middle market that\u2019s creating really good investment opportunities for you but at the same time could present some elevated risks. So how should we be thinking about the risk of being middle market investor and lender in this environment? \nMichael Arougheti: Yes. I will give you my two cents and then Kipp or others -- if you want to pile on feel free but we have been trying over the last couple of years to help people understand the value of being senior secured lender at the top of the balance sheet in a controlled position versus the risks have being an equity owner below. So we would agree one of the challenges today is a lot of the money that has found it\u2019s way at least into the healing of the market is going to companies that frankly don\u2019t need it and the small business and consumer probably still liquidity challenge and feeling that the strain. But if you look at our middle market lending books they are predominantly senior secured. They are predominantly in situations where we are the control lender. They are predominantly in situations where there is a large well capitalized institutional equity owner below us and maybe echoing what I just talked about in terms of how we are positioned. The size and quality of the companies that we lending to and our private credit books as just much different than it was 12-years ago. In terms of the institutional quality and franchise nature of those businesses. So as Kipp and the team talked about on ARCC\u2019s call and you can see it in the credit metrics. There is obviously a modest pick up but we had almost 100%. I think there is 100% payment we are close to it in the quarter slight tick up in the non-accruals and I think that\u2019s a function of the quality of the underlying book but also the fact that there we are facing off against institutional equity owners which is in and of itself a risk mitigant So as long as you're going into it liquid and as long as you have the capability to actually own a company to the extent that you need to foreclose on it through the senior loan I actually think there's money to be made and when all of a sudden done this will wind up having been an equity issue more than it is a credit issue at least for a well underwritten book like I think we have. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \nAlex Blostein: Great hi, thanks for taking the question thanks for all the color as well I wanted to ask you guys around some of the strategic M&A priorities I think Mike both Mike\u2019s actually I think highlighted that in your prepared remarks with respect to flexibility on the balance sheet and obviously there is historically more causative nature of some of the growth initiatives you guys put into place so anything in particular comes to mind either in some of the more dislocated areas for kind of corporate M&A or accelerating some of the initiatives that you've been trying to build whether it's real estate or other things some color there would be helpful thanks.\nMichael Arougheti: Sure so we've been pretty explicit on prior calls as to where we are focusing and obviously there were insurance. Asia and real assets and obviously you're seeing us execute well against that strategic framework with SSG the SNBC. tie up and the continued development of these Aspida platform so obviously we will continue to use our balance sheet to advance those initiatives real estate infrastructure and real assets broadly defined continues to be a big focus for us it is becoming a bigger focus as telling you something that you probably know real estate is there's just a significant amount of distress and transformational change happening in the real estate markets as a result of the health and economic crisis and so we would expect through M&A a new product development to be able to actually accelerate the growth of our real estate business organically and in organically coming out of this crisis and so it's always been a priority but I actually think it's probably moved up the list a little bit just given the size of the opportunity set the other thing I would highlight we've talked about this a lot of what we use the balance sheet for is not just strategic M&A but strategic product development and joint ventures and so in a market like this using the balance sheet to acquire assets and teams and then reposition those assets and teams into new business lines is something that we have a lot of experience doing. And we are already having some pretty interesting conversations on some new product development where we can modestly use the balance sheet to launch a new product that sits adjacent to something that we already doing so I would expect that we'll be doing a fair amount of that over the next couple quarters as well. \nAlex Blostein: Great. Thank you much.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Kenneth Lee with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nKenneth Lee: Hi thanks for taking my question I'm just wondering if you could help us frame the relative strength of the liquidity position of the firm talk about any liquidity needs or perhaps any kind of unfunded commitments in the near term thanks.\nMichael Arougheti: Michael you want to take that one \nMichael McFerran: Yes happy to I think we talked about in our prepared remarks. Clearly the balance sheets flush with cash that combined with undrawn access on a revolver 1.4 billion plus of liquidity so feel great about our liquidity position we have no mark to market leverage which I highlighted which is important because there's no exposed flank where we have to worry about funding margin calls or similar types of repayments under. We have no near term debt maturities you probably would have seen we amended each year we usually roll our revolver so our corporate credit facility is now through 2025 so I think from our end from a full balance sheet standpoint where years out from our next bond maturity and have a lot of capital so I think we feel really, really good about that. As far as commitments, we do have GP commitments to our funds, a fairly decent amount of those are held by our employees that invests side-by-side with Ares Management in our funds. We fairly have the settlement of closing of SSG which we have previously disclosed primarily stock and [indiscernible] closed of that transaction with [indiscernible] previously described the amounts. Outside of that, there is other real what I would call contractual liquidity requirements. It\u2019s going to be really more about we have access to a lot of capital for opportunities.\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. And just to frame that, Ken, I actually think if you looked it to Mike\u2019s point, the balance sheet light model has actually got lighter over time as the employees are taking up more and more of the GP commitments, but if you aggregated future funding potential in our existing investment book, I think it\u2019s about $400 million, which obviously doesn\u2019t get deployed quickly.\nKenneth Lee: Many years across our funds?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. So if you would try to think about the demands on the balance sheet from the actual book of GP investments, it\u2019s actually quite small.\nKenneth Lee: Great. Very helpful. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you very much and hope everyone stays safe.\nMichael Arougheti: Thank you.\nOperator: And our final question will come from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nMichael Cyprys: Hi, thanks for squeezing me in here. Just a question on the direct lending opportunity set, just hoping you could elaborate a little bit more there in direct lending, which has been largely sponsored finance I think for you guys like 80:20, just how your direct lending funds are adapting against an evolving opportunity set, that\u2019s not seeing as much LBO activity, how much of the deployment would you say is focused on existing portfolio companies versus making newer investments and maybe you could talk about how you are sourcing some of those newer investments?\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. So, you are right, new buyout activity is somewhat muted although it is happening. So we are closing new transactions in both Europe and the U.S., particularly in industries that are obviously not affected by COVID. So, there is a segment of the economy that can\u2019t be underwritten around technology and certain segments of the healthcare landscape etcetera. So there is stuff to do there, but it is slower. There is an opportunity as we mentioned, I think we will accelerate to provide capital into our existing books. I thought it was interesting on the ARCC call yesterday, Mitch talked about capital deployment into the existing portfolio it was about 14.7% return against an 8% return on loans that came out of the book. That was a pretty good indicator at the title return opportunity that we are seeing bringing capital into that portfolio and about 50% of the deployment in the quarter I think went to existing borrowers. So, where the direct lending teams are spending most of their time is we are underwriting the existing book using their capital to invest to support those companies, but where they are making investments tightening up documents, de-leveraging through equity infusion below us, increasing spreads, fees and all that. So there is a re-underwriting, but then there is also kind a re-rating of the book which we should see come through in higher returns on the embedded loans. Second thing we are doing is in partnership with the Alternative Credit Group and the opportunities funds is leveraging the combined platform on the rescue lending side and that\u2019s been very, very fruitful. There is opportunity for us to provide liquidity into certain companies that have incremental baskets that allow them to actually bring new capital into companies without reopening docks that\u2019s been pretty fruitful for us. So, it's actually been quite active and then needless to say all of our direct lending funds have the ability to actively invest in the secondary market as well. And as you would expect, there is a very long list of names that we are tracking actively as potential secondary opportunities. We would expect that as this volatility extends that as we have done in the past we will start seeing portfolios and single assets are actually coming \u2013 coming back to us as a secondary opportunity as well.\nKipp Deveer: Mike, I will just jump in. It\u2019s Kipp Deveer. I will just say \u2013 I think as this extends as the key point we are going to emerge much stronger. I mean, we definitely see competition in that space significantly weakened for the most part. We see a lot of competition that\u2019s having difficulty dealing with outstanding commitments, providing liquidity to existing portfolio of companies and when the concept of the new deal comes forward, it\u2019s kind of a non-starter. We are in exactly the opposite position and then we have deployed in the U.S. and Europe north of $2 billion since March 1 in a lot of the opportunity sets that Mike outlined. So we are very much in business for new deals although there are fewer of them. I mean, there are lot of other things to do in the current environment that are pretty exciting.\nMichael Cyprys: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our conference call for today.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Arougheti",
            "content": "Thank you, Carl and good afternoon everyone. We wish everyone well during these unprecedented and difficult times and our thoughts are with those who have been affected by this crisis. We want to thank the first responders, healthcare professionals and those on the frontlines risking their lives for our communities across the globe. I also want to thank all of our employees here at Ares who are working harder than ever to drive our company forward through this challenge. It\u2019s really been remarkable to see the seamless transition our entire firm has made to working remotely and we are functioning at full capacity. I could not be more proud of the team. It\u2019s also nice to see so many of our portfolio companies directly supporting our communities whether it\u2019s DuPage Medical, which is running the clinical operations for COVID Triage Center in Chicago\u2019s McCormick Convention Center and delivering high-quality and safe care for non-COVID patients throughout the shelter-in-place period or convergent technologies, as an example, delivering solutions to enhance health security through thermal cameras, contactless access controls and identity management and tracking software. With respect to Ares, I am going to spend a few minutes on why we believe that we are uniquely positioned to navigate this period both offensively and defensively. Our team at Ares is broad, deep and has worked together for a long time, including through past economic cycles. And as we have demonstrated consistently during our tenure, we are very experienced at navigating different and challenging economic environments. As many of you know, we grew faster through the GFC than in any 2 year period since then with AUM and management fees increasing at compounded annual growth rates of 39% and 28% respectively from 2007 to 2009. So, what we are all witnessing now is unique in many respects? Our framework for navigating and responding to crisis is well established and it centers first and foremost around our culture of collaboration. Information, ideas and market insights flow across our platform through both recurring committee meetings, town halls, working groups and nimble point-to-point and cross-team interactions. This has enabled us to navigate the early days of this crisis extraordinarily well. We have also had 8 weeks of cross portfolio company calls to ensure that we are sharing best practices on employee and public health issues, technology, government and regulatory matters, supply chain management, ESG, etcetera. This all exemplifies what you often hear us refer to as the power of our platform, which supports exploring ideas and solving problems and pursuing opportunities across our businesses, geographies and our controlled portfolio of companies. Now more than ever, we are relying on our collaborative culture to deliver optimal outcomes for all of our stakeholders. Our first quarter marked several financial milestones that Mike will cover in further detail. Our results also reflect our resilient and cycle tested model. The first quarter was our 12th consecutive quarter of sequential fee-related earnings growth, with FRE of $93.1 million, an increase of 31% from the same period last year. In addition to reporting record FRE, the first quarter was also a new record for management fees, a new record FRE margin since going public, record fee paying AUM which crossed $100 billion for the first time in our history and our second highest realized income. In addition, fundraising is off to a very strong start with over $6.6 billion raised during the quarter. I do want to highlight certain key characteristics of our business that not only supported strong first quarter results, but also positioned us well going forward. First, we have a management fee centric business model, with most of our revenue coming from management fees that are primarily generated from permanent capital vehicles and long-dated closed end fund structures. We experienced limited capital outflows and our management fees are generally well insulated for mark-to-market fluctuations as we saw this past quarter. This provides us great visibility to growing fee-related earnings and dividends. Second, in addition to managing long-dated and permanent capital, we have always had a bias towards structuring funds and other mandates could be as flexible as possible. This allows us to invest between liquid and illiquid strategies across capital structures and to pivot between regular way investing and special opportunities or distressed investing during periods of volatility. Third, we tend to run our funds with a significant amount of dry powder and generally begin raising successor funds when predecessor funds are about 60% to 70% deployed. We went into the crisis with significant available capital to invest and we ended the first quarter with approximately $33 billion of dry powder. Next, similar type of fund level, we also believe in maintaining significant excess liquidity at the management company and we run a balance sheet light model. For many reasons, we have never aspired to have a large balance sheet that takes outsized positions and investments. Instead, we have pursued a balance sheet strategy that focuses on activities intended to grow our core earnings. Our balance sheet is strong with available liquidity of over $1.4 billion, no near-term debt maturities, no net leverage and no leverage with mark-to-market or similar attributes that would ever require us having to meet margin calls or other fundings. Our liquidity position us well to capitalize on potential strategic growth opportunities that this market should present to us. And last, our net realized performance fees are primarily driven by realizations from our closed end funds. Our long-term locked up capital means that we are not forced sellers of assets and while valuations can move up or down, they reflect unrealized estimated fair value at any point in time and are not necessarily reflective of where we would or expect to monetize investments in our funds in the future. On a related note, our capital base is meaningfully over-weighted to more resilient credit-based strategies that invest at the top of the capital structure and by definition take the last loss on investment. Not only this credit provide more stability in values, but it is also easier and quicker to deploy in volatile markets when equity risk is more difficult to price. Now, turning to the markets, we expect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to impact the economy in three general phases and I will discuss how Ares has responded or plans to respond in each phase. In the first phase, beginning in early March and continuing through the end of the first quarter, we witnessed severe disruption in market prices. It began with the equity markets, led into the high yield and leveraged loan markets and then across the spectrum of almost all risk assets, including the private markets. The healthcare crisis and government shutdowns triggered almost immediate impacts to the liquidity of businesses and the disruption impacting nearly every company to varying degrees. Fortunately, as a percent of our firm-wide AUM, we have relatively small exposure to the \u201cground-zero\u201d industries, most heavily impacted assets, such as oil and gas, travel and leisure and retail, but we are certainly not immune. In this first phase, we focused on doing everything we could to understand the liquidity needs of our portfolio companies and to protect value in the existing book. On the investing front, we began actively using our dry powder to invest in and trade to stressed assets, while retaining significant dry powder to what we believe it would be a long drawn-out recessionary environment. In the second phase where we believe we are now, significant fiscal and monetary stimulus has been announced and it is timing it\u2019s away into the markets and the economy, albeit in some cases unevenly and slowly. Following this massive fiscal and monetary response, there has been a meaningful rally in the public equity and credit markets, which began in late March. But we would argue that the recent performance in many markets is at odds with the current fundamental economic reality. Liquidity has not yet reached certain segments effectively and a significant need for rescue capital and liquidity remains across the private markets. This period of stagnation could be with us for this foreseeable future and it could result in an extended period of continued market volatility due to the depth of demand shock on our consumer-driven economy. This market environment plays into our strong relationships across the private markets of North America, Europe and soon to be Asia. In general, we are focused on providing rescue capital primarily to high-quality second order impact companies or those companies not in the most affected industries. We continue to find some attractive opportunities in the liquid markets as well. And in the third phase, once the significant percentage of the working population is fully back to work, we expect to return to \u201cnew normal\u201d market environment. We would then envision a prolonged period with less competition where we will be able to invest in great companies and assets at attractive values. Importantly, we believe that our flexible strategy with the ability to invest in the liquid and illiquid assets using our deep research and private markets expertise works well in all stages. Our investment strategy flexes to a particular market environment, which is why we strive in so many diverse environments of our company\u2019s history. Many of you have access about fund raising in this environment. The good new is that we have continued our fundraising momentum even after the outbreak of the pandemic. For example, 5 of our commingled funds together closed on more than $2 billion of capital in the month of March. And then during April and into early May, we have received additional inflows of approximately $2 billion across strategies and our credit, private equity and real estate groups. We continue to expect the strong fundraising year in 2020. Our past success has been driven in part by expanding relationships to our existing clients through re-ups into larger existing strategies and new capital into other Ares strategies. Historically, existing investors have accounted for 70% to 80% of our fundraising each year since our IPO. The first quarter was no exception as our direct fundraising from existing investors accounted for 74% of our total quarterly fundraising. This puts us in an adventitious competitive position in the current virtual environment as LPs in general are more focused on re-ups to existing funds or new commitments to existing managers rolling out these funds. We are fortunate to be in a position with a large number of successor funds, coupled with some actionable new funds that can invest well in this market environment. Some of our best performing fund vintages were raised and deployed during the last global financial crisis and I think investors recognize the attractive investment opportunities that can arise during periods of significant volatility. As discussed in our call in February, we have at least 8 large successor funds and new commingled funds either in the market, pre-launch or to be launched within the next 6 to 12 months. This includes our special opportunities fund, or 6 corporate private equity fund, 2 real estate private equity funds, our alternative credit flagship funds, our 5th European direct leading fund, our second junior capital private credit fund, and our second U.S. senior direct lending funds. Altogether, these represent at least $25 billion of incremental targeted capital, all in strategies and formats that can actively take advantage of the current and future distressed markets. Our fundraising efforts will also continue with our strategic managed accounts and strategic partnerships, our public funds, smaller commingled funds and other closed end vehicles. We are making significant fundraising progress on our funds that are in the market, many of which are also seeing expanded investment opportunity set as a result of the current market dislocation. Our special opportunities fund, which focuses on illiquid and liquid distressed investing, including rescue capital investments, has resonated even more with investors in the current market. With that in mind, we have closed on approximately $3 billion for this fund, which well exceeds the fund\u2019s target of $2 billion. The special opportunities team has been actively deploying capital with $1 billion invested since the inception split about half in privately negotiating and half in secondary distressed investments, most of which was invested in the last 60 days. We are also nearing a meaningful first close to our 6 flexible capital private equity funds. As a reminder, our flexible capital private equity strategy pivots primarily between the stressed investment and prudently leveraged by our investing. Not surprisingly in the current environment, the team is focused almost exclusively on distressed investing and we believe that there is a significant opportunity for this fund to invest in high-quality companies that had issues with their balance sheets and/or our need of liquidity from the financial sponsor such as Ares that can help them chart a path back to growth. In the midst of the dislocation, we also held additional closings for our U.S. opportunistic real estate PE fund, bringing the total raise to-date of $1.1 billion against the target of $1.5 billion. This strategy also has a focus on buying stressed high-quality real estate assets. We also held the first closing of more than \u20ac500 million through our European value add real estate PE fund and our real estate debt funds continued fundraising with another $400 million inflows during the first quarter. We have seen strong interest in our flagship alternative credit fund. This fund pursues an opportunistic strategy focused on asset-oriented investments. Given the current market disruption, this strategy\u2019s opportunity set was meaningfully expanded and the size of the investment pipeline materially increased post COVID-19. This fund also includes an innovative feature that allocates at least 10% of the fund\u2019s performance fee to global health and global education charities. This fund was launched last year prior to the global health crisis and has always contained this profit sharing in charitable mission. The fund closed on $786 million in March and total capital raised to-date stands at approximately $1.3 billion. We expect to hit or exceed our target of $2 billion in the near future. Also, we just launched our 5th European direct leading fund this week. Based on our leadership position and the opportunities set in European direct lending, we currently expect that this fund could be the largest private commingled fund in our company\u2019s history. The other credit funds that I mentioned are expected to be launched later in the year or early in 2021. So, as you can see, we expect a significant fundraising year despite the challenges that some investors face. During the full first quarter, our drawdown funds invested more than $4 billion, mostly across our credit platform and direct lending and alternative credit as we focused off the balance sheet in high-quality credits and assets. With the extreme volatility in the first quarter, we were also very active trading in the liquid markets, where the stress and dislocation were most prevalent. Post the COVID outbreak we treaded approximately $5 billion in liquids securities in March, an increase of more than 50% year-over-year bringing total trading volumes to over $11 billion in the quarter. This represents a 30% increase in the first quarter of last year and highlights our ability to take advantage of these market dislocations. Some of the best investment opportunities right now have pivoted into the private markets where our sourcing advantages can play an even greater roll. It is now important once again to use our relationships to gain access to the highest quality opportunities for companies needing rescue capital or critical financing for acquisitions in market segments less impacted by the disruption. We expect deployment to pickup pace throughout the year with a focus across our credit, distressed, rescue capital, alternative credit and opportunistic real estate businesses. Investments spreads and structures have markedly improved across the credit landscape as many competitors and banks are not open for business, which we believe will position us to boost future returns. And from a performance standpoint, our Q1 fund performance across our credit, PE and real estate strategies naturally reflects the significant disruption that occurred in March. On a positive note, our funds generally exceeded their relevant public market indices. Our private equity composite was down 9.3%. Our European and U.S. real estate private equity strategies declined between 3.5% and 4.2% respectively and our credit strategies declined anywhere from 11.8% and 12.2% on the liquids side to between 0.4% and 7.7% on the direct lending side in our significant funds. Importantly, our investors are patient and they measure our fund performance over much longer time periods and on a realized basis. Of course, the market volatility that impacted our fund values also may provide opportunities for us to make long-term investments at more interesting entry points. And maybe lastly before I hand the call over to Mike, I want to provide some updates on certain of our recently announced strategic activities. As many of you saw, we formalized a strategic partnership with Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp in late March. We had a longstanding mutually rewarding relationship with SMBC and we had been discussing the potential for strategic partnership for over a year. Through this partnership, we expect to gain strategic distribution in the Japanese market with their broad client base and we can also partner with their significant balance sheet to help us grow existing and to launch new businesses. We expect a meaningful earnings contribution from the partnership synergies over time. We also aligned interest around the partnership through a sale of 4.9% of our common equity to SMBC, which we believe will be accretive over the long-term. While the timing coincided with the early days of the crisis, it\u2019s our view that this capital is even more valuable than it would have been before. This equity capital puts us in a position to play offense in this opportunistic investment environment, where we can hopefully scale our business in areas that are highly strategic for us. Second, our SSG Capital transaction is proceeding smoothly and we now expect the closing in late June or early July with approximately $6 billion in AUM. We are very excited to bring onboard a leading secured and special opportunities investor in the pan-Asian region at a time where we expect it to be very opportunistic to invest. Similar to us, they continue to have uninterrupted fundraising. Third, I wanted to provide an update on our insurance solutions initiative, which as you know, we call Aspida Financial. We expect to close the platform acquisition of Pavonia Life in the second quarter or early third quarter and there are many interesting acquisition opportunities in the insurance sector and we have been building a pipeline of reinsurance transactions as well. After closing, we will soon be prepared to rollout our life insurance and annuity products in an environment that will be more advantageous than before as retirees continue to struggle to find quality investment alternatives and insurance products in the current volatile and low interest rate environment. And now with that, I am going to turn the call over to Mike McFerran for his remarks on our business positioning and more detail on our financial results. Mike? Thanks Mike. So in conclusion, we believe that our business model not only resilient, but also well positioned to thrive in what we expect will be a continued volatile market environment. Our management fee centric model rooted in credit and flexible strategies coupled with our balance sheet light model and strong balance sheet puts us in a strong position to navigate these times. It is during these volatile periods that we believe our organization and the power of our platform rise to the occasion and shine through. We don\u2019t view this as being an economic cycle, where we will simply snapback to yesterday anytime soon, rather we project a long U shaped recovery and with that an unusual and interesting period ahead with its share of challenges, but also ensured unique investment opportunities. It\u2019s in times like these that having investment sourcing, underwriting and portfolio management capabilities are critical and having brought access to capital is key. And to survive, but not just survive, but to succeed you need to be well positioned with both and we believe that we are. I echo Mike's comments and wishing everyone safety and health. I look forward to updating you on our progress on next quarter's call and I'd also like to end by thanking the entire team one last time for all their hard work and dedication these last couple of weeks as always we appreciate your time and support for the company and your time today. And with that operator, we would like to open up a lot of questions. Good. How are you Rob? Yes. As of now everything is closing kind of as originally scheduled at target size and as you heard in the prepared remarks we've actually been pleased in certain situations like our special opportunities fund and our alternative credit fund where we have actually seen accelerated fund raising just given that those strategies are particularly well suited for the current environment and so as we sit here today we are not actually seeing any change in terms of the pacing obviously that could change as we get deeper into this as investors are doing with things like denominator fact and challenges of working remotely but as of now we're not we're not forecasting that. Yes I mean as we said we had 8 funds that are in the market are soon to come to market totaling over $25 billion that all can invest well into distress. And so I think our investors have a pretty nice selection of strategies to choose from to try to take advantage of the current dislocation I think the reupps and we talked about this on prior calls pre crisis there was an over arching trend of larger managers taking more wallet share I think that's accelerating now. Obviously, it's easier for an LP to underwrite an existing manager. There are also some nuances where certain investors actually need face to face meetings by our regs and so I think if you are an existing manager with a good track record and a deep relationship with just a lot easier particularly remotely to focus on a reupp so we are actually seeing some of that getting reflecting in larger commitments on reup which I think is just a reflection of people maybe allocating more to some of the larger existing managers than the new funds. Thanks Rob. Sure. Thanks for the question. Ken. So, just to clarify the comment, it wasn\u2019t really geared just towards competition from banks, I think there is more broader comment just about what the competitors set will look like on the back end of this and what we have seen in every cycle that we have managed through as a consolidation of market share and market position coming through financial crisis. So, we would expect to see reduced competition and reduced liquidity in the hands of competitors across the entire competitive set. That would be consistent with our past experience and consistent with what we are seeing in the market now. With regard to the banks, obviously, we don\u2019t compete directly with them, but for in certain segments of our direct lending business, particularly the higher end of size range of potential borrowers needless to say in this environment while we are still active, the banks are not active underwriting and syndicating leveraged finance product. I think as importantly you saw this world through some corners of the market before the stimulus was put forward and it\u2019s actually still happening in certain segments of the market, where there are margin facilities or repo lines or swap facilities that banks have been moving to get liquid as I think most investors are. And we have seen a reduced appetite to commit new capital across the board from the banks. So, I would characterize the bank behavior more as what we are seeing in terms of lending liquidity providers into the market versus lending head-to-head competitors with us. And so for the last 20 years I think people have been asking us about bank competition returning in the potential impact on our business. We historically have not really competed head-to-head and I don\u2019t expect that to change. With regard to the government programs, oops sorry go ahead. Sure. I think the question was around government programs and whether that would catalyze increased competition from the banks and I think just similar comment is no. I think the banks are obviously very busy managing their existing exposures the same way that we and others are and then obviously busy from policy mandate executing on the government loan program. But we don\u2019t expect their purchase patient in those programs to somehow change their competitive position relative to us. So, on the asset side, declining credit or fell out of incentive generating, most of that were consisted of pretty much separate accounts or more strategic separate accounts that are for lack of a better term earlier in their lifecycles, these are all accounts that start deploying capital. So, while they fell below the pref returns, they not far underneath them and again they are also deploying capital and they are all European style waterfront. We don\u2019t think it changes the overall outlook for those. We think its bit of a function especially again when you think about IRR math earlier days of funds. It\u2019s little more volatile to cash activity valuations. I would say, Ken, as a general rule and it depends on the strategy, it\u2019s probably somewhere between 2.5% and 4% on the high end in terms of math build. So to Mike\u2019s point of view, you wanted to put a number behind it. It\u2019s very, very low single digit. Sure. You have to \u2013 we kind of look at AUM across the entire platform as we talked about, firm-wide AUM is kind of the best way that we can think about exposures and are waiting. In terms of retail exposures broadly, about 1.5% \u2013 1.7% of the firm\u2019s AUM is invested in some part of the retail landscape, travel and leisure, broadly speaking, which includes things like gaming and may include some aerospace that\u2019s probably an inflated representation, because they are not all directly impacted, it\u2019s about 3.5% of our AUM and energy is in and around 3%, but of that, only about 1% is actually in oil and gas exploration with the remainder being in renewable energy and midstream infrastructure. So will I leave it to you to decide how you want to differentiate between kind of the upstream and midstream? But if you were to look at those exposures, relative to public indices, they are meaningfully underweight. And when you look at those exposures relative to any specific funds, they are underweight as well. So, as an example, in our real estate business, we have no hotel exposure in any of our significant real estate funds. In fact, we have actually sold a big portfolio of hotel investments over the last 18 months. So, I think it\u2019s hard to be completely un-invested in these parts of the market, but we are underweight and where we are invested, it\u2019s pretty well distributed across the platform. So, it\u2019s not going to impact any single fund. Sure. And we have got a bunch of our senior PMs on the line. So I may ask them to provide a little bit of color, but going back to the framework of the different phases we are obviously quite busy in the first phase in the liquid markets before the stimulus came and provided a backdrop of support. So, when you look at our deployment through March, it was largely buying assets in the secondary markets as we are now transitioning into Phase 2. We pivoted into the private markets. And as we said in the prepared remarks, the bulk of what we are doing there is providing rescue capital to companies that need a liquidity bridge or want to buy \u201cinsurance\u201d to play offense in this market similar to the way that we have thought about running our own company, but maybe just to give it a little bit of color, I will ask Scott Graves who runs our special ops business and then maybe Joel on AltCredit just to give a little bit of a flavor for how they are playing it. So, I think it will help you better understand where the opportunities are. Yes, Scott. It\u2019s Mike. I think it\u2019s a good point maybe just about the sourcing, because we mentioned in the prepared remarks, but having an embedded portfolio close to 2,000 companies putting aside the number of marketable securities that we track puts us in a unique position to offer these types of solutions either into the existing portfolio or into companies that we have diligence before, but not invested in. So, it does allow us to pivot very quickly into the private markets like few people can. Joel, one \u2013 do want to maybe Joel, quickly on the Alternative Credit side, which I think is probably what we are seeing some of the most acute liquidity shock just a quick overview to some of things that we are focusing on there. Dean, probably maybe more color than you have argued for, but I always think it helps bring the opportunity into life. So, thanks guys. Thank you, Craig. I will start with the first part of that, Craig. Hope you are well. On the CLOs, the sub fees if you think about a CLO waterfall, you have \u2013 really, there is two fee components on the recurring management fees. There is a senior fee, which literally sits at top and is actually senior to the AAA bonds. And then you have a subordinate fee which depending on the deal is somewhere closer to the bottom. Our deals are structured similar but a little different and a little more conservative than others in the market in so much as our blend of fees is approximately 50-50 between senior fees and the sub fees in CLO\u2019s so a higher percentage of our CLO management fees comes from the senior fees than you usually expect used to seeing. And second, our sub fees, for I'd say, almost three quarters of our deals are usually senior to at least one of the OC tests or an interest diversion test. As far as what it means from an FRE perspective, maybe just kind of compartmentalize is the size of it to us. CLO sub fees again represent about half our fees from CLO\u2019s and that amount was I think about 3 just maybe just over 3% this quarter call it 3.3%. So just over $9 million so when we think about the diversion risk as we ended the quarter all of our CLO\u2019s were passing all their OC tests again we don\u2019t want to comment another managers I think CLO\u2019s are different as far as structure to some extent and how they manage are different some CLO\u2019s are managed ROE 2 rating and picking the highest return points with invading spectrums whereas we similar to everything else we do at Ares have a very fundamental credit focused approach to the portfolio of CLO\u2019s I think that enables them to be more conservatively positioned But if I were to think about kind of a draconian scenario whereas some CLO\u2019s were to start failing our OC tests based on what we saw on the financial crisis and how we stressed it I think to see may be kind of a more of a dire scenario say up to half the deals failing for one to two quarters which for us you would think about as being one I think that\u2019s probably worst than we saw during the great financial crisis of 08, 09 but for us to be an impact on management fees that\u2019s for all practical purposes to minimize so I feel pretty good again about the CLO book most notably because of the split just the overall size of it the last thing probably to highlight and this is a little different than some of the commentary just heard is when you compare to CLO\u2019s to the last time around on the last great financial crisis back of then about 50% of the syndicated loans going into it were owned by CLOs, and about the other half, were owned by other parties, and a lot of it was heavily owned on swap this time around about three quarters of syndicated loans are held by CLO\u2019s so you have last will recall for selling I think the downward pressure on prices even if. Downgrades continue the bottom probably won't be as deep as it was that time around. On ARCC, the admin credit on the Part 1 fee, I think, is what you're referring to. And I apologize remind me of what you were trying to find out there Hey, Gerry. I think I want to reiterate what Mike talked about in the prepared remarks just for a second, which is obviously incentive-related earnings are an important part of our business model, but it\u2019s not the predominant part of our business model. And as we have talked about on prior calls, we switch to capital management plan, where we were pegging our dividend to our FRE and using our performance-related earnings to effectively retain earnings compounded for lower tax rate and invest back into the core earnings engine. And so I think it\u2019s important to contextualize those types of moves against the framework of how we manage the P&L in the balance sheet. And so were you to look at the net accrued carry while we are not immune to the downdraft, we basically saw it go from $340 million to $235 million. But what that\u2019s not accounting for is the wave of new funds that sit behind it that will obviously replenish and continue to grow that. So I think it\u2019s worth paying attention to it. But I just want to remind everybody that it\u2019s not actually a significant driver of the profit picture at Ares or it doesn\u2019t factor into the support of the dividend.\nGerry O'Hara: Okay, that\u2019s a helpful reminder. And this is perhaps a broader question, but Ares managed business very well through the financial crisis, are there any one or two I guess if you will from that time period or perhaps actually better stated and changes that were made to the investment process that have really shone through or shown to be advantageous as we have kind of moved into and wherever we are at the stage of this current crisis? I will say couple of things and we talked about it in the prepared remarks but each crisis is different but the crisis response tends to be similar. If not familiar and I think the good news is the senior management team has been together along time and navigated all the crisis. And so there is a lot of institutional muscle memory and a lot of learning. I think what\u2019s unique about this one is, it is very heavily, it\u2019s a liquidity driven crisis and so I think now more than ever we are focused on liquidity whether that\u2019s liquidity at Ares liquidity with in our funds and liquidity when the portfolio companies and I think people who mismanage their liquidity position going into to this or feeling the pain and those that are not taking the liquidity short falls seriously enough and allowing for an extended period of dislocation, I think we are also going to suffer. So maybe differently here we are being a little bit more judicious in terms of how we are thinking about liquidity and how we are investing and then I think the big lesson learned is you can never time the bottom so you have to be investing through the crisis. And that\u2019s why these phases even though there are uncertain in terms of how long they are going to be, and whether or not we get to test the lows that we saw in March in the future is unclear but you have to be investing all along the way to make sure that you are capturing the opportunity. So I think what you will see from us which is what you are seeing from us before is we are going to measured in our deployment at each of these phases and obviously how we access the market is going to be change depending on the phase that we are in. but we are also a much larger, much broader, much more diversified company than we were 12 years ago. And I think that, that serves us well we just have more data points more information, more count of people, more access to capital. And so we did very well in 08, and 09 and subsequent years but when you look at where we're positioned now, and where our funds are positioned relative to where we were then we are obviously just in much better place.\nGerry O'Hara: Great. Thanks for taking my questions this afternoon. Thanks. Yes. I will give you my two cents and then Kipp or others -- if you want to pile on feel free but we have been trying over the last couple of years to help people understand the value of being senior secured lender at the top of the balance sheet in a controlled position versus the risks have being an equity owner below. So we would agree one of the challenges today is a lot of the money that has found it\u2019s way at least into the healing of the market is going to companies that frankly don\u2019t need it and the small business and consumer probably still liquidity challenge and feeling that the strain. But if you look at our middle market lending books they are predominantly senior secured. They are predominantly in situations where we are the control lender. They are predominantly in situations where there is a large well capitalized institutional equity owner below us and maybe echoing what I just talked about in terms of how we are positioned. The size and quality of the companies that we lending to and our private credit books as just much different than it was 12-years ago. In terms of the institutional quality and franchise nature of those businesses. So as Kipp and the team talked about on ARCC\u2019s call and you can see it in the credit metrics. There is obviously a modest pick up but we had almost 100%. I think there is 100% payment we are close to it in the quarter slight tick up in the non-accruals and I think that\u2019s a function of the quality of the underlying book but also the fact that there we are facing off against institutional equity owners which is in and of itself a risk mitigant So as long as you're going into it liquid and as long as you have the capability to actually own a company to the extent that you need to foreclose on it through the senior loan I actually think there's money to be made and when all of a sudden done this will wind up having been an equity issue more than it is a credit issue at least for a well underwritten book like I think we have. Sure so we've been pretty explicit on prior calls as to where we are focusing and obviously there were insurance. Asia and real assets and obviously you're seeing us execute well against that strategic framework with SSG the SNBC. tie up and the continued development of these Aspida platform so obviously we will continue to use our balance sheet to advance those initiatives real estate infrastructure and real assets broadly defined continues to be a big focus for us it is becoming a bigger focus as telling you something that you probably know real estate is there's just a significant amount of distress and transformational change happening in the real estate markets as a result of the health and economic crisis and so we would expect through M&A a new product development to be able to actually accelerate the growth of our real estate business organically and in organically coming out of this crisis and so it's always been a priority but I actually think it's probably moved up the list a little bit just given the size of the opportunity set the other thing I would highlight we've talked about this a lot of what we use the balance sheet for is not just strategic M&A but strategic product development and joint ventures and so in a market like this using the balance sheet to acquire assets and teams and then reposition those assets and teams into new business lines is something that we have a lot of experience doing. And we are already having some pretty interesting conversations on some new product development where we can modestly use the balance sheet to launch a new product that sits adjacent to something that we already doing so I would expect that we'll be doing a fair amount of that over the next couple quarters as well. Michael you want to take that one Yes. And just to frame that, Ken, I actually think if you looked it to Mike\u2019s point, the balance sheet light model has actually got lighter over time as the employees are taking up more and more of the GP commitments, but if you aggregated future funding potential in our existing investment book, I think it\u2019s about $400 million, which obviously doesn\u2019t get deployed quickly. Yes. So if you would try to think about the demands on the balance sheet from the actual book of GP investments, it\u2019s actually quite small. Thank you. Sure. So, you are right, new buyout activity is somewhat muted although it is happening. So we are closing new transactions in both Europe and the U.S., particularly in industries that are obviously not affected by COVID. So, there is a segment of the economy that can\u2019t be underwritten around technology and certain segments of the healthcare landscape etcetera. So there is stuff to do there, but it is slower. There is an opportunity as we mentioned, I think we will accelerate to provide capital into our existing books. I thought it was interesting on the ARCC call yesterday, Mitch talked about capital deployment into the existing portfolio it was about 14.7% return against an 8% return on loans that came out of the book. That was a pretty good indicator at the title return opportunity that we are seeing bringing capital into that portfolio and about 50% of the deployment in the quarter I think went to existing borrowers. So, where the direct lending teams are spending most of their time is we are underwriting the existing book using their capital to invest to support those companies, but where they are making investments tightening up documents, de-leveraging through equity infusion below us, increasing spreads, fees and all that. So there is a re-underwriting, but then there is also kind a re-rating of the book which we should see come through in higher returns on the embedded loans. Second thing we are doing is in partnership with the Alternative Credit Group and the opportunities funds is leveraging the combined platform on the rescue lending side and that\u2019s been very, very fruitful. There is opportunity for us to provide liquidity into certain companies that have incremental baskets that allow them to actually bring new capital into companies without reopening docks that\u2019s been pretty fruitful for us. So, it's actually been quite active and then needless to say all of our direct lending funds have the ability to actively invest in the secondary market as well. And as you would expect, there is a very long list of names that we are tracking actively as potential secondary opportunities. We would expect that as this volatility extends that as we have done in the past we will start seeing portfolios and single assets are actually coming \u2013 coming back to us as a secondary opportunity as well."

            "name": "Joel Holsinger",
            "content": "Sure. Thanks, Mike. This is Joel Holsinger. Yes, I think there were small windows across alternative credit in the liquid markets. And if you think of what we do in Alternative Credit, a lot of tools, there is loans, receivables and underlying leases and we do lending on the basics as well as rescue as well as asset opportunity and then the liquid markets. And what we are seeing similar to what Scott saw was there was short windows where there was opportunities to buy stuff in the secondary market in the liquid, but where we are seeing the biggest opportunity or the lack of a better term semi-liquid opportunities. Their opportunities were created by the liquidity shock from mark-to-market and repo financing where with the downdraft that 3 or 4 weeks ago, they have created a lot of longer lasting pain across both other credit type funds as well as some of the mortgage rates you have seen in the news. And we have been very active in those opportunities and what you will see is the opportunities we are seeing there are large. So, there is a short lift of people that they can go to be able to solve some of their issues and we just closed on the deal couple of weeks ago, it was $350 million that was effectively taking out a mark-to-market repo financing where they had it advanced at a much higher advance rate in the very low cost to capital, 2% to 3% cost of capital, so something from our standpoint, where we brought them a private solution and where 15% to 20% type IRRs but on a more term permanent type basis. And I think it\u2019s reflective of the opportunity set where you have to have the ability in the power of the platform to be able to do size and bring the solution to the table. So they are still directly sourced and bilateral type transactions, but lot of it is coming out of the pain that\u2019s occurring from the swift downturn of the liquidity of liquid markets."

            "name": "Scott Graves",
            "content": "Sure. Thanks Mike. This is Scott Graves. We look at the world on a relative value basis across Ares and compare what we can achieve in the public market versus the opportunities available in the private market. And to give a little bit of color to what Mike said, you know March traded down faster than any cycle that we have seen or invested in. It traded down faster than \u201808, it traded down faster than \u201801, it traded down faster than the early 90s cycle. It was on pace with the Great Depression of the late 1920s and beginning of the 30s. That shock in the market presented terrific opportunities, significant liquidity, significant opportunity to buy marketable securities what we thought were very attractive prices generally focused on the top of the capital structure through the stimulus plan that came the week of March 23 and right around April 9. We have seen a bounce in the public markets. And certainly with the view toward almost 2,000 portfolio companies at Ares, it feels like the opportunity set in the public markets has been muted and we are shifting to the private market. What\u2019s different about this cycle is that this is going to be a liquidity driven cycle. Companies are seeing a significant shock to both their revenue line, as well as their cost structure and they will need access to incremental forms of capital in order to get through and the strongest companies and more attractive companies, we are focusing on will also find ways to put capital to work offense to take share, consolidate, make high return on invested capital based decisions. And that\u2019s where we are focused. Our backlog of private opportunities across the firm is as rich as it\u2019s ever been and we really look forward to partnering with companies and management teams to provide them capital to get through this troubling time and to also strengthen their business as they think about how to improve coming out of the back end."

            "name": "Michael McFerran",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Hello, everyone and thank you for joining our call today. No words can do justice to explain the extraordinary and tragic nature of what\u2019s transpired in recent months and I hope all of you are safe and well. While we are doing this call from our respective offsite locations and I miss the in-person interaction with my colleagues. I will echo Mike\u2019s comments by saying that the power of our platform with a culture deeply rooted in collaboration has never been more evident or valuable than it is right now. While our global team continues to work remotely, our culture combined with our truly incredible technology and operations teams have a highly \u2013 operating highly effectively from our various locations. I will start my remarks with some key points in the quarter and then provide a more comprehensive review of our results and financial position. As Mike highlighted, the first quarter represented our 12th consecutive quarter of fee-related earnings growth and reflected some key first time milestones with fee-related earnings, exceeding $90 million, our margin growing to a new high of 34% and our fee-paying assets under management exceeding $100 billion. Valuations across most if not all asset classes globally have been negatively impacted our portfolios were not immune to the broad market dislocation as reduced valuations decreased our net accrued carry from yearend levels and reduce the value of our balance sheet portfolio. Although valuations were down as Mike stated our funds exceeded their public benchmark indices across our credit private equity and real estate strategies. Notwithstanding the challenging market backdrop realization stemming primarily from our private equity and real estate businesses enabled us to report $134.1 million of a realized income for the quarter which is our second highest quarter reported realized income since our IPO in 2014. Now I will take you through the results in more detail. Fee-related earnings for the quarter totaled $93.1 million, an increase of 31%from the first quarter of 2019 I will also note that this represents an increase of 5% for the last quarter which translates into a 20% annualized growth rate quarter over quarter. We are off to a good start to the year and I will reiterate our expectation that we expect to grow fee related earnings year over year by 15% or more. Fee-related earnings growth is driven by 17% of management fee growth from the prior year period compared to growth and combined compensation and general and administrative expenses of 12%. The faster growth of management fees versus expenses reflects the nature and life cycle of our revenue model the majority of our AUM from closed-end funds pays fees and deployed capital however we incur expenses on our capital raising investing and operating activities before we achieve rent revenue ramp as we are deploying the capital which is reflected in a AUM not yet paying fees or shadow AUM in other words we are growing management fees while much of the expense related to that revenue has already been reflected our prior financials. This enables us to continue to grow our margins which is highlighted by our FRE margin growing to 34% from 32% for the fourth quarter of last year and 30% for the for the first quarter of 2019. I do want to highlight that we are reiterating the 2020 margin guidance. We gave our call last quarter which is that we expect to report a 34% margin for the year and we would continue to expect to achieve a 35% or better run rate margin during 2020. With respect to general administrative expenses this quarter\u2019s results include approximately $3.3 million of expenses related to the ongoing SEC matter we discussed last quarter related to certain compliance policies and procedures. We believe this accounts for all the expenses we will incur related to this matter in our second quarter results were reflected insurance recovery of 2.5 million which offsets most of the expenses we recognize this quarter. Notwithstanding this we are seeing reduced G&A expenses as a result of the current environment most notably from reduced travel expenses. We do expect that through growing operational synergies including benefits we are capturing from our technology investments and from our Mumbai office that we opened last year that our full year 2020 G&A expenses should be flat or below the aggregate $178.7 million that we reported for 2019. Realized income for the quarter totaled $134.1 million which represents an increase of $29.5 million or 28% as compared to the first quarter of 2019. After-tax realized income per Class A common share, net of preferred stock distributions was $0.45 for the first quarter, an increase of 28% from the first quarter of 2019. On last quarter\u2019s call we highlighted that we estimate our 2020 effective tax rates to be in a 15% to 18% range for realized income and then the 11% to 8% range on fee related earnings assuming 100% of our shares were converted to Class A common basis we still think these estimates are appropriate for 2020. With respect to net performance income realizations going forward, we have moved from a general market backdrop that was favorable for realizations to one that is not at least for the near term. While there still will be opportunities for realized income to exceed fee related earnings this year current and anticipated market conditions for the foreseeable future are clearly far more conducive to making investments to grow long term value as opposed to harvesting gains today. Realizations during the first quarter combined with downward fair value adjustments as of March 31 did reduce our net accrued performance fees to $235.5 million at quarter end from $348.2 million as of December 31, 2019. Given our FRE centric business model, fluctuations in performance-related income have a minimal impact in our financial and liquidity position that do not affect our dividend, which as you know is pegged to FRE. Next, let me spend a few minutes in our AUM related metrics. Our AUM at March 31 totaled $148.6 billion compared to $148.9 billion at December 31. This is an increase of 9% from the prior year. AUM this quarter benefited from new capital commitments totaling $6.6 billion and our acquisition of CLO management contract agreements totaling $2.7 billion, which were offset by $5.7 billion of market value depreciation at $3.7 billion of distributions from income and realizations by our funds during the quarter. Going forward, we do expect AUM to be partially bolstered by the muted pace of realizations throughout the year. Our fee-paying AUM increased to over 17% year-over-year as a meaningful amount of our AUM has been converted to fee-paying AUM upon investment. We ended the first quarter with a $102 billion of fee-paying AUM, which is a great milestone as it represents the first time in our history that we have exceeded over $100 billion of fee-paying AUM. We ended the quarter with available capital of $33.2 billion, representing approximately 22% of our AUM as of quarter end and had $23.1 billion of AUM not yet paying fees, of which approximately $21 billion is available for future deployment with corresponding annual management fees totaling $199.8 million. The last metric I wanted to cover is incentive eligible AUM, which totaled $84.5 billion at quarter end. Of this amount, $22.4 billion was incentive generating at $25.9 billion was un-invested at quarter end. Well, asset price declines in the quarter reduced our accrued net performance fees as I previously referenced. We believe we are uniquely positioned to create meaningful long-term value for future performance fees. The combination of our dry powder are broad and diversified proprietary investment sourcing capabilities, the flexible nature of our funds, and most importantly, our culture that is deeply rooted in collaboration has us well positioned in this environment to make investments patiently in the quarters ahead that we believe will be a source of long-term performance fee generation in the years ahead. Before handing the call back to Mike, I do want to address our financial position as of quarter end. We ended the quarter with nearly $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents in our balance sheet with $800 million drawn against our $1.1 billion revolving credit facility due in 2025. This gives us more than $1.4 billion of available capital and quality as Mike mentioned. Subsequent to quarter end, we elected to reduce our borrowings and our revolver to $500 million. And after this pay down, we continue to have in excess of $850 million in cash on our balance sheet. We sit here today very well capitalized with no net debt, no near term debt maturities and no mark-to-market balance sheet leverage. We are very well equipped to be nimble and strategically focused to pursue what we believe will be a broad set of unusual opportunities to leverage our capital for growth in the time periods ahead. With that, I wish all of you and your families and loved ones, health and safety in this difficult time. I will hand the call back to Mike. I can take it, Mike. I think it was just about the structure of the ARCC Part 1 fee and the deferral mechanism I think it's important to be separate the two because they're two separate calculations around earning and deferring I think it's important that we differentiate between the fee getting earned and the fee getting paid. So the way that the part 1 fee works is it's calculated quarterly against the 7% hurdle pre incentive fee and then we compare that to the extent that it's above the 7% hurdle for the quarter we get a 20% part 1 incentive fee said by way of reference this quarter was about 9% against the 7%. There is also a kind of a nuanced deferral mechanism which frankly we inherited when the DDC went public in 2004 that is designed I think to be theoretically protect liquidity in that portfolio to the extent that you are seeing credit deterioration and income deterioration. And basically what it does is to the extent that it is earned, it then looks at your return of payments to shareholders and NAV as to whether or not to pay it. And so there could be situations and we saw this in 2009 where even though the book is performing and paying cash interest and therefore able to support the payment of the incentive fee and the payment of the dividend, it traps the fee. But the fee is earned and then gets paid out at a later date. What\u2019s unique about the calculation is it\u2019s a four quarter look back and then it resets on the new NAV. So basically what happens is if you were to trap that fee, it would likely pay out starting a year later when you were in that new, that new NAV hurdle. So if you look at our history, the Part 1 incentive fee has been earned every quarter since ARCC went public. And then the deferral mechanism obviously is just a function of unrealized losses, which either come back or resets your NAV and then it pays. So I don\u2019t know if that was too complicated or not, Craig, but it\u2019s a little bit of a nuanced. Just to reiterate, Craig, I think you saw ARCC announced earnings yesterday and obviously we are not in a deferral situation. Sorry operator. Sure. The funds that I think fell out of incentive generating this quarter were there is only three what I would call our flagship funds across all of our businesses, two in private equity, one in real estate and all three of those funds are funds still in their investment period. They fell below the pref returns, but again, where they were in their lifecycle. There were funds, I would call, in carry harvesting mode. If you look at where our crude carry was at year end than it is today, it\u2019s mostly concentrated with funds are still generating and past their investment period with most of those being in both private equity and real estate. Yes happy to I think we talked about in our prepared remarks. Clearly the balance sheets flush with cash that combined with undrawn access on a revolver 1.4 billion plus of liquidity so feel great about our liquidity position we have no mark to market leverage which I highlighted which is important because there's no exposed flank where we have to worry about funding margin calls or similar types of repayments under. We have no near term debt maturities you probably would have seen we amended each year we usually roll our revolver so our corporate credit facility is now through 2025 so I think from our end from a full balance sheet standpoint where years out from our next bond maturity and have a lot of capital so I think we feel really, really good about that. As far as commitments, we do have GP commitments to our funds, a fairly decent amount of those are held by our employees that invests side-by-side with Ares Management in our funds. We fairly have the settlement of closing of SSG which we have previously disclosed primarily stock and [indiscernible] closed of that transaction with [indiscernible] previously described the amounts. Outside of that, there is other real what I would call contractual liquidity requirements. It\u2019s going to be really more about we have access to a lot of capital for opportunities."

I mean, we definitely see competition in that space significantly weakened for the most part. We see a lot of competition that\u2019s having difficulty dealing with outstanding commitments, providing liquidity to existing portfolio of companies and when the concept of the new deal comes forward, it\u2019s kind of a non-starter. We are in exactly the opposite position and then we have deployed in the U.S. and Europe north of $2 billion since March 1 in a lot of the opportunity sets that Mike outlined. So we are very much in business for new deals although there are fewer of them. I mean, there are lot of other things to do in the current environment that are pretty exciting."

This morning, we announced that we declared our first quarter dividend of $0.61 per share of its Class A and nonvoting common stock, representing an increase of 30% over the same quarter a year ago. The dividend will be paid on March 31, 2022, to holders of record on March 17. Now I will turn the call over to Michael Arougheti, who will start with some quarterly and year-end financial and business highlights.\nMichael Arougheti: Thank you, Carl, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope everybody is doing well. Our strong fourth quarter results capped off a transformational year here at Ares. We generated record results across nearly every key financial metric. We saw tremendous growth across our global platform and our best fund performance since we became a public company. As we outlined at our Investor Day last year, we are operating in expansive and rapidly growing end markets, and we're gaining share through our scale, product and geographic expansion and new distribution. We believe that our global platform and our unique culture of collaboration and innovation are key drivers of our firm\u2019s success. We ended the year exceeding $300 billion in AUM, 55% higher than the near $200 billion in AUM at the end of 2020. The vast majority of this AUM growth was organic and driven by a record $77 billion in gross fundraising, including $25 billion in the fourth quarter alone, well ahead of our expectations. Our strong organic growth, which we believe to be among the best in our industry over the past 3 years, reflects our investor satisfaction with our fund performance and the continued expansion of our capabilities and strategies. On top of the strong organic growth, we added $33 billion in AUM from the strategic acquisitions of Landmark Partners and Black Creek Group. These businesses are performing very well and have positioned us for significant future growth across an increasingly diversified set of strategies. We're already seeing exciting revenue and earnings synergies with Black Creek and Landmark under our ownership as we collaborate to positively impact fundraising, investing and fund performance. In addition, in December, we agreed to acquire AMP's Infrastructure Debt platform, which is one of the largest global infrastructure debt platforms with approximately $8 billion of AUM and with a strong and long-term investment track record. We were pleased to announce the closing of this transaction last night, and we're excited with the extraordinary support that we received from the Infrastructure Debt platform\u2019s existing LPs. The addition of the infra-debt team will expand our investment capabilities across the digital, utilities and transportation sectors and will enhance our existing capabilities in the renewable energy space. The growing scale and breadth of our investment capabilities were on full display as we invested more than $80 billion for the full year across more than 25 different strategies around the globe. Our deployment, record fundraising and 2 strategic acquisitions all helped drive a nearly 50% year-over-year increase in our fee paying AUM and a 65% increase in our full year fee-related earnings which accounted for more than 80% of our realized income. Our FRE margins continued to expand throughout '21, approaching 40% in the fourth quarter, an improvement of over 250 basis points year-on-year. And over the past 5 years, our FRE margins have now expanded by more than 1,200 basis points. Our prospects for continued growth across all 5 of our business groups remain bright. With $90 billion of available capital to invest and a robust fundraising pipeline, we have strong visibility for continued growth in earnings over the coming years. Given our high conviction on our outlook, we're increasing our quarterly dividend by 30%, as Carl stated. This conviction is supported by a promising long-term view on the secular growth in alternative investments as institutional, retail and insurance investors are all seeking differentiated sources of income with less market volatility. Each of these channels is expected to support the double-digit annual market growth in the alternative asset sector over the next 5 years as alternatives continue to take share from the global pool of hundreds of trillions of dollars of investment assets available. Inflation concerns and expectations for higher rates have no doubt generated some recent market volatility. In the past, we've demonstrated our ability to achieve significant growth even through volatile periods like the global financial crisis and the recent COVID pandemic. We've also effectively navigated interest rate volatility in past cycles, and we continue to believe that Ares is well positioned given the generally floating rate nature of our credit assets, the growth orientation of our private equity portfolios and the inflation protection inherent in our real asset book. We continue to see investors consolidating their manager relationships with broader platforms to gain efficiencies and strategic insight. To that point, over 80% of our direct institutional fundraising in 2021 was derived from existing investors, either reupping into one of our existing strategies, which accounted for 45% of direct institutional fundraising, or investing in other Ares strategies across our platform, which accounted for 39% of direct institutional fundraising. Today, 62% of our institutional direct AUM is from clients that are invested across our platform in 2 or more investment groups, up from 49% of our clients 5 years ago. We also continue to attract new investors onto the platform. Out of the total 427 direct institutional investors who committed to new funds in '21, 41% of them were new to Ares. Our goal is to bring new investors onto the platform, deliver a best-in-class experience and performance and then earn additional trust and wallet share in subsequent fund offerings. We saw this play out in 2021 as the average investment size for existing investors increased 35% year-over-year and was over 3x as large as the average investment size for new investors. This increasing momentum with our investors culminated in a record fourth quarter fundraising with more than $25 billion of capital raised. This included $3.7 billion for the final close of our second senior direct lending fund, SDL II, bringing total fund commitments to approximately $14 billion, including leveraged and unleveraged sleeves. We believe this single fund is one of the largest ever private funds raised in the U.S. direct lending market. We held a final close for our inaugural Climate Infrastructure Fund, ASIP, raising $1.2 billion in the quarter and bringing total commitments to $2.2 billion, including related vehicles. Investing in renewables through the energy transition remains a significant focus and a great opportunity for us in the future. We also closed on commitments for several newly launched vintages of existing funds. In our second special opportunities fund, we raised $4.9 billion in the fourth quarter and are well on our way to the hard cap of $6 billion. In our secondaries business, we raised nearly $800 million of initial commitments following the launch of our ninth Landmark Real Estate secondaries fund. And in Asia, Ares SSG raised over $800 million of initial commitments following the launch of our sixth Special Situations Fund. We also continue to experience significant fundraising momentum in our Perpetual Capital Funds with more than $5 billion raised in the fourth quarter, including $3 billion raised in the retail channel and $2 billion in the institutional open-ended channel. Our 2 nontraded REITs and the institutional open-end industrial Real Estate Fund that we acquired from Black Creek are all running well ahead of our expectations with more than $2 billion raised in Q4. So looking back over 2021, our record $77 billion of fundraising far exceeded 2020's record of $41 billion. During the year, we held final or meaningful closings on over a dozen flagship funds totaling nearly $35 billion. Interestingly, our flagship funds that held a final closing in 2021 increased their committed equity by approximately 50% in the aggregate over prior vintages, highlighting the embedded growth potential that we have from scaling existing funds. But even with an impressive year in flagship fundraising, we raised more funds outside of our flagship commingled products, including $21 billion in our perpetual capital vehicles, which now represent over 25% of total AUM. We're seeing accelerated growth across our various distribution channels, particularly in retail and insurance. While aggregate fundraising increased 86% year-over-year, fundraising in our retail channel increased over 150% year-over-year to $14.5 billion. And AUM from our retail and high net worth channel stood at more than $50 billion at year-end. Fundraising from insurance clients increased over 100% to $11.7 billion as we continue to develop products and expand our client service teams to target these investors. In the retail channel, the formation of Ares Wealth Management Solutions is enhancing our ability to drive additional flows into our existing funds and has now positioned us to launch new Perpetual Capital Funds. We are rebranding the Black Creek Funds, including the Diversified Property Fund, which is now Ares Real Estate Income Trust, or AREIT, and Black Creek industrial REIT 4, which is in the process of being rebranded as the Ares Industrial Real Estate Income Trust. Our Ares Wealth Management Solutions team is also actively working to expand product distribution with wirehouses, regional broker-dealers and RIAs in the U.S., Europe and Asia. In late '21, our insurance affiliate, Aspida, completed the acquisition of an additional insurance company, enabling Aspida to begin writing new annuity and insurance contracts, which is expected to begin late in the second quarter of this year. While there will be a ramp-up period, we expect to see stronger growth in Aspida over time as our organic sales organization will complement our reinsurance flow arrangements and potential block acquisitions. At year-end, Aspida had $3.4 billion of assets managed by Ares Insurance Solutions with more than 40% sub-advised across the Ares platform. Looking forward to 2022, we expect to have more than 25 different funds in the market, including the launch of some new fund strategies. We now have 23 commingled fund series that have closed on $1 billion or more in their latest fund vintage. This is up over 4.5x from only 5 fund series in 2016. And while we expect another strong year of fundraising in 2022, we don't expect to approach our 2021 record, particularly given the record amount of available capital that we have to invest. Our global origination footprint and increased scale is enabling us to invest in larger transactions across more geographies and across broader strategies. In addition, the private markets continue to scale which has created an opportunity to serve larger companies and sponsors as the global markets expand and evolve across the waterfront in direct lending, alternative credit, real estate credit infrastructure credit and special situations among others. So as these markets go through transformational change, we feel confident that we're gaining share and addressing investor needs with flexible solutions. For the fourth quarter, we had gross capital deployment of $32 billion, another record quarter and nearly double the $17.3 billion of gross deployment in Q4 2020. For the full year, we deployed over $80 billion in flexible capital with an emphasis on industries and assets that are cycle resilient like health care, software and technology, business services and other service industries on the corporate side, industrial and multifamily properties in real estate and renewable energy within infrastructure. Of note, we invested more than $48 billion in our U.S. and European direct lending and alternative credit strategies during the year. Our full year fund performance across every investment group was some of the strongest that we've experienced as a public company. Private equity returns in both our Ares Core of our Opportunities fund series and Special Opportunities Fund were excellent and meaningfully outperformed the broader U.S. equity market indices. Our ACOF composite generated gross returns of 7.5% in the fourth quarter and 52.6% for the full year, while Ares Special Opportunities generated gross returns of 4.5% in the quarter and 45.9% for the full year. Real estate continued its outstanding performance as the U.S. real estate equity composite generated gross returns in the fourth quarter of 10.7% and 62.3% for the full year, and our European real estate equity composite had gross returns of 5.8% in the quarter and 34.2% for the full year. In our non-traded REITs, for the full year, Black Creek Industrial REIT 4 delivered a net return of 29.7% for its Class I shares and AREIT generated a 13.8% net return for Class I shares. Our secondary strategy kept pace with strong performance across the board. The private equity secondary strategy, which reports results on a 1-quarter lag basis, generated gross returns of 13.9% for the quarter and 60% for the trailing 12-month period, while real estate secondaries generated gross returns of 18.7% for the quarter and 49.7% over the trailing 12 months on a 1-quarter lag basis. Pathfinder, which is our flagship alternative credit fund, has generated a very strong net IRR of 49% since its inception in 2020. What makes this performance particularly exciting is that 10% of the incentive fee income from this fund has been donated by the portfolio managers and by Ares to support charitable initiatives such as global poverty, health and education. Our flagship U.S. direct lending fund, Ares Capital Corporation, generated strong net returns of 4.6% in the fourth quarter and 22% for the year. Our European direct lending strategy generated gross returns of 2.5% for the quarter and 14.5% for the year. In liquid credit, our syndicated loan and high-yield bond composites generated gross returns of 6.3% and 6.9% for the year, respectively, outperforming their respective benchmarks by 15% and 29%. Our flagship global multi-asset credit strategy also generated a gross return of 12.8% for the year. And lastly, in Asia, our Special Situations Fund Composite, generated a gross return of 6.8% in the quarter and 30.2% for the full year. Hopefully, these returns illustrate that we have highly talented, motivated people driving differentiated investment outcomes for our clients across all of our strategies and highlight why we continue to enjoy a sticky and growing client base. And with that, now let me turn the call over to Jared to walk through the fourth quarter and the full year financial results. Jarrod?\nJarrod Phillips: Thanks, Mike. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss yet another great year for Ares. I'll start with a review of the fourth quarter and the full year, and then I'll provide an update on our outlook. As Mike stated, we experienced impressive growth in nearly every financial metric, including management fees, fee-related earnings, realized income, AUM, FPAUM and net accrued performance income for both the fourth quarter and the full year. In 2021, we demonstrated not only the power of our existing platform, but the ability to execute on acquisitions further adding to our competitive advantage and scope. We also began to showcase the earnings power of our perpetual capital vehicles, which contributed significantly to our fourth quarter. On that last point, I would like to highlight that our revenues in FRE now include the addition of fee-related performance revenues, or FRPR, for the fourth quarter and full year. FRPR refers to recurring performance revenues derived from perpetual capital funds that are not dependent on realizations and typically are measured and crystallized annually in the fourth quarter. This better aligns with reporting by our peers who operate funds with similar fees, including nontraded REITs and other evergreen fund structures. Starting with our revenues. Our management fee increased 44% for the fourth quarter and 38% for the full year, driven primarily by the strong deployment of our invested capital, as Mike highlighted. In addition, another $18 billion of AUM in funds raised during the year became fee pay. Our management fee stability is a key differentiator for our business model and allows us to better manage market dislocation. As of year-end, 95% of our management fees came from either perpetual capital or long-dated funds, greatly reducing the risk of redemptions even during severe market movements. With deployment accelerating means we scale our strategies, we believe that we remain very well positioned to continue this growth. Other fee income increased to approximately $22.4 million for the fourth quarter and $50 million for 2021, up 219% and 150%, respectively. This sharp increase is primarily due to the Black Creek acquisition, which in addition to management fees, FRP and realized performance income generates development, leasing and acquisition fees, which are recorded in other fee income. Our other fees also include our capital structuring and origination fees in certain of our direct lending perpetual funds. For the full year 2021, we had $137.9 million of FRPR compared to only $23 million for the full year 2020. Strong contribution from FRPR in 2021, of which about 98% came in the fourth quarter, was primarily driven by a significant ramp and strong performance in our U.S. and European direct lending perpetual managed accounts, which contributed over $85 million and the addition of 2 Black Creek nontraded REITs that collectively contributed over $48 million. Of note, since we closed the acquisition of Black Creek on July 1, 2021, we only received our proportionate share of the FRPR from the 2 nontraded REITs during our ownership in 2021, or approximately 50% of the contractual annual performance revenues. For 2022 and beyond, we would receive the full year payout of such fees. Note that our FRPR, net of related compensation, contributed $51 million to our 2021 FRE compared to only $6.8 million in 2020. Based on the nature of these funds as described, we would not expect to see meaningful FRPR until the fourth quarter of 2022. For the fourth quarter, FRE totaled $253.3 million, an increase of 85% from the fourth quarter of 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, FRE totaled $712.3 million, an increase of approximately 65% from the prior year, and it accounted for more than 80% of our realized income, up from 74% in 2020. Our FRE margin for the year ended December 31, 2021, was 39%. And for the fourth quarter, totaled 39.7%. This represents a 400 basis point increase in our full year margin as compared to the full year 2020. As expected, our realization activity picked back up in the fourth quarter, particularly within our Credit and Real Estate Groups. Our Credit Group generated $45 million in net realized performance income, which was nearly 2.5x the fourth quarter of 2020. This included performance income from our U.S. and European direct lending strategies and $10 million in net ARCC Part 2 capital gains fees. Real estate net realized performance income also increased over 2.5x fourth quarter 2020, driven by strong results in monetizations in U.S. real estate equity funds, including Black Creek's institutional funds. Overall, net realized performance income for the fourth quarter increased 49% year-over-year and full year results were up 17% versus the prior year. Realized income for the fourth quarter totaled a record $340.3 million, up over 80% from the fourth quarter of 2020 and over 60% higher than our previous record. For the full year, realized income totaled $882.9 million, a 52% increase from 2020. After-tax realized income per share of Class A common stock was $0.85 for the fourth quarter, up from $0.54 in the fourth quarter of 2020 and full year 2020 after-tax realized income of $2.57 per share of Class A stock was up 38% versus 2020. At the beginning of each year, we look to set our quarterly dividend at a fixed level for the coming year. Based on the significant outperformance of our fee-related earnings relative to our dividends and our continued strong growth prospects, we've elected to increase our quarterly dividend to $0.61 per share of Class A stock or $2.44 annually, up 30% from the $1.88 per share for 2021. This 30% growth for 2022 is ahead of the 20%-plus long-term cumulative annual growth rate guidance we gave at our Investor Day last August. We believe it is appropriate given our strong visibility from our significant dry powder for deployment, fundraising pipeline and full year accretion from our Black Creek and Landmark acquisitions. As of year-end, our AUM totaled $306 billion compared to $282 billion for the third quarter and $197 billion as of the year ended 2020, this represents a 55% increase year-over-year and our highest annual AUM growth rate as a public company. The main drivers of this increase in 2021 included $77 billion in gross new capital commitments as well as $33 billion from strategic acquisitions completed in the year. Our fee-paying AUM totaled $188 billion at year-end, an increase of approximately 9% from the third quarter and nearly 50% from year-end 2020. Our growth in fee-paying AUM was primarily driven by meaningful deployment in our global direct lending, special opportunities and alternative credit strategies, which are paid on invested capital along with $30 billion in fee-paying AUM from Landmark and Black Creek. With market volatility rising as we enter 2022, we stand ready to take advantage of any opportunities that may arise based on our record levels of available capital and AUM not yet earning fees. Our available capital increased to a new record high of $90.4 billion, an increase of over 61% year-over-year, primarily driven by fundraising in our direct lending and special opportunity strategies. In addition, we ended the year with $53 billion of AUM not yet paying fees available for future deployment. Approximately 75% of this balance is housed in our credit strategy, including over $32 billion in direct lending and $7 billion in alternative credit. Our incentive eligible AUM increased by 56% from the year-end of 2020 to $183 billion. Of this amount, $70.4 billion was uninvested at year-end. In the fourth quarter, we continued to experience appreciation in our net accrued performance income balance, which now sits at $808 million. This represents a 10% increase from the third quarter and 130% increase from the end of 2020. Of this $808 million of net accrued performance income at year-end, approximately 60% was in European-style waterfall funds. As we highlighted at our Investor Day in August, we have a substantial and growing balance of European-style waterfall funds, that accrued performance fees but pay most of their performance fees in the final years of the fund life. In 2022 and ramping up thereafter, we expect to see an increase in these realized performance fees from older vintage European style funds as they mature. As we continue to raise additional European style funds, the base of future performance income should continue to increase. In fact, we have raised an additional $20.5 billion of European waterfall style funds that were not incorporated into our forecast from Investor Day. From an organizational standpoint, we plan to reorient our reporting segments to better align with our platform expansion. Following the closing of our Infrastructure Debt acquisition, we will combine our real estate group with our newly expanded Infrastructure Debt and Equity platform. This combination will create a new real assets group reporting segment. On an as-adjusted basis, this new group would have total AUM of $53.9 billion and FPAUM of $33.4 billion at year-end, which includes our existing real estate strategies, $4.8 billion in AUM and $4.5 billion in FPAUM from infrastructure and power that currently resides in private equity and approximately $8 billion of AUM and $5 billion of FPAUM from the Infrastructure Debt platform acquisition. Before I turn the call back to Mike, let me touch on our forward outlook. As you will recall, we gave investors some longer-term guidance at our Investor Day last August. We continue to believe we are on track to reach our $500 billion plus AUM target by 2025, and our 20% or more compound annual growth in FRE, and our 20% or more compound annual growth in our dividend per share of Class A common stock through 2025. Lastly, we continue to expect to reach our goal of a 45%-plus FRE run rate margin by 2025. With significant headcount growth planned in 2022 to meet our longer-term AUM target, we expect our FRE margin expansion will moderate this year.  This was truly a momentous year for our firm with many transformative developments and record results across the board. I'll now turn the call back over to Mike for his thoughts and concluding remarks.\nMichael Arougheti: Thanks, Jarrod. Based on the foundation that's already been laid with our investment teams, our fundraising pipeline and our current available capital, we have good visibility that the next several years are going to be quite strong for our business. In addition, the synergies and earnings contributions from our recent acquisitions in the aggregate are running ahead of our expectations and we expect these trends to continue. That said, we will continue to invest to expand and enhance our core businesses, higher investment talent and grow our business development, Investor Relations and noninvestment support in order to maintain strong growth in the years ahead. We'll also be continuing to add to our ESG and DEI team as we continue to focus on our impact at Ares and integrate our ESG values across every aspect of our firm. We believe that this makes us a stronger more cohesive workforce, better investors and allows us to strive to make a positive impact for all of our stakeholders. As it relates to potential new acquisitions, the strategic transactions announced in 2021 filled specific product gaps in areas that we identified as high-growth opportunities. Our product breadth and scaled operations provide us a significant platform from which to build businesses organically, and as a result, the bar for new M&A is higher. We expect to be active in the organic build-out of products across each of our business lines, including optimizing the synergy opportunities in our recent acquisitions that will hopefully further enhance our growth. I want to end just by expressing how impressed by, proud of and grateful for all of the hard work and dedication of our team, how grateful I am for everything they're doing every day to deliver for our stakeholders. I'm also deeply appreciative of all of our investors' continuing support for our company, and thank you for the time today. And operator, with that, could you please open up the line for questions?\nOperator: . Our first question will come from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America Securities.\nCraig Siegenthaler: So I want to start with Black Creek. It was nice to see its third place finish in the fundraising league table last year, but I wanted to see if you could comment on your ability to get the private REIT on more distribution platforms and really leverage your larger network effect and cross-sell into more intermediary channels? And also how this could potentially impact fundraising year-over-year?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, it's a good question. Obviously, that's part of the core investment thesis for the acquisition is to leverage the client service organization that already exists into a broader set of relationships, both in the U.S. but also in Europe and Asia. We're far along on that. We're having productive conversations with a number of other platforms. I think the good news there is our interval fund, CADEX, which is also enjoying good growth in the channel is already on multiple platforms given our traded vehicles. We have very strong brand awareness within those channels and platforms and relationships with the adviser community. And through our high net worth sales effort, there's great familiarity with the product set up and down The Street. So we're working on it. I'm optimistic that we'll continue to make headway there. And obviously, as we add new platforms, and build it out, it should have a pretty meaningful impact on fundraising. I'd also maybe articulate for those that don't know, if you really look at the growth in the channel as important as it is to be on the wires and grow, the RIA channel is actually growing at a faster pace and represents as significant as an opportunity, and that's a place where we've already had some pretty meaningful success.\nCraig Siegenthaler: And then, Michael, just as my follow-up, you hit on the trade vehicles, but speaking on ARCC for a moment. You have a huge public BDC. You have a huge private credit origination business. Why not launch a private BDC to supplement the public BDC in your existing business?\nMichael Arougheti : Yes. It's a good question. We think that the nontraded BDC product is a really interesting product. And as you've seen us do across the platform over time is we're constantly looking for ways to grow and diversify our funding sources. It's not lost on us just what the appetite for those types of strategies are in the growing nontraded channel.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlexander Blostein: I wanted to start maybe with a question around deployment dynamics for Ares. You guys had a record year in deployment last year. Obviously, the environment has gotten a little bit more bumpy to start 2022. So how are you thinking about deployment opportunities as a whole? Obviously, a lot of the direct lending business is predicated on financial hunters being active. Are you seeing any signs of that activity slow down? And if you do, maybe you could expand on what are the things you guys are doing to expand into non-sponsored based part of the market?\nMichael Arougheti: So a general comment on deployment. Obviously, a driver of deployment is in our private credit strategy. So I'll make sure that we talk about that specifically. But hopefully, it's not lost on people that one of the reasons why we are driving the levels of deployment that we are is just the investments that we continue to make in expanding our global origination footprint and broadening out our capability set. So while the private credit markets continue to be a big driver of that, when you look broadly across the platform, there's a very diversified mix to where we're deploying both from an asset class and geographical perspective. And I think importantly, when you look at the mix of product, we're able to deploy and generate return regardless of the market backdrop. With regard to private credit specifically, and Kipp touched on this a little bit on the ARCC earnings call, 2021 was a very strong year of deployment. Some of that is a function of kind of call it post-COVID rebound and just some pent-up transaction demand coming out of the lockdown, and some of it was probably a little bit tax driven. I think it's too early to tell as we sit here in February as to what 2022 will hold. I'd remind people that private credit flows tend to be a little seasonal. If you look over our history, Q4 and Q2 tend to be significant deployment quarters relative to a summer slowdown and a little bit of a lull that we typically see at the beginning of the year. So it's hard to say if there's a loan now that's seasonal or as Kipp articulated on the BDC earnings call, there's just a little bit of a pause as people are price discovering given the rate backdrop. I would not though discount the power and weight of dry powder that exists in the market across the institutional, corporate and real asset equity space and what that really means for more consistent transaction volumes. You had a question with regard to -- there's 1 last question, I missed about private.\nAlexander Blostein: So yes, yes, the non-sponsor, right. So the predominant portion of the business, I think it's sponsor-led. So just curious how you\u2019re thinking about expanding there?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. So we have a very significant non-sponsored business that's geared direct to corporates and organized by industry, where we have teams that are focused on health care and life sciences lending, sports, media and entertainment lending, consumer and retail. And that's been a growing part of our deployment. When you look at it in dollar terms, it's significant, particularly relative to the peers when you look at it as percentage terms, it just can't ever really move the needle given the market position that we have in the sponsor side of the business. So we are making investments there on the corporate side. It is bearing significant fruit and I expect to see that grow. And then obviously, when you look at where growth is coming away from corporates, our infrastructure debt businesses, our real estate lending businesses, our alternative credit businesses are also a healthy mix of sponsor and non-sponsored and we're pretty active there as well.\nAlexander Blostein: Great. Second question, just around the numbers. I wanted to begin a little bit more to the performance fees that are now sitting within FRE. You guys gave a little bit of color on kind of why you decided to go down the path, that makes sense. I was hoping to maybe get a couple of underwriting drivers behind it, so what's kind of the right asset base we should be thinking about within credit, in particular, that will drive this, I guess, every Q4? What's the hurdle rate that we should be thinking about? And just broadly speaking, kind of how do you think about the consistency of the growth in these perpetual SMA vehicles and credit that will -- sounds like these are of additional piece we\u2019re able to \nJarrod Phillips: Sure, Alex. Thanks. And it's really 2 pieces that you laid out. It's about 2/3 of what we recorded in the credit side and about 1/3 over in the real estate side on the nontraded REITs. In terms of the credit where you asked the question, that has been a growing part of our portfolio and the perpetual capital resulting from those SMAs has grown pretty significantly over the last few years, and this is the first time that this really became a material component. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, it was something that we wanted to make sure was in line with how our peers were reporting. Those are standard incentive fee type arrangements where they're earned and crystallized on an annual basis based on unrealized and interest income and realizations would be included in there, too, but it is not dependent on those realizations, like carried interest would be. And so every year, as we reach the end of the year, that's the typical time when they're going to crystallize, they'll be measured against that hurdle, which is going to be in that 6% to 8% range. We've continued to see growth in those SMAs for that product, both in U.S. and Europe. And as we continue to have a larger growth that we will hopefully see more in that line item as well. And the other thing I'd add is that these are all primarily illiquid. So these aren't liquid assets that underlie these perpetual capital vehicles, they are illiquid direct lending loans.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: Maybe just following up on Alex's question there on the non-sponsor side. You mentioned that it's significant in dollar term, just hoping you could help quantify that. And you mentioned that it can't necessarily move the needle today given your position on the sponsor side. But I guess as you look out over the next 5 to 10 years, what are your ambitions and aspirations on the non-sponsor side? Where would you like that to be in terms of your ideal mix of the business? And maybe you could talk about some of the initiatives that you have going on there as you think about executing on that.\nMichael Arougheti : Sure. Thanks, Michael. So again, not being a needle mover, maybe that's subjective, so I'm glad you kind of asked about the quantification, but just to zoom out quickly. We have to make sure that when we're talking about private credit and direct lending that we include all of our private credit businesses, which are all in growth mode. And so when we look at private credit. Yes, there's the corporate piece that's germane to your question, but meaningful business in real estate lending, that's now in expansion mode geographically and from a product set, infrastructure, debt and obviously, with the addition of our new partners at AMP, new growth opportunity. Asian direct lending and special sits so on and so forth. So those businesses tend to be less sponsor-driven and more direct to company. So I want to make sure that as people are thinking about non-sponsored deployment that, that at least factors into the conversation. If you were to narrow the focus and just say in the core direct lending to corporates business, right now, non-sponsored flow represents about 10% of our deployment. So call it, $3 billion to $4 billion, and that has been growing year-over-year. The types of investments we're making, as I said, and I'll just restate them, software and technology, life sciences and health care, sports, media and entertainment, consumer retail, there are dedicated teams that work hand-in-hand with the sponsor groups to originate into the direct to corporate, but also to support from an industry and subject matter expertise standpoint. So it's a twofold benefit in building out those direct-to-company industry teams.\nMichael Cyprys: And just any sense on overall AUM, would you say, in the non-sponsor side today? And as you think about the mix, where would you like that to be kind of looking out longer term for the business?\nMichael Arougheti : I don't actually have access to the number. We could take that offline and find it for you. I don't -- and I'll ask you if there's something that you'd like to get at in terms of a view on the value of non-sponsored flow versus sponsored flow? I think our teams would generally say they're agnostic. There comes different risks and different return, whether you're making a sponsor-backed loan or a loan direct to a corporate and that always gets factored into how we price and structure those investments. There's obviously value in developing deep corporate relationships directly and surrounding those relationships with a broader product set across our entire platform. But it's not as though we go into any given year and say, the stated goal is to deploy X into sponsored and X into -- Y into non-sponsored. So if there's something that you're trying to get at in terms of some trends you're seeing or value perception of non-sponsored versus sponsored, happy to clarify.\nMichael Cyprys : Sure. Maybe it kind of gets to any sort of -- I'd be curious your views on perceptions around the cyclicality of the sponsor side relative to the non-sponsor, just given the dependence on private equity deployment and trends there? And also any sort of views on probability of default and recovery values. So those 2 different sides of the private credit business.\nMichael Arougheti: Got it. Yes. So I believe, personally, and we've been, I'd say, at the forefront of the development of the direct lending market now for almost 30 years. I don't -- I believe that cyclicality in the sponsored lending market is reducing year-over-year. That's a function of just the evolution and maturation of that market. There are more sponsors and more markets with more dry powder that are actively looking for private market solutions. And so I think you'll see volatility in that market reducing over time as the market continues to evolve and mature. I personally, based on my own experience, would say that the risk of default or maybe the risk of loss given default is higher in the non-sponsored space. And one of the big benefits of lending into the institutional equity community, whether it's for real assets or corporates is the amount of dry powder that's there could be diverted to provide credit support. And we saw that play out in spades across the entire private credit book here through 2020 and 2021 as the equity owners stepped up to support their companies in a way that non-sponsored owners sometimes can't. In terms of volume, if you look at just sheer corporate direct lending volume in the U.S., we looked at $500 billion of transaction volume in 2021 in our U.S. business. So the market is growing. It's increasing. There are more transactions, more line items. And so I don't perceive it to be as sick with coal may be as we would have told you it was 20 years ago.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Gerry O'Hara with Jefferies.\nGerald O'Hara: Mike, maybe picking up a little bit on your comments around M&A and kind of focusing on, obviously, what's at hand, but also kind of appreciating a higher bar. Just curious if you do still see some gaps in the lineup? Clearly a much more diversified business now than you were 3, 5 years ago. But curious to just sort of get your thoughts on what that landscape might look like with -- even with that higher bar.\nMichael Arougheti : Yes. Thanks, Gerry. So if you go back and look at some of the things we talked about at our Investor Day, the acquisitions that we're attracted to tend to be in high-growth markets and asset classes where we have a little bit of a sense of urgency to participate in that growth, but making these acquisitions with a very high conviction that we can then organically grow them. So once these acquisitions come online here and get integrated, they become high-growth organic growth stories for us, and you can begin to see that playing out in each of our acquired businesses. So now given how active we've been, we now have lots more growth engines organically, not just in our core legacy businesses, but some of the organic businesses as well. And as financially attractive and accretive as these acquisitions have been given where we're able to buy them, obviously, we can generate very high ROEs through organic expansion. As I sit here today, I don't see any, what I would call, glaring gaps in the product set or the geographies that we play in or the distribution capability. So the types of things that we would do opportunistically would be to fill in adjacent to some of the core businesses. So places where you might see us active as we continue to build out the product set in Asia as an example, or as we continue to globalize our intra business as we integrate A&P and continue to build on the success we're having in our climate business. So there's going to be some places where you may want to do something inorganic versus organic. But I'd say the sense of urgency just given how much opportunity we have now in the portfolio is a lot less than it had been a couple of years ago.\nGerald O'Hara: That's completely fair. And Jarrod, maybe just one for you. You kind of looking over the trailing 4 quarters here, the tax rate, probably a little ebbs and flows, we'll call it. But can you just kind of remind us as to how you, all things equal, how we should think about that kind of going forward for '22 and '23?\nJarrod Phillips: Sure. I'd say it's always important to kind of look at the full year when you're thinking about that because realizations that happen with any -- within any given quarter are going to cause increases to the amount of taxes that we ultimately have to pay as we approach more a statutory rate of about 24%. As we look out over future years, our current cash tax experience, I think will be pretty consistent, and that has the ability, obviously, as we have more of those realizations to approach closer to that statutory rate of 24%. So you kind of look at and take that full year, I think it's about 12% is the current ratio of cash taxes paid. And then as we get more realizations, that would increase.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Adam Beatty with UBS.\nAdam Beatty: I wanted to ask about kind of the development and evolution of the strategy in Asia Pacific, which I think at least partly by intention was sort of a theme in some of the inorganic growth that you've had recently. Specifically, if you could touch on the geographies of Australia, where you have partnerships in distribution as well as obviously, product now. Also in China, and how you see the opportunities there versus political risk? And any broader comments around Asia Pac.\nMichael Arougheti: Thanks, Adam. So we have been in Asia for a dozen years. Our early intensive growth in that market were largely focused around U.S. dollar and RMB growth equity investing in China, and learn through that experience just how important it was to be broader in terms of our product set and geographic positioning, which really led us to the acquisition of SSG and the current strategy for growth there. So we are active today in the private credit markets across the region. Southeast Asia, India, a little bit in China, and to an increasing extent in Australia and New Zealand. And as you are articulating with your question, Asia is a big place with a lot of regulatory complexity, cultural complexity, market differentiation, geography by geography. And so we think it's critical to have people in local markets. That has proved to be particularly important through the pandemic. Travel restrictions in Asia have really highlighted just how critical it is to have boots on the ground in these markets that are able to deploy and asset manage actively. And I think that's been a big driver of our performance as we articulated our special sits composite in excess of 30% returns last year. We do see a growing opportunity in Australia and New Zealand. We've been investing in growth. They are actively collaborating across our platform, alternative credit, special ops and private equity are all actively collaborating with our Australia team. We are building out what I would call a more traditional corporate lending business and sponsor lending business in that part of the market just given that it is more evolved, more mature and more developed relative to other parts of the Asia region. China, we have folks on the ground in the local market. I would say, at a very high level, it's a balance. I believe strongly that we need to be there, building local relationships and capability. But given some of the capital markets and the political/regulatory risk, you have to be measured about ambitions in that market, which is kind of how we're approaching it. That said, we have a pretty meaningful advantage just in terms of the longevity of our teams in that market, some of the licenses that we have that position us for opportunity in the region in a way that others frankly can access. I personally am pretty excited about some of the volatility that we're going to see emerge in that market on the heels of Evergrande and some of the real estate challenges, particularly given the special sits positioning of our business there. My hope is that, that's going to create a pretty interesting investment backdrop for us in '22 and beyond. But I'd say cautious in that market appropriately.\nAdam Beatty : One quick follow-up, do you feel the high net worth channel in Asia Pac is a good opportunity for Ares right now? Or is it still mainly institutional?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, I do.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Finian O'Shea with Wells Fargo Securities.\nFinian O'Shea : Can you touch on within the recently proposed private fund rules, the focus on adviser-led secondaries? And if the proposals on fairness opinions as described would have any impact on that market?\nMichael Arougheti : It's too early to say. And again, these are proposals, not -- there's a long way to go from proposals to actual rulemaking. The way that, that market function, I'm going to oversimplify this, those transactions are already getting validated through third-party valuations. So I don't anticipate that if that ever found its way into the market, I'm not suggesting that it will, that would meaningfully change the functioning of it or the attractiveness of the product.\nFinian O'Shea : Sure, that's helpful. And as a follow-up, sort of same topic. Do you see the growth of core private equity as absorbing some of that obvious demand for continuation vehicles? And do you think the core private equity asset class is a major competitor there?\nMichael Arougheti : It's a good question, Fin. Core private equity or longer-dated private equity has been a topic of conversation now for a decade and hasn't really emerged as a significant growth area the way that folks expected. I think some of that demand is finding its way into the secondary market. And so my own personal view is I think that the secondary market will probably capture that growth more so than core private equity\nOperator: Our next question will come from Sumeet Mody with Piper Sandler.\nSumeet Mody : Following up on the commentary around the fundraising outlook, after the record year you just experienced, can you size the aggregate fundraising potential for the 25 funds expected to be raised this year? Signing some of the larger funds to help frame out that portion of fundraising? And then maybe some color around how you think that trend extends through maybe '22 and '23 and '24.\nMichael Arougheti : So Sumeet, unfortunately, I can't do that because we don't actually talk about funds in the market, but I'll mention 2 things to think about. One, 2022 -- '21, we went into the year talking about that $41 billion record and an expectation that we would beat it. But the $77 million exceeded our expectations, so I'm not saying that they will be exceeded again. But there's a lot of momentum on the fundraising side, and there could be things that occur that are not currently in our line of sight or peripheral vision. Two, when you look at the fundraising, and we've been trying to make this clear, 2 things are happening: one, we have more strategies, so there's a broader set of funds that are available, which kind of derisks the trajectory; but as importantly, the non-commingled fundraising engine, that's a combination of the perpetual capital vehicles, CLOs, SMAs are taking a greater share. And so one way I would think about it is the floor in any given year is just significantly higher because we're going in with other non-commingled fund levers that we're pulling in the form of perpetual vehicles and open-ended funds. When you think about the trajectory of the business and the guidance that we've laid out, the good news is the bulk of '22, I think, is really less about fundraising and more about deployment and just monetizing the deployment that we saw towards the end of '21. And when you look at the significant amount of capital that's on the platform today, that's not earning fees coupled with the kind of full quarter and the annual impact of the deployment from Q4, you already have a nice glide path from a profit standpoint in 2022. So fundraising, obviously, is an important part of it. We expect to have a pretty significant year. So I don't want the message to be that we don't have a lot of fundraising momentum, but $80 billion is a lot. But the good news is the P&L development, obviously, is going to be as much a function at this point on the deployment than .\nSumeet Mody: Okay. Great. That's really helpful. And then just 1 follow-up here for maybe Jarrod, on capital allocation. I know you guys haven't been buying back stock last few quarters. Just wondering how active you're looking to get kind of around market action that we've been seeing recently? And expectation here for the share count going forward. You've seen a 15%, 20% increases year-over-year recently just something you expect to kind of manage going forward or what\u2019s the strategy there?\nJarrod Phillips: We do have a stock buyback plan in place, but I don't expect to be particularly active on that side. In terms of our share count increase, a lot of that has been a result of our recent acquisitions with multiple in the last few years, and each of those has been pretty accretive. And then I'll remind you, when we talk about stock-based compensation, we're typically targeting about 1.5% to 2% dilution per year on a gross basis, which typically ends up around 1% on a net basis. So absent acquisitions, I'd say that, that's the number you'd focus on.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.\nChristoph Kotowski: Yes. I wanted to go back to the FRPR, the fee-related performance revenues. And I guess, a 3-part question. One is in response to the earlier question, you didn't specify the asset base for both the credit and the real estate side that's subject to these kinds of incentive arrangements. And maybe that was deliberate, you're not willing to share it, but if you are, then we'd love to know that. Secondly, I was wondering if you could give the same kind of detail on the real estate side in terms of hurdle and performance rate on the real estate side that you gave us on the credit side? And then thirdly, I guess, what we're trying to get at is just some sense of what would a normalized level be? And I guess, let me define that as if you just started with the current asset base and you had, say, a 10%, let's call it, a normalized return, say, 10%-ish, what would one then expect as kind of a full year level of performance FRPR from that?\nJarrod Phillips: Sure. So I'll try and address those one at a time. In terms of the asset bases in the real estate bucket there, it is primarily our 2 non-traded REITs, so you can get a sense of that balance through the NAVs of those entities. And then for the direct lending, that's typically going to be coming from our U.S. and direct lending separately managed accounts in Perpetual Capital. So right now, those amounts are about 27% of that $77 million -- $77 billion, sorry, that we laid out in our Perpetual Capital table that you see in the earnings presentation, that's really the underlying assets that's driving that. And the next part of your question was in terms of the Black Creek hurdles, very similar base except for those hurdles are slightly lower than 5%.\nMichael Arougheti: One thing I would add, Chris, is if it wasn't clear in the prepared remarks. There's some interesting dynamics within the non-traded REIT piece of that, which is for 2021, we only captured 50% of the FRPR because we bought it in June and part of the transaction structure was to ratably share the economics with the selling shareholders. So going forward, in 2022 and beyond, 100% of the FRPR from those vehicles is for the account of Ares. Now 2021 was a very significant performance year. So you'll probably give up a little bit on performance, but you'll make that up on owning 100% versus 50 and hopefully, a growing pie. So when you look at the fundraising in those vehicles in Q4, as we articulated, that was about $3 billion of capital raised into those 2 non-traded REITs in the fourth quarter alone, so you're going to be capturing 100% versus 50% of a growing pie.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Robert Lee with KBW.\nRobert Lee : And I apologize if this was asked, parts of it were asked already, but I want to go back to capital management. So maybe, Jarrod, could you remind us, I know you just raised $500 million of very long-duration debt. So maybe just, number one, remind us on how you're thinking of the balance sheet and leverage on the balance sheet? And given the I guess I'll call it more moderate appetite for M&A, given that you have so much going on. How should we think of -- and as you have performance fees presumably accelerating in the next couple of years with the European waterfalls come through, how are you thinking about that incremental capital deployment? Is it just funding the commitments of existing funds as they've grown so much in scale or scope? Or how should we just be thinking about that going forward?\nJarrod Phillips : I think you're thinking about it right. Ultimately, we were very happy with terming out some of the line and preparing for the purchase of AMP's Infrastructure Debt business, which we just closed. And as we look forward, we really like the liquidity position we're in, and we like our current leverage levels. So really, you're right, we try and maintain that capital-light balance sheet model. That's still our intention. And really, our use of capital going forward will be opportunistically and any time that we're doing these GP stakes in our funds.\nMichael Arougheti : And Rob, I would just highlight, you've heard me say this before, but there's an interesting dynamic that's happening in our company. I don't know if it's happening at others, but the reliance on the management company balance sheet to fund GP commits on new funds is lower than it's ever been because what we're seeing is that the employees here are taking up a growing percentage of that commitment. And so the balance sheet requirement to support new fund raise is lower than it's been. Now we have more strategies, so the aggregate dollars may not be slowing, but the percentage in each fund is continuously coming down. We love that because it provides better alignment of the teams to the performance of the funds. The LPs would prefer to see that at this point. So while we'll continue to make sure that we're there to backstop those, our experience has been, most of that is getting syndicated to employees, which then gives to Jarrod's point, us the ability to use that capital much more opportunistically on new fund strategies, team liftouts and then things like that.\nRobert Lee : I'm just curious. I don't think it's something I've seen quantified, but if you had to aggregate employee investments, commitments across the platform, and I don't know it's a number you've put in the K or Q before, but what would that be in aggregate?\nMichael Arougheti : I'm going to guess, Rob, that it's well in excess of $1 billion. It's probably close to $1.5 billion and growing.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Michael Arougheti for any closing remarks.\nMichael Arougheti: Operator, we don't have any. Again, I just want to thank everybody for their continued support and for the time today. We're thrilled with where we are. It was a great year and look forward to speaking in next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our conference call for today.

            "name": "Jarrod Phillips",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss yet another great year for Ares. I'll start with a review of the fourth quarter and the full year, and then I'll provide an update on our outlook. As Mike stated, we experienced impressive growth in nearly every financial metric, including management fees, fee-related earnings, realized income, AUM, FPAUM and net accrued performance income for both the fourth quarter and the full year. In 2021, we demonstrated not only the power of our existing platform, but the ability to execute on acquisitions further adding to our competitive advantage and scope. We also began to showcase the earnings power of our perpetual capital vehicles, which contributed significantly to our fourth quarter. On that last point, I would like to highlight that our revenues in FRE now include the addition of fee-related performance revenues, or FRPR, for the fourth quarter and full year. FRPR refers to recurring performance revenues derived from perpetual capital funds that are not dependent on realizations and typically are measured and crystallized annually in the fourth quarter. This better aligns with reporting by our peers who operate funds with similar fees, including nontraded REITs and other evergreen fund structures. Starting with our revenues. Our management fee increased 44% for the fourth quarter and 38% for the full year, driven primarily by the strong deployment of our invested capital, as Mike highlighted. In addition, another $18 billion of AUM in funds raised during the year became fee pay. Our management fee stability is a key differentiator for our business model and allows us to better manage market dislocation. As of year-end, 95% of our management fees came from either perpetual capital or long-dated funds, greatly reducing the risk of redemptions even during severe market movements. With deployment accelerating means we scale our strategies, we believe that we remain very well positioned to continue this growth. Other fee income increased to approximately $22.4 million for the fourth quarter and $50 million for 2021, up 219% and 150%, respectively. This sharp increase is primarily due to the Black Creek acquisition, which in addition to management fees, FRP and realized performance income generates development, leasing and acquisition fees, which are recorded in other fee income. Our other fees also include our capital structuring and origination fees in certain of our direct lending perpetual funds. For the full year 2021, we had $137.9 million of FRPR compared to only $23 million for the full year 2020. Strong contribution from FRPR in 2021, of which about 98% came in the fourth quarter, was primarily driven by a significant ramp and strong performance in our U.S. and European direct lending perpetual managed accounts, which contributed over $85 million and the addition of 2 Black Creek nontraded REITs that collectively contributed over $48 million. Of note, since we closed the acquisition of Black Creek on July 1, 2021, we only received our proportionate share of the FRPR from the 2 nontraded REITs during our ownership in 2021, or approximately 50% of the contractual annual performance revenues. For 2022 and beyond, we would receive the full year payout of such fees. Note that our FRPR, net of related compensation, contributed $51 million to our 2021 FRE compared to only $6.8 million in 2020. Based on the nature of these funds as described, we would not expect to see meaningful FRPR until the fourth quarter of 2022. For the fourth quarter, FRE totaled $253.3 million, an increase of 85% from the fourth quarter of 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, FRE totaled $712.3 million, an increase of approximately 65% from the prior year, and it accounted for more than 80% of our realized income, up from 74% in 2020. Our FRE margin for the year ended December 31, 2021, was 39%. And for the fourth quarter, totaled 39.7%. This represents a 400 basis point increase in our full year margin as compared to the full year 2020. As expected, our realization activity picked back up in the fourth quarter, particularly within our Credit and Real Estate Groups. Our Credit Group generated $45 million in net realized performance income, which was nearly 2.5x the fourth quarter of 2020. This included performance income from our U.S. and European direct lending strategies and $10 million in net ARCC Part 2 capital gains fees. Real estate net realized performance income also increased over 2.5x fourth quarter 2020, driven by strong results in monetizations in U.S. real estate equity funds, including Black Creek's institutional funds. Overall, net realized performance income for the fourth quarter increased 49% year-over-year and full year results were up 17% versus the prior year. Realized income for the fourth quarter totaled a record $340.3 million, up over 80% from the fourth quarter of 2020 and over 60% higher than our previous record. For the full year, realized income totaled $882.9 million, a 52% increase from 2020. After-tax realized income per share of Class A common stock was $0.85 for the fourth quarter, up from $0.54 in the fourth quarter of 2020 and full year 2020 after-tax realized income of $2.57 per share of Class A stock was up 38% versus 2020. At the beginning of each year, we look to set our quarterly dividend at a fixed level for the coming year. Based on the significant outperformance of our fee-related earnings relative to our dividends and our continued strong growth prospects, we've elected to increase our quarterly dividend to $0.61 per share of Class A stock or $2.44 annually, up 30% from the $1.88 per share for 2021. This 30% growth for 2022 is ahead of the 20%-plus long-term cumulative annual growth rate guidance we gave at our Investor Day last August. We believe it is appropriate given our strong visibility from our significant dry powder for deployment, fundraising pipeline and full year accretion from our Black Creek and Landmark acquisitions. As of year-end, our AUM totaled $306 billion compared to $282 billion for the third quarter and $197 billion as of the year ended 2020, this represents a 55% increase year-over-year and our highest annual AUM growth rate as a public company. The main drivers of this increase in 2021 included $77 billion in gross new capital commitments as well as $33 billion from strategic acquisitions completed in the year. Our fee-paying AUM totaled $188 billion at year-end, an increase of approximately 9% from the third quarter and nearly 50% from year-end 2020. Our growth in fee-paying AUM was primarily driven by meaningful deployment in our global direct lending, special opportunities and alternative credit strategies, which are paid on invested capital along with $30 billion in fee-paying AUM from Landmark and Black Creek. With market volatility rising as we enter 2022, we stand ready to take advantage of any opportunities that may arise based on our record levels of available capital and AUM not yet earning fees. Our available capital increased to a new record high of $90.4 billion, an increase of over 61% year-over-year, primarily driven by fundraising in our direct lending and special opportunity strategies. In addition, we ended the year with $53 billion of AUM not yet paying fees available for future deployment. Approximately 75% of this balance is housed in our credit strategy, including over $32 billion in direct lending and $7 billion in alternative credit. Our incentive eligible AUM increased by 56% from the year-end of 2020 to $183 billion. Of this amount, $70.4 billion was uninvested at year-end. In the fourth quarter, we continued to experience appreciation in our net accrued performance income balance, which now sits at $808 million. This represents a 10% increase from the third quarter and 130% increase from the end of 2020. Of this $808 million of net accrued performance income at year-end, approximately 60% was in European-style waterfall funds. As we highlighted at our Investor Day in August, we have a substantial and growing balance of European-style waterfall funds, that accrued performance fees but pay most of their performance fees in the final years of the fund life. In 2022 and ramping up thereafter, we expect to see an increase in these realized performance fees from older vintage European style funds as they mature. As we continue to raise additional European style funds, the base of future performance income should continue to increase. In fact, we have raised an additional $20.5 billion of European waterfall style funds that were not incorporated into our forecast from Investor Day. From an organizational standpoint, we plan to reorient our reporting segments to better align with our platform expansion. Following the closing of our Infrastructure Debt acquisition, we will combine our real estate group with our newly expanded Infrastructure Debt and Equity platform. This combination will create a new real assets group reporting segment. On an as-adjusted basis, this new group would have total AUM of $53.9 billion and FPAUM of $33.4 billion at year-end, which includes our existing real estate strategies, $4.8 billion in AUM and $4.5 billion in FPAUM from infrastructure and power that currently resides in private equity and approximately $8 billion of AUM and $5 billion of FPAUM from the Infrastructure Debt platform acquisition. Before I turn the call back to Mike, let me touch on our forward outlook. As you will recall, we gave investors some longer-term guidance at our Investor Day last August. We continue to believe we are on track to reach our $500 billion plus AUM target by 2025, and our 20% or more compound annual growth in FRE, and our 20% or more compound annual growth in our dividend per share of Class A common stock through 2025. Lastly, we continue to expect to reach our goal of a 45%-plus FRE run rate margin by 2025. With significant headcount growth planned in 2022 to meet our longer-term AUM target, we expect our FRE margin expansion will moderate this year.  This was truly a momentous year for our firm with many transformative developments and record results across the board. I'll now turn the call back over to Mike for his thoughts and concluding remarks. Sure, Alex. Thanks. And it's really 2 pieces that you laid out. It's about 2/3 of what we recorded in the credit side and about 1/3 over in the real estate side on the nontraded REITs. In terms of the credit where you asked the question, that has been a growing part of our portfolio and the perpetual capital resulting from those SMAs has grown pretty significantly over the last few years, and this is the first time that this really became a material component. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, it was something that we wanted to make sure was in line with how our peers were reporting. Those are standard incentive fee type arrangements where they're earned and crystallized on an annual basis based on unrealized and interest income and realizations would be included in there, too, but it is not dependent on those realizations, like carried interest would be. And so every year, as we reach the end of the year, that's the typical time when they're going to crystallize, they'll be measured against that hurdle, which is going to be in that 6% to 8% range. We've continued to see growth in those SMAs for that product, both in U.S. and Europe. And as we continue to have a larger growth that we will hopefully see more in that line item as well. And the other thing I'd add is that these are all primarily illiquid. So these aren't liquid assets that underlie these perpetual capital vehicles, they are illiquid direct lending loans. Sure. I'd say it's always important to kind of look at the full year when you're thinking about that because realizations that happen with any -- within any given quarter are going to cause increases to the amount of taxes that we ultimately have to pay as we approach more a statutory rate of about 24%. As we look out over future years, our current cash tax experience, I think will be pretty consistent, and that has the ability, obviously, as we have more of those realizations to approach closer to that statutory rate of 24%. So you kind of look at and take that full year, I think it's about 12% is the current ratio of cash taxes paid. And then as we get more realizations, that would increase. We do have a stock buyback plan in place, but I don't expect to be particularly active on that side. In terms of our share count increase, a lot of that has been a result of our recent acquisitions with multiple in the last few years, and each of those has been pretty accretive. And then I'll remind you, when we talk about stock-based compensation, we're typically targeting about 1.5% to 2% dilution per year on a gross basis, which typically ends up around 1% on a net basis. So absent acquisitions, I'd say that, that's the number you'd focus on. Sure. So I'll try and address those one at a time. In terms of the asset bases in the real estate bucket there, it is primarily our 2 non-traded REITs, so you can get a sense of that balance through the NAVs of those entities. And then for the direct lending, that's typically going to be coming from our U.S. and direct lending separately managed accounts in Perpetual Capital. So right now, those amounts are about 27% of that $77 million -- $77 billion, sorry, that we laid out in our Perpetual Capital table that you see in the earnings presentation, that's really the underlying assets that's driving that. And the next part of your question was in terms of the Black Creek hurdles, very similar base except for those hurdles are slightly lower than 5%. I think you're thinking about it right. Ultimately, we were very happy with terming out some of the line and preparing for the purchase of AMP's Infrastructure Debt business, which we just closed. And as we look forward, we really like the liquidity position we're in, and we like our current leverage levels. So really, you're right, we try and maintain that capital-light balance sheet model. That's still our intention. And really, our use of capital going forward will be opportunistically and any time that we're doing these GP stakes in our funds."

            "name": "Michael Arougheti",
            "content": "Thank you, Carl, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope everybody is doing well. Our strong fourth quarter results capped off a transformational year here at Ares. We generated record results across nearly every key financial metric. We saw tremendous growth across our global platform and our best fund performance since we became a public company. As we outlined at our Investor Day last year, we are operating in expansive and rapidly growing end markets, and we're gaining share through our scale, product and geographic expansion and new distribution. We believe that our global platform and our unique culture of collaboration and innovation are key drivers of our firm\u2019s success. We ended the year exceeding $300 billion in AUM, 55% higher than the near $200 billion in AUM at the end of 2020. The vast majority of this AUM growth was organic and driven by a record $77 billion in gross fundraising, including $25 billion in the fourth quarter alone, well ahead of our expectations. Our strong organic growth, which we believe to be among the best in our industry over the past 3 years, reflects our investor satisfaction with our fund performance and the continued expansion of our capabilities and strategies. On top of the strong organic growth, we added $33 billion in AUM from the strategic acquisitions of Landmark Partners and Black Creek Group. These businesses are performing very well and have positioned us for significant future growth across an increasingly diversified set of strategies. We're already seeing exciting revenue and earnings synergies with Black Creek and Landmark under our ownership as we collaborate to positively impact fundraising, investing and fund performance. In addition, in December, we agreed to acquire AMP's Infrastructure Debt platform, which is one of the largest global infrastructure debt platforms with approximately $8 billion of AUM and with a strong and long-term investment track record. We were pleased to announce the closing of this transaction last night, and we're excited with the extraordinary support that we received from the Infrastructure Debt platform\u2019s existing LPs. The addition of the infra-debt team will expand our investment capabilities across the digital, utilities and transportation sectors and will enhance our existing capabilities in the renewable energy space. The growing scale and breadth of our investment capabilities were on full display as we invested more than $80 billion for the full year across more than 25 different strategies around the globe. Our deployment, record fundraising and 2 strategic acquisitions all helped drive a nearly 50% year-over-year increase in our fee paying AUM and a 65% increase in our full year fee-related earnings which accounted for more than 80% of our realized income. Our FRE margins continued to expand throughout '21, approaching 40% in the fourth quarter, an improvement of over 250 basis points year-on-year. And over the past 5 years, our FRE margins have now expanded by more than 1,200 basis points. Our prospects for continued growth across all 5 of our business groups remain bright. With $90 billion of available capital to invest and a robust fundraising pipeline, we have strong visibility for continued growth in earnings over the coming years. Given our high conviction on our outlook, we're increasing our quarterly dividend by 30%, as Carl stated. This conviction is supported by a promising long-term view on the secular growth in alternative investments as institutional, retail and insurance investors are all seeking differentiated sources of income with less market volatility. Each of these channels is expected to support the double-digit annual market growth in the alternative asset sector over the next 5 years as alternatives continue to take share from the global pool of hundreds of trillions of dollars of investment assets available. Inflation concerns and expectations for higher rates have no doubt generated some recent market volatility. In the past, we've demonstrated our ability to achieve significant growth even through volatile periods like the global financial crisis and the recent COVID pandemic. We've also effectively navigated interest rate volatility in past cycles, and we continue to believe that Ares is well positioned given the generally floating rate nature of our credit assets, the growth orientation of our private equity portfolios and the inflation protection inherent in our real asset book. We continue to see investors consolidating their manager relationships with broader platforms to gain efficiencies and strategic insight. To that point, over 80% of our direct institutional fundraising in 2021 was derived from existing investors, either reupping into one of our existing strategies, which accounted for 45% of direct institutional fundraising, or investing in other Ares strategies across our platform, which accounted for 39% of direct institutional fundraising. Today, 62% of our institutional direct AUM is from clients that are invested across our platform in 2 or more investment groups, up from 49% of our clients 5 years ago. We also continue to attract new investors onto the platform. Out of the total 427 direct institutional investors who committed to new funds in '21, 41% of them were new to Ares. Our goal is to bring new investors onto the platform, deliver a best-in-class experience and performance and then earn additional trust and wallet share in subsequent fund offerings. We saw this play out in 2021 as the average investment size for existing investors increased 35% year-over-year and was over 3x as large as the average investment size for new investors. This increasing momentum with our investors culminated in a record fourth quarter fundraising with more than $25 billion of capital raised. This included $3.7 billion for the final close of our second senior direct lending fund, SDL II, bringing total fund commitments to approximately $14 billion, including leveraged and unleveraged sleeves. We believe this single fund is one of the largest ever private funds raised in the U.S. direct lending market. We held a final close for our inaugural Climate Infrastructure Fund, ASIP, raising $1.2 billion in the quarter and bringing total commitments to $2.2 billion, including related vehicles. Investing in renewables through the energy transition remains a significant focus and a great opportunity for us in the future. We also closed on commitments for several newly launched vintages of existing funds. In our second special opportunities fund, we raised $4.9 billion in the fourth quarter and are well on our way to the hard cap of $6 billion. In our secondaries business, we raised nearly $800 million of initial commitments following the launch of our ninth Landmark Real Estate secondaries fund. And in Asia, Ares SSG raised over $800 million of initial commitments following the launch of our sixth Special Situations Fund. We also continue to experience significant fundraising momentum in our Perpetual Capital Funds with more than $5 billion raised in the fourth quarter, including $3 billion raised in the retail channel and $2 billion in the institutional open-ended channel. Our 2 nontraded REITs and the institutional open-end industrial Real Estate Fund that we acquired from Black Creek are all running well ahead of our expectations with more than $2 billion raised in Q4. So looking back over 2021, our record $77 billion of fundraising far exceeded 2020's record of $41 billion. During the year, we held final or meaningful closings on over a dozen flagship funds totaling nearly $35 billion. Interestingly, our flagship funds that held a final closing in 2021 increased their committed equity by approximately 50% in the aggregate over prior vintages, highlighting the embedded growth potential that we have from scaling existing funds. But even with an impressive year in flagship fundraising, we raised more funds outside of our flagship commingled products, including $21 billion in our perpetual capital vehicles, which now represent over 25% of total AUM. We're seeing accelerated growth across our various distribution channels, particularly in retail and insurance. While aggregate fundraising increased 86% year-over-year, fundraising in our retail channel increased over 150% year-over-year to $14.5 billion. And AUM from our retail and high net worth channel stood at more than $50 billion at year-end. Fundraising from insurance clients increased over 100% to $11.7 billion as we continue to develop products and expand our client service teams to target these investors. In the retail channel, the formation of Ares Wealth Management Solutions is enhancing our ability to drive additional flows into our existing funds and has now positioned us to launch new Perpetual Capital Funds. We are rebranding the Black Creek Funds, including the Diversified Property Fund, which is now Ares Real Estate Income Trust, or AREIT, and Black Creek industrial REIT 4, which is in the process of being rebranded as the Ares Industrial Real Estate Income Trust. Our Ares Wealth Management Solutions team is also actively working to expand product distribution with wirehouses, regional broker-dealers and RIAs in the U.S., Europe and Asia. In late '21, our insurance affiliate, Aspida, completed the acquisition of an additional insurance company, enabling Aspida to begin writing new annuity and insurance contracts, which is expected to begin late in the second quarter of this year. While there will be a ramp-up period, we expect to see stronger growth in Aspida over time as our organic sales organization will complement our reinsurance flow arrangements and potential block acquisitions. At year-end, Aspida had $3.4 billion of assets managed by Ares Insurance Solutions with more than 40% sub-advised across the Ares platform. Looking forward to 2022, we expect to have more than 25 different funds in the market, including the launch of some new fund strategies. We now have 23 commingled fund series that have closed on $1 billion or more in their latest fund vintage. This is up over 4.5x from only 5 fund series in 2016. And while we expect another strong year of fundraising in 2022, we don't expect to approach our 2021 record, particularly given the record amount of available capital that we have to invest. Our global origination footprint and increased scale is enabling us to invest in larger transactions across more geographies and across broader strategies. In addition, the private markets continue to scale which has created an opportunity to serve larger companies and sponsors as the global markets expand and evolve across the waterfront in direct lending, alternative credit, real estate credit infrastructure credit and special situations among others. So as these markets go through transformational change, we feel confident that we're gaining share and addressing investor needs with flexible solutions. For the fourth quarter, we had gross capital deployment of $32 billion, another record quarter and nearly double the $17.3 billion of gross deployment in Q4 2020. For the full year, we deployed over $80 billion in flexible capital with an emphasis on industries and assets that are cycle resilient like health care, software and technology, business services and other service industries on the corporate side, industrial and multifamily properties in real estate and renewable energy within infrastructure. Of note, we invested more than $48 billion in our U.S. and European direct lending and alternative credit strategies during the year. Our full year fund performance across every investment group was some of the strongest that we've experienced as a public company. Private equity returns in both our Ares Core of our Opportunities fund series and Special Opportunities Fund were excellent and meaningfully outperformed the broader U.S. equity market indices. Our ACOF composite generated gross returns of 7.5% in the fourth quarter and 52.6% for the full year, while Ares Special Opportunities generated gross returns of 4.5% in the quarter and 45.9% for the full year. Real estate continued its outstanding performance as the U.S. real estate equity composite generated gross returns in the fourth quarter of 10.7% and 62.3% for the full year, and our European real estate equity composite had gross returns of 5.8% in the quarter and 34.2% for the full year. In our non-traded REITs, for the full year, Black Creek Industrial REIT 4 delivered a net return of 29.7% for its Class I shares and AREIT generated a 13.8% net return for Class I shares. Our secondary strategy kept pace with strong performance across the board. The private equity secondary strategy, which reports results on a 1-quarter lag basis, generated gross returns of 13.9% for the quarter and 60% for the trailing 12-month period, while real estate secondaries generated gross returns of 18.7% for the quarter and 49.7% over the trailing 12 months on a 1-quarter lag basis. Pathfinder, which is our flagship alternative credit fund, has generated a very strong net IRR of 49% since its inception in 2020. What makes this performance particularly exciting is that 10% of the incentive fee income from this fund has been donated by the portfolio managers and by Ares to support charitable initiatives such as global poverty, health and education. Our flagship U.S. direct lending fund, Ares Capital Corporation, generated strong net returns of 4.6% in the fourth quarter and 22% for the year. Our European direct lending strategy generated gross returns of 2.5% for the quarter and 14.5% for the year. In liquid credit, our syndicated loan and high-yield bond composites generated gross returns of 6.3% and 6.9% for the year, respectively, outperforming their respective benchmarks by 15% and 29%. Our flagship global multi-asset credit strategy also generated a gross return of 12.8% for the year. And lastly, in Asia, our Special Situations Fund Composite, generated a gross return of 6.8% in the quarter and 30.2% for the full year. Hopefully, these returns illustrate that we have highly talented, motivated people driving differentiated investment outcomes for our clients across all of our strategies and highlight why we continue to enjoy a sticky and growing client base. And with that, now let me turn the call over to Jared to walk through the fourth quarter and the full year financial results. Jarrod? Thanks, Jarrod. Based on the foundation that's already been laid with our investment teams, our fundraising pipeline and our current available capital, we have good visibility that the next several years are going to be quite strong for our business. In addition, the synergies and earnings contributions from our recent acquisitions in the aggregate are running ahead of our expectations and we expect these trends to continue. That said, we will continue to invest to expand and enhance our core businesses, higher investment talent and grow our business development, Investor Relations and noninvestment support in order to maintain strong growth in the years ahead. We'll also be continuing to add to our ESG and DEI team as we continue to focus on our impact at Ares and integrate our ESG values across every aspect of our firm. We believe that this makes us a stronger more cohesive workforce, better investors and allows us to strive to make a positive impact for all of our stakeholders. As it relates to potential new acquisitions, the strategic transactions announced in 2021 filled specific product gaps in areas that we identified as high-growth opportunities. Our product breadth and scaled operations provide us a significant platform from which to build businesses organically, and as a result, the bar for new M&A is higher. We expect to be active in the organic build-out of products across each of our business lines, including optimizing the synergy opportunities in our recent acquisitions that will hopefully further enhance our growth. I want to end just by expressing how impressed by, proud of and grateful for all of the hard work and dedication of our team, how grateful I am for everything they're doing every day to deliver for our stakeholders. I'm also deeply appreciative of all of our investors' continuing support for our company, and thank you for the time today. And operator, with that, could you please open up the line for questions? Yes, it's a good question. Obviously, that's part of the core investment thesis for the acquisition is to leverage the client service organization that already exists into a broader set of relationships, both in the U.S. but also in Europe and Asia. We're far along on that. We're having productive conversations with a number of other platforms. I think the good news there is our interval fund, CADEX, which is also enjoying good growth in the channel is already on multiple platforms given our traded vehicles. We have very strong brand awareness within those channels and platforms and relationships with the adviser community. And through our high net worth sales effort, there's great familiarity with the product set up and down The Street. So we're working on it. I'm optimistic that we'll continue to make headway there. And obviously, as we add new platforms, and build it out, it should have a pretty meaningful impact on fundraising. I'd also maybe articulate for those that don't know, if you really look at the growth in the channel as important as it is to be on the wires and grow, the RIA channel is actually growing at a faster pace and represents as significant as an opportunity, and that's a place where we've already had some pretty meaningful success. Yes. It's a good question. We think that the nontraded BDC product is a really interesting product. And as you've seen us do across the platform over time is we're constantly looking for ways to grow and diversify our funding sources. It's not lost on us just what the appetite for those types of strategies are in the growing nontraded channel. So a general comment on deployment. Obviously, a driver of deployment is in our private credit strategy. So I'll make sure that we talk about that specifically. But hopefully, it's not lost on people that one of the reasons why we are driving the levels of deployment that we are is just the investments that we continue to make in expanding our global origination footprint and broadening out our capability set. So while the private credit markets continue to be a big driver of that, when you look broadly across the platform, there's a very diversified mix to where we're deploying both from an asset class and geographical perspective. And I think importantly, when you look at the mix of product, we're able to deploy and generate return regardless of the market backdrop. With regard to private credit specifically, and Kipp touched on this a little bit on the ARCC earnings call, 2021 was a very strong year of deployment. Some of that is a function of kind of call it post-COVID rebound and just some pent-up transaction demand coming out of the lockdown, and some of it was probably a little bit tax driven. I think it's too early to tell as we sit here in February as to what 2022 will hold. I'd remind people that private credit flows tend to be a little seasonal. If you look over our history, Q4 and Q2 tend to be significant deployment quarters relative to a summer slowdown and a little bit of a lull that we typically see at the beginning of the year. So it's hard to say if there's a loan now that's seasonal or as Kipp articulated on the BDC earnings call, there's just a little bit of a pause as people are price discovering given the rate backdrop. I would not though discount the power and weight of dry powder that exists in the market across the institutional, corporate and real asset equity space and what that really means for more consistent transaction volumes. You had a question with regard to -- there's 1 last question, I missed about private. Yes. So we have a very significant non-sponsored business that's geared direct to corporates and organized by industry, where we have teams that are focused on health care and life sciences lending, sports, media and entertainment lending, consumer and retail. And that's been a growing part of our deployment. When you look at it in dollar terms, it's significant, particularly relative to the peers when you look at it as percentage terms, it just can't ever really move the needle given the market position that we have in the sponsor side of the business. So we are making investments there on the corporate side. It is bearing significant fruit and I expect to see that grow. And then obviously, when you look at where growth is coming away from corporates, our infrastructure debt businesses, our real estate lending businesses, our alternative credit businesses are also a healthy mix of sponsor and non-sponsored and we're pretty active there as well. Sure. Thanks, Michael. So again, not being a needle mover, maybe that's subjective, so I'm glad you kind of asked about the quantification, but just to zoom out quickly. We have to make sure that when we're talking about private credit and direct lending that we include all of our private credit businesses, which are all in growth mode. And so when we look at private credit. Yes, there's the corporate piece that's germane to your question, but meaningful business in real estate lending, that's now in expansion mode geographically and from a product set, infrastructure, debt and obviously, with the addition of our new partners at AMP, new growth opportunity. Asian direct lending and special sits so on and so forth. So those businesses tend to be less sponsor-driven and more direct to company. So I want to make sure that as people are thinking about non-sponsored deployment that, that at least factors into the conversation. If you were to narrow the focus and just say in the core direct lending to corporates business, right now, non-sponsored flow represents about 10% of our deployment. So call it, $3 billion to $4 billion, and that has been growing year-over-year. The types of investments we're making, as I said, and I'll just restate them, software and technology, life sciences and health care, sports, media and entertainment, consumer retail, there are dedicated teams that work hand-in-hand with the sponsor groups to originate into the direct to corporate, but also to support from an industry and subject matter expertise standpoint. So it's a twofold benefit in building out those direct-to-company industry teams. I don't actually have access to the number. We could take that offline and find it for you. I don't -- and I'll ask you if there's something that you'd like to get at in terms of a view on the value of non-sponsored flow versus sponsored flow? I think our teams would generally say they're agnostic. There comes different risks and different return, whether you're making a sponsor-backed loan or a loan direct to a corporate and that always gets factored into how we price and structure those investments. There's obviously value in developing deep corporate relationships directly and surrounding those relationships with a broader product set across our entire platform. But it's not as though we go into any given year and say, the stated goal is to deploy X into sponsored and X into -- Y into non-sponsored. So if there's something that you're trying to get at in terms of some trends you're seeing or value perception of non-sponsored versus sponsored, happy to clarify. Got it. Yes. So I believe, personally, and we've been, I'd say, at the forefront of the development of the direct lending market now for almost 30 years. I don't -- I believe that cyclicality in the sponsored lending market is reducing year-over-year. That's a function of just the evolution and maturation of that market. There are more sponsors and more markets with more dry powder that are actively looking for private market solutions. And so I think you'll see volatility in that market reducing over time as the market continues to evolve and mature. I personally, based on my own experience, would say that the risk of default or maybe the risk of loss given default is higher in the non-sponsored space. And one of the big benefits of lending into the institutional equity community, whether it's for real assets or corporates is the amount of dry powder that's there could be diverted to provide credit support. And we saw that play out in spades across the entire private credit book here through 2020 and 2021 as the equity owners stepped up to support their companies in a way that non-sponsored owners sometimes can't. In terms of volume, if you look at just sheer corporate direct lending volume in the U.S., we looked at $500 billion of transaction volume in 2021 in our U.S. business. So the market is growing. It's increasing. There are more transactions, more line items. And so I don't perceive it to be as sick with coal may be as we would have told you it was 20 years ago. Yes. Thanks, Gerry. So if you go back and look at some of the things we talked about at our Investor Day, the acquisitions that we're attracted to tend to be in high-growth markets and asset classes where we have a little bit of a sense of urgency to participate in that growth, but making these acquisitions with a very high conviction that we can then organically grow them. So once these acquisitions come online here and get integrated, they become high-growth organic growth stories for us, and you can begin to see that playing out in each of our acquired businesses. So now given how active we've been, we now have lots more growth engines organically, not just in our core legacy businesses, but some of the organic businesses as well. And as financially attractive and accretive as these acquisitions have been given where we're able to buy them, obviously, we can generate very high ROEs through organic expansion. As I sit here today, I don't see any, what I would call, glaring gaps in the product set or the geographies that we play in or the distribution capability. So the types of things that we would do opportunistically would be to fill in adjacent to some of the core businesses. So places where you might see us active as we continue to build out the product set in Asia as an example, or as we continue to globalize our intra business as we integrate A&P and continue to build on the success we're having in our climate business. So there's going to be some places where you may want to do something inorganic versus organic. But I'd say the sense of urgency just given how much opportunity we have now in the portfolio is a lot less than it had been a couple of years ago.\nGerald O'Hara: That's completely fair. And Jarrod, maybe just one for you. You kind of looking over the trailing 4 quarters here, the tax rate, probably a little ebbs and flows, we'll call it. But can you just kind of remind us as to how you, all things equal, how we should think about that kind of going forward for '22 and '23? Thanks, Adam. So we have been in Asia for a dozen years. Our early intensive growth in that market were largely focused around U.S. dollar and RMB growth equity investing in China, and learn through that experience just how important it was to be broader in terms of our product set and geographic positioning, which really led us to the acquisition of SSG and the current strategy for growth there. So we are active today in the private credit markets across the region. Southeast Asia, India, a little bit in China, and to an increasing extent in Australia and New Zealand. And as you are articulating with your question, Asia is a big place with a lot of regulatory complexity, cultural complexity, market differentiation, geography by geography. And so we think it's critical to have people in local markets. That has proved to be particularly important through the pandemic. Travel restrictions in Asia have really highlighted just how critical it is to have boots on the ground in these markets that are able to deploy and asset manage actively. And I think that's been a big driver of our performance as we articulated our special sits composite in excess of 30% returns last year. We do see a growing opportunity in Australia and New Zealand. We've been investing in growth. They are actively collaborating across our platform, alternative credit, special ops and private equity are all actively collaborating with our Australia team. We are building out what I would call a more traditional corporate lending business and sponsor lending business in that part of the market just given that it is more evolved, more mature and more developed relative to other parts of the Asia region. China, we have folks on the ground in the local market. I would say, at a very high level, it's a balance. I believe strongly that we need to be there, building local relationships and capability. But given some of the capital markets and the political/regulatory risk, you have to be measured about ambitions in that market, which is kind of how we're approaching it. That said, we have a pretty meaningful advantage just in terms of the longevity of our teams in that market, some of the licenses that we have that position us for opportunity in the region in a way that others frankly can access. I personally am pretty excited about some of the volatility that we're going to see emerge in that market on the heels of Evergrande and some of the real estate challenges, particularly given the special sits positioning of our business there. My hope is that, that's going to create a pretty interesting investment backdrop for us in '22 and beyond. But I'd say cautious in that market appropriately. Yes, I do. It's too early to say. And again, these are proposals, not -- there's a long way to go from proposals to actual rulemaking. The way that, that market function, I'm going to oversimplify this, those transactions are already getting validated through third-party valuations. So I don't anticipate that if that ever found its way into the market, I'm not suggesting that it will, that would meaningfully change the functioning of it or the attractiveness of the product.\nFinian O'Shea:Sure, that's helpful. And as a follow-up, sort of same topic. Do you see the growth of core private equity as absorbing some of that obvious demand for continuation vehicles? And do you think the core private equity asset class is a major competitor there? It's a good question, Fin. Core private equity or longer-dated private equity has been a topic of conversation now for a decade and hasn't really emerged as a significant growth area the way that folks expected. I think some of that demand is finding its way into the secondary market. And so my own personal view is I think that the secondary market will probably capture that growth more so than core private equity So Sumeet, unfortunately, I can't do that because we don't actually talk about funds in the market, but I'll mention 2 things to think about. One, 2022 -- '21, we went into the year talking about that $41 billion record and an expectation that we would beat it. But the $77 million exceeded our expectations, so I'm not saying that they will be exceeded again. But there's a lot of momentum on the fundraising side, and there could be things that occur that are not currently in our line of sight or peripheral vision. Two, when you look at the fundraising, and we've been trying to make this clear, 2 things are happening: one, we have more strategies, so there's a broader set of funds that are available, which kind of derisks the trajectory; but as importantly, the non-commingled fundraising engine, that's a combination of the perpetual capital vehicles, CLOs, SMAs are taking a greater share. And so one way I would think about it is the floor in any given year is just significantly higher because we're going in with other non-commingled fund levers that we're pulling in the form of perpetual vehicles and open-ended funds. When you think about the trajectory of the business and the guidance that we've laid out, the good news is the bulk of '22, I think, is really less about fundraising and more about deployment and just monetizing the deployment that we saw towards the end of '21. And when you look at the significant amount of capital that's on the platform today, that's not earning fees coupled with the kind of full quarter and the annual impact of the deployment from Q4, you already have a nice glide path from a profit standpoint in 2022. So fundraising, obviously, is an important part of it. We expect to have a pretty significant year. So I don't want the message to be that we don't have a lot of fundraising momentum, but $80 billion is a lot. But the good news is the P&L development, obviously, is going to be as much a function at this point on the deployment than . One thing I would add, Chris, is if it wasn't clear in the prepared remarks. There's some interesting dynamics within the non-traded REIT piece of that, which is for 2021, we only captured 50% of the FRPR because we bought it in June and part of the transaction structure was to ratably share the economics with the selling shareholders. So going forward, in 2022 and beyond, 100% of the FRPR from those vehicles is for the account of Ares. Now 2021 was a very significant performance year. So you'll probably give up a little bit on performance, but you'll make that up on owning 100% versus 50 and hopefully, a growing pie. So when you look at the fundraising in those vehicles in Q4, as we articulated, that was about $3 billion of capital raised into those 2 non-traded REITs in the fourth quarter alone, so you're going to be capturing 100% versus 50% of a growing pie. And Rob, I would just highlight, you've heard me say this before, but there's an interesting dynamic that's happening in our company. I don't know if it's happening at others, but the reliance on the management company balance sheet to fund GP commits on new funds is lower than it's ever been because what we're seeing is that the employees here are taking up a growing percentage of that commitment. And so the balance sheet requirement to support new fund raise is lower than it's been. Now we have more strategies, so the aggregate dollars may not be slowing, but the percentage in each fund is continuously coming down. We love that because it provides better alignment of the teams to the performance of the funds. The LPs would prefer to see that at this point. So while we'll continue to make sure that we're there to backstop those, our experience has been, most of that is getting syndicated to employees, which then gives to Jarrod's point, us the ability to use that capital much more opportunistically on new fund strategies, team liftouts and then things like that. I'm going to guess, Rob, that it's well in excess of $1 billion. It's probably close to $1.5 billion and growing. Operator, we don't have any. Again, I just want to thank everybody for their continued support and for the time today. We're thrilled with where we are. It was a great year and look forward to speaking in next quarter."

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Wednesday, October 27, 2021. I will now turn the call over to Carl Drake, Head of Public Company Investor Relations for Ares Management.\nCarl Drake: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today for our third quarter 2021 conference call. I'm joined today by Michael Arougheti, our Chief Executive Officer; and Jarrod Phillips, our Chief Financial Officer. We also have a number of executives with us today who will be available during Q&A. Before we begin, I want to remind you that comments made during this call contain forward-looking statements and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those identified in our Risk Factors and our SEC filings. Our actual results could differ materially, and we undertake no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Please also note that past performance is not a guarantee of future results.

Please note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Ares fund. This morning, we announced that we declared our third quarter common dividend of $0.47 per share, which is consistent with our prior quarter dividend and represents an increase of 17.5% over our prior year's quarterly dividend. The dividend will be paid on December 31st, 2021, to holders of record on December 17th. Now I'll turn the call over to Michael Arougheti who will start with some quarterly financial and business highlights.\nMichael Arougheti: Great. Thank you, Carl and good afternoon everyone. I hope you're all doing well. At our recent Investor Day in August, we highlighted that our growth strategy is supported by a number of key themes. We operate in very large and growing total addressable markets with meaningful competitive advantages. Retail and institutional investors around the globe continue to increase allocations to private market alternatives, and we've expanded our product offering and distribution to meet the strong demand. In addition, we're a consolidator in our market and our recent acquisitions have provided us with new growth engines and capabilities that further enhance our potential. As you can see from our earnings report this morning, we executed well on our corporate objectives during the third quarter with strong results across the platform in fundraising, investing and fund performance. I'll start with a few third quarter highlights and a business update. We generated particularly strong Q3 growth in our AUM and management fees, both of which were up over 50% on a year-over-year basis. We raised a record $51.6 billion year-to-date, as we continue to tap into investor demand for private market solutions. We also once again demonstrated the benefits of our deep teams and broad market coverage across our investment strategies with record deployment of nearly $20 billion. Our rapid top-line growth, combined with the economies of scale that we drive through operating leverage, translated into more than 70% year-over-year FRE growth and another FRE margin record of 39%. Adding in our monetization activity, our realized income grew 36% year-over-year with a contribution from our core fee-related earnings over 90%. Strong fund performance has also led to a new record level in net accrued performance income, which more than doubled over the past year. Based on our business prospects, market position, and the secular tailwinds in our industry, we're excited about the growth prospects for our business. Let me update you on our two most recent strategic acquisitions that were both fully incorporated into our third quarter\u2019s results Landmark Partners and Black Creek Group. At our Investor Day, we outlined a playbook for building businesses that centered on leveraging the scale of and the collaboration across the Ares platform to enhance value creation, capture revenue synergies, and expand products and distribution. We're in the very early innings of executing our playbook with both of these acquisitions. And we believe that the two acquisitions collectively were already modestly financially accretive to our after-tax realized income per Class A common share during the third quarter. We expect them to be more accretive going forward as we execute on our playbook of identified strategic and financial synergies. The Landmark acquisition, which gave us a large foothold in the growing secondary market for private alternatives, is already yielding some exciting results after closing on June 2nd. In the third quarter, Landmark raised over $1 billion launched its ninth real estate fund, and is now exploring other product extensions and distribution channels. On July 1st, we closed our acquisition of the Black Creek Group, which had approximately $13.7 billion of AUM at closing and it finished the third quarter with $15 billion of AUM. As previously discussed our Black Creek acquisition is highly strategic and provides a number of important synergies across our fundraising and investing activities. Black Creek add core and core-plus real estate products, which now enable us to offer a full suite of investment products within our real estate group, including get core, core-plus, value-add and opportunistic investment strategies. Black Creek also brings a best-in-class vertically integrated skill set in industrial logistics, a fast growing segment of the real estate market. In addition to enhancing our product offerings, Black Creek also has one of the largest retail alternative investment fundraising platforms in the country. The Black Creek non-traded REITs and institutional open-ended industrial fund had a great start under Ares ownership with nearly $800 million of new equity capital raised in Q3, along with strong quarterly fund performance. A key goal for us is to expand our retail distribution onto new broker/dealer platforms over time, and to meaningfully accelerate the pace of our retail and high net worth fundraising in the years ahead. On that note, we recently announced the formation of Ares Wealth Management Solutions, which combines our high net worth fundraising capabilities with Black Creek's powerful retail distribution under one umbrella. Led by Raj Dhanda, our Global Head of Wealth Management, Ares Wealth Management Solutions will oversee the distribution of Ares investment products in the global wealth management channel. With more than 90 professionals and growing, we believe that Ares Wealth Management Solutions is one of the largest retail distribution platforms owned by any alternative manager. Our retail channel now represents nearly $50 billion in AUM, and we expect it to be among our fastest growth areas over the next five years. The efforts that we've made over the past several years to diversify and scale our products suite are driving meaningful growth in our fundraising. During the third quarter, we raised more than $20 billion in new capital for the second consecutive quarter including more than $15 billion directly from existing institutional investors. By comparison, our nearly $52 billion in funds raised year-to-date already exceeds our record of $41 billion last year. Our Q3 fundraising was broad-based across our investment groups and included a particularly sharp increase in our perpetual capital, which accounted for more than $7 billion of the third quarter total. Our perpetual capital vehicles, which include our public vehicles such as Ares Capital Corporation, Ares Commercial Real Estate, Ares Dynamic Credit Allocation Fund, our non-traded REITs, our Diversified Credit Interval Fund, our Aspida Insurance Platform, open-end commingled funds and a significant number of evergreen style strategic managed accounts were up 73% over the past year. We also raised $10 billion in long dated institutional commingled funds during the quarter. We're clearly benefiting from our strong investment performance, broad offering across a growing and diverse set of clients, and the demand for alternative investments from existing and new investors. Within our Credit Group, we raised $800 million in the quarter and we held a final close of $1.1 billion post quarter end for our second U.S. Junior Capital Direct Lending Fund, PCS II bringing total fund commitments to $5.1 billion. Benefiting from the strong performance of its predecessor fund PCS II exceeded its $4 billion target and PCS I size of $3.4 billion. In the final closing, we saw very strong participation from existing investors who contributed approximately 90% of the capital, including PCS I investors who re-upped by 140% on average, along with existing Ares investors from elsewhere on the platform who invested in the strategy for the first time. We also brought in 22 new investors to Ares. We continued to enjoy strong demand for our U.S. senior direct lending flagship fund with another $1.7 billion in equity commitments and $2.8 billion in debt commitments in the third quarter, bringing total fund capital raised to nearly $9.5 billion. We also added additional closings to our inaugural sports media and entertainment fund of about $270 million bringing total commitments to nearly $850 million. As discussed on last quarter's call, we held our first closing of $1.6 billion in our new open-end core alternative credit fund in July, which employs an asset-focused income strategy in an evergreen format. The fund is expected to reopen for new investors next year. We also launched a new open-end global multi-asset credit fund within our Liquid Credit Group, which is off to a good start with more than $350 million raised during the third and fourth quarters. In our Private Equity Group, we had a final close of approximately a $1.5 billion in ACOF VI bringing total commitments to $5.7 billion. ACOF VI is off to a strong start with nearly 50% of the funds capital already invested or committed in a diversified portfolio across its four core industries of healthcare, services and technology, consumer and retail, and industrial. We recently launched our second special opportunities fund and we just held a first close of approximately $3 billion this week. In this first close, we're excited that we'll reach three quarters of our targeted fundraise with over 45 investors and great support from existing and new investors. And our investors have given us the ability to upsize the fund. Given the capital raise in this first close, we expect our second special opportunities fund will be well in excess of the predecessor fund ACOF I of $3.5 billion. So altogether, over the past two years, the Private Equity Group has seen significant fundraising activity, with over $13 billion raised across its funds, including the second special opportunities fund commitments. In Real Estate, we held the final close for our third European value-add real estate fund EPEP III totaling \u20ac1.5 billion, which exceeded the fund's initial target of \u20ac1 billion. Including co-investments the fund raised nearly \u20ac2 billion of equity for deployment. We believe that EPEP III represents one of the largest closed-end value-add real estate funds in Europe today. The fund has already deployed \u20ac500 million of equity across six properties to-date. And finally, we raised nearly $500 million in debt and equity commitments in our two institutional open-ended real estate income funds, bringing total AUM in those two funds to a combined $4.3 billion. In strategic initiatives Aspida raised nearly $500 million of AUM in the quarter and over 60% of the new capital is sub-advised by Ares. Aspida currently has $3.2 billion of total AUM with approximately 35% sub-advised by Ares. We believe that we now have the infrastructure in place to begin scaling this platform meaningfully in the years ahead. And within Ares SSG following the final close of our Secured Lending Opportunities Fund III, which brought total fund commitments to $1.6 billion, which was nearly double the size of its predecessor fund, we launched our sixth flagship Asian Special Sits Fund and expect an initial close in the fourth quarter.  Going forward, we have a dozen commingled funds targeting a $1 billion or more size currently in the market or soon to be launched. And we have another nine institutional open-end and retail continuous offer funds in the market with $1 billion or more in AUM. When combining these fund offerings with the strong momentum in new large institutional SMAs, we expect continued strong fundraising over the next 12 months. Also as discussed at our Investor Day, we have an active pipeline of new funds in development across the platform. Turning to our deployment, as we discussed at our Investor Day, the scaling of our investment teams is meaningfully increasing investment activity and efficiency per investment professional. During the third quarter, we invested nearly $20 billion of gross capital with approximately $11 billion in our drawdown funds versus $8.1 billion in the second quarter. We were very active deploying private credit across North America, Europe, and Asia as transaction demand remains robust, particularly as larger companies increasingly tap into this market. This strong pipeline is continuing into the fourth quarter.  During the third quarter, we were also particularly active investing in some of our favorite sectors, including industrial and logistics, in real estate and a broad set of healthcare investments across our credit and private equity portfolios. We also continue to find attractive opportunities in the growing renewable energy sector, an area where we've been actively investing since 2015 with more than $3.5 billion in commitments. A great example of this is our pending acquisition of Apex Clean Energy, one of the largest developers of renewable energy in the United States. Our fund performance remains consistently strong across the platform as well. Notable highlights in the quarter include an impressive 19.4% quarterly gross return in our U.S. real estate equity fund composite, which brings 12-month performance to 60%. Our non-traded industrial REIT also generated strong gross returns of 10.5% in the quarter and more than 20% over the last 12 months. These funds are experiencing strong momentum from rent growth and supply constraints in the industrial sector. In Private Equity, special opportunities and corporate private equity had another strong third quarter up 10.7% and 5.8% with 12-month gross returns of 60% and 54% respectively. In our secondaries business, our Private Equity and Real Estate funds were up 12.9% and 11.1% respectively on a one quarter lag basis. And over the past 12 months, the funds were up 49.2% and 27.2% respectively. And within U.S. and European direct lending Ares Capital Corporation generated a 4.2% net return in the quarter and 23.1% over the past 12 months, while European direct lending increased 3.6% in the quarter and 14.6% on a 12-month basis. And now, I'll turn the call over to Jarrod for his remarks on our business positioning and our financial results. Jarrod?\nJarrod Phillips: Thanks Mike. Hello everyone. The third quarter was yet another quarter of substantial growth for us across many of our financial metrics led by very strong growth in AUM, management fees and FRE. As Mike discussed, the breadth of our platform was really on display during the third quarter as we performed for our investors across our significant funds. With a promising fundraising pipeline, continued strong fund performance, and our ability to source and find attractive investment opportunities across our groups, we remain very well-positioned for the remainder of the year and into the next. As most of you know, we hosted our first Investor Day in August and provided some long-term financial guidance. We continue to be on track with this financial guidance, including our goal of achieving our AUM target of $500 billion or more by year-end 2025, and our expected compound annual growth in our fee-related earnings and dividends per common share of 20% or better through 2025. I'll begin with a review of our AUM and fee-paying AUM as these metrics provide the foundation for the growth of our management performance fees. As of September 30th, our AUM totaled $282 billion, compared to $197 billion at the start the year and up more than 57% versus $179 billion at the end of Q3 2020. Our AUM growth for the quarter was supported by over $20 billion of capital raise as Mike described. Capital raising was primarily from flagship commingled funds and sizeable commitments from our perpetual capital vehicles. In addition to our capital raising success, the final closing of Black Creek on July 1st added approximately $13.7 billion of initial real estate AUM increasing our total real estate groups AUM to over $36 billion. Our fee-paying AUM totaled $172.7 billion at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 53% from the prior year driven by continued strong deployment in our direct lending, alternative credit and special opportunity strategies as well as continued robust capital raising. The closing of Black Creek added $9.3 billion of fee-paying AUM during the third quarter. During the third quarter, we introduced a new AUM classification, perpetual capital. To conform with some of our peers and to provide better visibility on the nature of our long lived capital. Perpetual capital is in active fund with an indefinite maturity and where there's no requirement to return capital upon realizations. It includes our publicly traded vehicles ARCC, ACRE, ARDC, CADC, our insurance capital and certain other private commingled funds and SMAs. The growth rate of our perpetual capital is noteworthy. It increased 73% year-over-year, and now totals more than $70 billion or 25% of our AUM. At quarter end, 88% of our AUM was either in perpetual capital or long-dated funds, highlighting the stability and durability of our business model. This long-term sticky capital was responsible for 94% of our third quarter management fees. Our available capital sits at a record $85.8 billion at the end of the third quarter up more than 60% year-over-year. Our available capital leaves us well-positioned with our strong pipeline and creates optionality when we see potential market dislocations. Management and other fees increased to $467 million for the third quarter, a 53% increase from prior year. For the third quarter, we reported FRE of $182.3 million, an increase of 71% over prior year. Our growth in FRE reflects both continued management fee growth driven by significant fundraising and deployment, some benefit from catch-up fees primarily within ACOF VI, as well as continued margin expansion. Our third quarter FRE margin of 39% is a new record and is approximately 400 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2020. And we remain on track to meet our 45% plus FRE margin run rate by year-end 2025. The third quarter also marks the first full quarter of management fees and FRE from our two recent strategic acquisitions of Landmark and Black Creek. These new groups have already begun to have a positive financial impact for Ares. For the third quarter, Black Creek contributed about $5 million to our FRE. We expect this to ramp up in Q4. Landmark also contributed strongly to our FRE with $21.9 million for the third quarter. We're excited for the progress we've seen in these early days for both of these acquisitions. And we expect their impact to continue to grow as we generate further revenue synergies. We ended the third quarter with $50.3 billion of AUM not yet paying fees available for future deployment, a 39% increase from the prior year. This amount translates into $488.7 million of incremental annual management fees, which is approximately 33% of our last 12 months management fees. These management fees are expected to come in at a higher margin compared to our reported margin, as this revenue growth is following expenses already incurred. For example, as we raise a new fund that pays us on invested capital, our cost to raise the capital, the cost for the distribution and IR teams, our investment teams and our business operation teams are already largely reflected in our P&L. This is a main driver of our margin expansion specifically for our more scaled strategies. Our realized income of $198.9 million was up 36% largely supported by the 71% year-over-year growth in fee-related earnings. After-tax realized income per share of Class A common stock was $0.62 per share for the third quarter, up 29% from prior year. Based on current activities, realization activity is poised to pick up in the next six months compared to third quarter levels. You can see our strong outlook for future performance income through the impressive buildup in our accrued net performance income, which totaled $731.9 million at quarter end, up 127% over the past year. On top of this, there's an additional $69 billion of uninvested incentive-eligible AUM that is not yet reflected in this amount. Overall, our incentive-eligible AUM achieved a new record of $170.5 billion at quarter end, an increase of 61% from the prior year. I want to take a minute to reiterate one of the key points we outlined at our Investor Day involving our European style funds. Over the past five years, we've been assembling a growing stake of European waterfall style funds that are building future value through deferred realized performance income across nearly all of our investing groups. The future value continues to grow as we raise additional incentive-eligible capital that is European waterfall style. For example, year-to-date through the third quarter, approximately $21 billion of the nearly $52 billion we have raised was in European style waterfall funds, including $6.7 billion in the third quarter alone. As we continue to generate strong investment performance in these funds and raise new funds, we believe we'll be able to realize significant future performance income once these funds return capital to their investors, typically in the last few years of the fund's life. This expected realized net performance income from European waterfall style funds, which is largely not present in our realized income today, is expected to become a source of steady, recurring, and growing realized net performance income beginning in 2022, 2023 and beyond. In summary, our established businesses continue to perform very well with significant dry powder and a very active deployment environment. With the completion and first full quarter of our recent strategic acquisitions under our belt, we are excited to further integrate these acquisitions and apply our playbook to use the power of our platform to extract the revenue synergies in the coming years. We have planted the seeds for additional diversification and strong growth in large end markets that we believe should position us very well for the exciting growth opportunities in our industry in the future. I'll now turn the call back over to Mike.\nMichael Arougheti: Great. Thanks, Jarrod. Our industry has been undergoing meaningful transformation and rapid growth driven by strong secular tailwinds that we believe are accelerating. Institutional and retail investors are seeking to increase portfolio allocations to a broader range of strategies across the risk return spectrum and private alternatives are a central focus. We're seeing increased democratization of alternatives with meaningfully increased retail allocations through multiple channels and we believe that Ares Wealth Management Solutions positions us to lead in this part of the market. We're also seeing industry consolidation as investors allocate greater wallet share with larger scale managers like Ares. And we believe that we're at the leading edge of this evolution and our business is well-positioned to drive long-term growth and corresponding value for all of our stakeholders. I want to end by expressing my appreciation for the hard work and dedication of our teams around the globe. The amazing growth and investment performance that we've delivered is a direct result of our employee's strong commitment to collaborate work as one team with a shared set of common values. I'm also deeply thankful to our investors for their continued support of our company and their confidence in us. And with that, just thank you all for your time today. And operator, we'd like to open up the line for questions.\nOperator: . First question will come from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlex Blostein: Hey thanks. Good afternoon, guys. So Mike, maybe just picking up on the last point you made around the Ares Wealth Management Solutions business that you've established, curious to get your thoughts about sort of what this business and what really Ares' product suite, sorry, in the Wealth Management channel going to look like two to three years from now. So we've got Black Creek on the real estate side, so that's one vertical. But how are you thinking about private credit? So outside of ARCC, what else you guys could potentially do there, secondaries, et cetera. Just trying to get a more holistic view of your vision for that part of the model?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, sure. Good question. Hey, Alex. So one thing I do want to highlight is the formation of Wealth Management Solutions is really not a revolutionary change here. What we're really doing is bringing together our already well-established private wealth and high net worth distribution with the Black Creek sales force and wholesaling capability. And by doing that, what allows us to do is just expand the product set, go broader into the wires and the Wealth Management platforms, it allows us to go deeper into the IBD and RIA channel and allows us to think about our offerings on a more global and holistic basis. So this has been in the works and you can see that, we've already had great success in terms of the fundraising in both our institutional and retail products. You're right today. The core products in the non-traded part of the market are the two Black Creek non-traded REITs, which you saw in the quarter, had great success, fundraising and performance and are accelerating. And I would expect given our brand and the resources that we're bringing to the table, but that growth will continue. We've also had very good success on the private credit side with a diversified credit interval fund and believe that we're probably one of the largest diversified credit funds in the channel as well. In terms of where the product can go, I think you should expect to see a host of new product across the platform as a lot of the big bank partners and channel partners similar to what we're seeing on the institutional side are going to shrink the number of GP relationships they have and do more with fewer brands. So what that would likely mean for us is something in the secondary space leveraging the capability set that came with the Landmark acquisition will likely have something in and around the real asset space and the infrastructure space, leveraging the capability set we have there. Given the strength of our private credit platform, I think there's an opportunity to explore various BDC structures, given the ARCC track record that we have in the traded markets and so on and so forth. So I think you'll begin to see us and others put together a product set globally that is offering a cross section of pretty much everything that we're doing across the platform that will take some time. I think we have a real head start, because it's not like you can just flip a switch and create the product, create all the licenses you need, get all the selling agreements, build the technology. So there is a lot that goes into servicing this channel, but that requires a significant amount of investment that we've already made.\nAlex Blostein: Great. All right. We'll look forward to seeing that. The second question I have for you guys, just a numbers question around Black Greek. So $800 million really strong flows in the quarter. Could you expand on maybe just the types of platforms or geographies where these flows have come in is this kind of anything particularly unique about the quarter or that's a fairly good run rate we should be thinking about. And then with respect to performance at Black Greek, to your point Michael, so really, really strong, I think in the mid to maybe high teens year-to-date. How should we think about the performance fee from Black Greek to Ares for Q4? Are you guys going to characterize it as a FRE or not similar to sort of peers? I think you only get half of it, because you only own the asset for the half year, but just want to flush that out. Thanks.\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. So I'll maybe answer the first part, which is it's pretty broad-based coming from different platforms and again, what we bring to the table together through the formation of Wealth Management is a deepening of the sales force and a deepening and broadening of the relationships with the different channels across IBD, RIA, and the wires. And so I would expect the growth to continue. We've seen it accelerate prior to our ownership and now under our ownership, given the power of our brand and the platforms, we're seeing it accelerate. The performance obviously helps. And, it's probably no secret that industrial real estate and industrial logistics is a -- in demand attractive part of the market, just given the secular trends there. So I think that's a driver, not just a performance, but also of demand. And then I'll let Jarrod to chime in here. But we're thrilled with the FRA contribution. Obviously, you can kind of look at what we acquired the platform for, and what they're delivering. And we would expect the FRE ramp to continue. Similar to a lot of our other funds, we obviously get paid as we deploy there. So as we continue to invest, we would expect to see the FRE trajectory continue. We also have lumpy fees, in terms of disposition, acquisition, development that will also start to work their way into the P&L. And then lastly, yes, in Q4, similar to a number of our peers, we would expect to see performance fees find their way into the P&L. You are correct in pointing out that being that we've only owned them for a half a year that we would get credit for half of those post-closing and consistent with the existing treatment by our peers, we would be taking that into FRE.\nJarrod Phillips: Yes, that's right, Mike. I think we don't see any real difference in those types of fees that we'll be earning ultimately than what our peers are earning at this time through the classification would be appropriate.\nOperator: The next question is from Gerry O'Hara of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nGerry O'Hara: Great, thanks. I guess picking up on Mike some of your comments as it relates to sort of exploring other product and distribution channels with respect of Landmark Partners. Clearly secondaries is one of the fastest growing areas of alternatives. But if perhaps you could give us a little extra color or context around that, I think we'd appreciate it?\nMichael Arougheti: Sure, happy to Gerry. So maybe just to quickly remind everybody Landmark is one of the pioneers of the secondaries space and have been growing quite nicely prior to the acquisition and have done a good job broadening out the product set away from what I would call traditional LP-led private equity secondaries into the GP side of the market, but also away from PE. I think that growth in Landmark in a couple of ways. One is a continuation of this expansion of the PE business towards more GP-led and structured solutions. Ares brings a very unique synergy to the table when you put these two businesses together just given the breadth of our global GP relationships and our direct investment capabilities. So as you begin to explore GP directs and things like that, our private equity capabilities and diligence capabilities, I think will be meaningfully value-add to that expansion. Two, would be to grow the business away from PE into real estate, infrastructure and credit. Landmark already has a meaningful running head start in doing that. They're a market leader in the real estate side of the business. We're in the market now with our ninth fund and have demonstrated really strong performance there, which you can see in our filings. And we recently closed our second infrastructure fund, which is also off to a great start. So continue to expand that part of the business, expand our leadership position in real assets and then probably not surprisingly, given our broad credit franchises to look for ways to leverage that into credit secondaries. Two, would be to globalize the business. Secondaries historically has not just been private equity centric and LP centric, but it's been North American centric. And given our global footprint, I think there's an opportunity for us to broaden out geography. And that's something that we'll explore. And then to your point as well would be product extension, which is to look at ways to fund the growth opportunity here, not just with your traditional commingled institutional fund, but look at a number of potential retail opportunities and partnership relationships to scale into the growth opportunity that we see. So a lot to do, already off to a strong start. We're three months into the integration. Couldn't be happier with the way that the teams are collaborating, fundraising momentum is good. Performance has been strong. And so a lot of that playbook as we said in the prepared comments while it's early is -- is we're executing well.\nGerry O'Hara: Okay. That's helpful. And then one maybe for Jarrod, perhaps a bit technical or maybe even a reminder, but can you give us a sense of the difference between the total AUM and fee-paying as it relates to Black Creek? I think I heard $15 billion as of current. And should we expect that to sort of come through over time or how does that work structurally?\nJarrod Phillips: Some of it is as a result of the fees being paid on NAV as opposed to total assets. So that's where a lot of your difference is going to be. And then there is some deployment there as well in the funds that are not the non-traded REITs.\nOperator: The next question will be from Robert Lee of KBW. Please go ahead.\nRobert Lee: Great. Good morning or good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions up. I had a question actually on insurance in Aspida so. Obviously talking a lot about the wealth platform and the asset origination fundraising I can go through that, but can you kind of bring us up to Aspida and it's relatively small, but kind of -- if I remember correctly, when you first got into that business or were targeting that acquisition, one of the attractive features was its origination capability. So kind of what's your thoughts about the ability of that platform now, or the leverage points you may have to kind of accelerate growth of the insurance business?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. So I think you have to think about it organically and inorganically. So let's put inorganic to the side for a minute, but hopefully folks recognize just given the market backdrop that there should be a number of acquisition opportunities to scale that business over time. But if you look at the organic, you then have to break it down into our reinsurance business Aspida Re and our life and annuities business as Aspida Life. And both of those have strong organic growth opportunities as well. The reinsurance part of the business is a little farther along in terms of its development having started really in earnest with the acquisition of F&G Re. As we talked about at our Investor Day today, taking on no new relationships there, we're doing about $1 billion dollars of flow business, and we would expect that to continue per annum. And then on the life and annuity side, we have all of the pieces in place, the servicing and distribution capability that you articulated Rob is in-house now. And we expect to begin ramping that organically early in 2022. And you're right prior to the acquisition that platform without our brand and products that was doing roughly $2 billion a year of organic origination. So we would expect to do that plus. So without growth beyond what we see today, and we talked about this at the Investor Day, the combination of the reinsurance business and the annuities business right now would probably have us be run rating about $3 billion per year of new origination. And we hope we can do better.\nRobert Lee: Great. And then maybe as a follow-up, I'm just kind of curious when you have -- in Asia you have Fidante in Australia, the Sumitomo relationship. I'm just wondering if there's anything you could point to or think about and how that's maybe -- point to how that's maybe helped you start to accelerate fundraising in Asia? That's the question.\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, I'm glad you pointed that out. As we talked about this, both of those, it's still early days, but we are long-term goals on the opportunity to invest and raise capital in that market. We are raising funds through the Fidante relationship and similar to what we're experiencing domestically that fundraising is scaling. In terms of the Sumitomo relationship, we're working on a number of initiatives that's been slower to develop as we would expect, but continue to believe that there's an opportunity to bring meaningful product into that market as well. So we're making good progress, Rob, but we'll kind of start talking about it more specifically when the numbers become a little bit more material.\nOperator: Next question will be from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cyprys: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Want to circle back to the capital deployment, $20 billion in the quarter. Quite an impressive number you guys put up, certainly substantial growth versus a year-ago. I was hoping you could maybe elaborate on what's changed in the business, in the industry that you're able to put up such a large level of deployment. And as you look out over the next 12 months, is this $20 billion figure here that you have in the quarter, something that could be sustained. How should we think about the path forward for deployment?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, it's a good question, Mike. I would expect that it could be, and I'd refer people to our Investor Day presentation just to look at how, not just our AUM, but our deployment has scaled over time relative to the resources that we're putting against that deployment. So not surprisingly as we're adding more people, adding more product, adding more office locations, broadening the product to attack different parts of the market. The deployment is scaling in the aggregate, but it's also scaling more efficiently, meaning we're delivering more deployment and more AUM per investment professional as we scale. So there are economies of scale. And that's also part of it. I think what we have found and we've spent a lot of time talking about this in the context, particularly of our direct lending and private credit franchises is as we get larger deployment in many respects is getting easier. And that's because you create meaningful origination advantages, ability to attract and retain people. The value of incumbency in our portfolios, where we're seeing 50% to 60% of deal flow coming from existing relationships. And as our other businesses are scaling now in real estate and for PE, et cetera, we're beginning to see that same benefit of scale in terms of the investments we can make deployment and the ability to rate larger check sizes. So I would expect it to continue. The markets are particularly conducive to good deployment here, just given the fundamental strength in the economy and liquidity in the markets. You may see one market slow and another ramp, but I don't see anything that's going to take us off this type of pace.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. And just as a follow-up question, we're seeing some firms in the industry acquire these platforms with direct origination capabilities and asset-based finance, consumer finance, and broadly just the non-sponsored marketplace in general. Just curious how you're thinking about that as an opportunity set for Ares and to what extent can it make sense for Ares to acquire these sort of asset-based and consumer finance platforms?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. So we are already doing that, and it's a good point because a lot of that opportunity really resides in and around our alternative credit insurance and opportunistic credit franchises, all of which are large addressable markets, which is also driving the deployment back to your first question. Depending on the end market will really drive whether we are investing in it as a control investor or investing in it as a non-control investor with a capital relationship. And we're doing both. So we recently announced as an example of a strategic investment into a resi business, through Aspida in order to continue to drive asset sourcing there. However, we also recently announced the growth in our net lease business in our alternative credit franchise that will be owned and controlled. So we are doing a lot of that. It resides in different parts of the business depending on what the asset class is and what we think the durability of the asset opportunities.\nOperator: Next question is from Kenneth Lee with RBC. Please go ahead.\nKenneth Lee: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just one on the perpetual capital. How do you think about the growth rate going forward and specifically the growth rate relative to the risk of AUM? Thanks.\nMichael Arougheti: I'm sorry. Ken, you broke up? Can you say that again?\nKenneth Lee: Yes, just a question around the perpetual capital. How do you think about the growth rate going forward and specifically it's relative to the rest of the AUM?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, it's been -- the good news for us is everything is growing at a high rate. Our perpetual capital has been growing probably modestly faster. And now with the Black Creek fund complex on our platform and the investments that we're making and we'll continue to make in Wealth Management Solutions, I'd expect that to continue, but it's something we laugh about over here because when the whole platform is growing at the rates that it's growing, it's tough for somebody to stand out, but the demand we're seeing in that channel is pretty significant. And when we talk about perpetual capital, as Jarrod mentioned on the call, it includes our BDC and our mortgage REIT, which had turned back on and have been raising capital again after five-plus-years of not raising capital, and includes the non-traded REITs, which as we talked about are scaling and it includes the insurance business, which is scaling as well. So it's growing faster, but the whole platform is growing. It's not as though it's going to stand out as disproportionate.\nKenneth Lee: Got you. Very helpful. And just one follow-up if I may, in regards to the potential performance income, you could see from the European waterfall style funds you mentioned seeing it potentially in that 2022 and 2023 timeframe. I wonder if you could just give us a sense of the potential trajectory of when you might see that performance income and how could you distribute it across the various businesses? Thanks.\nJarrod Phillips: Why don't I can?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, hey, Jarrod just may be contextualize what -- why we're talking about it before we get into the numbers, I think would just be helpful to reorient people to what it is and how it's going to come in.\nJarrod Phillips: Yes, sure. Go ahead, Mike.\nMichael Arougheti: Okay. So just at a high-level, hopefully, people appreciate the reason we're talking about when you're dealing with European waterfall, particularly European waterfall for credit funds, unlike an American style, where you are generating performance fees, and carry when investments are realized throughout the funds life. In a European style fund, you're effectively getting all of it at end of fund life, once the investors have gotten a full return of capital and their pref return. And so if you just think about all of these credit funds that are generating a disproportionate amount of their return through income, the minute you return investor capital and get through the hurdle that performance income just starts coming in on a regular basis quarterly. Given that you're now at end of fund life, but also just given that you don't necessarily require sales and monetization within the portfolio to drive performance income. So what we're trying to highlight is, while it will be performance income, our expectation is given the stable of funds that we've put together there, you all will begin to experience it as a much more predictable stable source of performance income, just given the nature of the underlying assets.\nJarrod Phillips: And, I think as you lookout, and we detail this in the Investor Day presentation; really we started to raise a meaningful number of these types of funds in 2017. And as Mike talked about, it's closer to the end of the life of those funds, that you start to see that recurring monetization that generally is in that six to 10-year timeframe. So when you take 2015, and you look out 2022/2023 is when they start to enter that mode where they've paid back that return to the investors, and they've reached that European waterfall level. We estimate we had about $1.5 billion of European waterfall carry related to the funds that existed -- that exists today. And that number is increased slightly based on what we'd raise this quarter and continues to increase as we raise more European waterfall style funds. But we believe that that meaningful number is really going to start in that 2020 to 2023 range, and continue to build up from there into a recurring number that is easy to see and estimate, but is not captured today in our realized income.\nOperator: The next question is from Adam Beatty of UBS. Please go ahead.\nAdam Beatty: All right. Thank you and good afternoon. Just want to follow-up on the performance fee income, and kind of the ramp you're seeing from the European waterfalls. In the past, you've said or we've suggested that as shareholders, we should sort of focus mainly on FRE that's really how you're going to pay the dividend, et cetera. And realizing come from performance fees would be used to invest and build FRE capability if you will, I guess those are my words. But just wondering, how you're thinking about the implied step-up in investment capability and what kind of opportunities you might be anticipating for the coming years?\nMichael Arougheti: If I understand the question correctly, Adam, I don't think that we anticipate given this European waterfall kind of wave that's going to start coming through the company two years from now or 18 months from now that we're going to change our capital management policy. We will continue to drive growth in FRE, paid the dividend to that growth in FRE consistent with the guidance that we've put out and use our performance income to reinvest in the fee engine. I think we're going to have to take a look when we get into that environment, where the investment opportunities are. But our expectation is that we're going to maintain our capital philosophy that we laid out many years ago. We think it's working, it's the best way for us to deliver sustainable growth over a long period of time. The reason we're highlighting it though is I think the market, my own personal view is still grappling with the difference between fee-related earnings and realizations and how to contextualize realizations with a crew performance fee, et cetera, et cetera. I think that's something the market needs to evolve. This is going to be yet another nuance in understanding that not all performance income is created equal. And that in these businesses that we run the performance income is more diversified supported by broader portfolios and supported by yield as opposed to a private equity portfolio that is requires monetization activity and is going to be lumpier. So I don't think that we're going to change the way we're thinking about balance sheet management and investing, but we'll have to cross that bridge when we get to it and see how it comes through.\nAdam Beatty: Okay. Fair enough. You got it. Thanks Mike. And then just turning, I think, I heard in the prepared, you mentioned sort of increased appetite for a larger -- from larger corporate issuers for direct lending. And I guess that's been a trend over the private credit, the history of private credit and starting with smaller issuers, but just wondering whether there was something in terms of an inflection point that's driving that. And what you're seeing in the underlying dynamics and also whether that might open up additional opportunities just by virtue of the scale of the issuer. I don't know in terms of across the capital stack or co-investor things like that. Thank you.\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. So yes, there has been a change in the market that's been a combination of folks like us accumulating enough scale to deliver these types of size solutions into the market. And it's come with what I would say maybe a comfort with an awareness of the value proposition that the private markets can deliver to a company versus the public markets around speed of execution, certainty of close, flexibility and structure, and terms, ability to scale and grow, if you're inquisitive, confidentiality, if you're public or you're doing a take private. So there are a lot of non-economic reasons why people borrow now in the private markets versus the public markets. I think Kipp has talked about this quite well over the years and on the ARCC earnings call as well. But you also have something going on in the liquid markets, which is the leveraged loan and high yield markets are moving to scale. And as they move to scale, they're freeing up kind of the lower end of their market for the private markets to take share. And the big drivers of the use in the private credit space have been private equity. So as private equity dry powder has increased and as private equity has been a disproportionate user of private credit, you're just seeing larger private equity deals getting done outside of the loan in high yield market. So there has been a shift in the market I would expect it to continue. We've historically talked a lot about these windows of opportunity that open up when the markets get volatile, when the banks are de-risking or the syndication markets were a little wobbly that we can come in with a private solution that's attractive. It feels to me. And I don't know Kipp feels different, he's on the line, that that's still an opportunity for us, but there's probably a more sustainable opportunity set for the private markets today than there was in prior cycles just given the maturation of the industry.\nKipp deVeer: Yes. I'd agree with you, Mike. It\u2019s Kipp. \nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nChris Kotowski: Yes good afternoon and thanks. Just wanted to understand your comments about the European waterfall carry, that, that amount, I'm assuming that amount is captured in the $732 million net accrued that we see on -- in Page 22. It's just that it'll come in kind of more linearly as opposed to , right.\nJarrod Phillips: We laid this out, if you go back and look at the slides in the Investor Day, that's actually not included today in that $731 million that is based on the funds that exist today, what the ultimate anticipated carried interest would be over that time in those European waterfalls, what you're referring on Page 22 is the unrealized position today. But we have the ability to look at those funds and understand the yield of the portfolio and expectations on exit. And that's where that that $1.5 billion comes from.\nChris Kotowski: Okay, all right. Got it. And then secondly kind of a modeling question. It's just, if you look at the expense level in the Operations Management Group that kind of bumped up from, it had been running in the mid-60s to low-70s and bumped up to 94. Is that a function of the acquisitions and that's a new normal now, or was there something unusually lumpy in that?\nJarrod Phillips: That's right, it is a function of a full quarter Landmark which I will remind everyone that June 1st acquisition. So this was our first full quarter with them. Then a first full quarter of Black Creek as well and just a slight increase in travel and some marketing and other items as we start to get back to normal from COVID.\nChris Kotowski: Yes, okay. But we should kind of think of this as a normal level.\nJarrod Phillips: I think that's fair.\nOperator: And this concludes the question-and-answer session. So I'll now turn the call back over to Michael Arougheti for any closing remarks.\nMichael Arougheti: No, I don't think we have any. We appreciate everybody spending time with us today. We're just really happy with where things are and the strength of the quarter and look forward to speaking to everybody again next quarter and thanks for your support.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our conference call for today.

            "content": "Thanks Mike. Hello everyone. The third quarter was yet another quarter of substantial growth for us across many of our financial metrics led by very strong growth in AUM, management fees and FRE. As Mike discussed, the breadth of our platform was really on display during the third quarter as we performed for our investors across our significant funds. With a promising fundraising pipeline, continued strong fund performance, and our ability to source and find attractive investment opportunities across our groups, we remain very well-positioned for the remainder of the year and into the next. As most of you know, we hosted our first Investor Day in August and provided some long-term financial guidance. We continue to be on track with this financial guidance, including our goal of achieving our AUM target of $500 billion or more by year-end 2025, and our expected compound annual growth in our fee-related earnings and dividends per common share of 20% or better through 2025. I'll begin with a review of our AUM and fee-paying AUM as these metrics provide the foundation for the growth of our management performance fees. As of September 30th, our AUM totaled $282 billion, compared to $197 billion at the start the year and up more than 57% versus $179 billion at the end of Q3 2020. Our AUM growth for the quarter was supported by over $20 billion of capital raise as Mike described. Capital raising was primarily from flagship commingled funds and sizeable commitments from our perpetual capital vehicles. In addition to our capital raising success, the final closing of Black Creek on July 1st added approximately $13.7 billion of initial real estate AUM increasing our total real estate groups AUM to over $36 billion. Our fee-paying AUM totaled $172.7 billion at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 53% from the prior year driven by continued strong deployment in our direct lending, alternative credit and special opportunity strategies as well as continued robust capital raising. The closing of Black Creek added $9.3 billion of fee-paying AUM during the third quarter. During the third quarter, we introduced a new AUM classification, perpetual capital. To conform with some of our peers and to provide better visibility on the nature of our long lived capital. Perpetual capital is in active fund with an indefinite maturity and where there's no requirement to return capital upon realizations. It includes our publicly traded vehicles ARCC, ACRE, ARDC, CADC, our insurance capital and certain other private commingled funds and SMAs. The growth rate of our perpetual capital is noteworthy. It increased 73% year-over-year, and now totals more than $70 billion or 25% of our AUM. At quarter end, 88% of our AUM was either in perpetual capital or long-dated funds, highlighting the stability and durability of our business model. This long-term sticky capital was responsible for 94% of our third quarter management fees. Our available capital sits at a record $85.8 billion at the end of the third quarter up more than 60% year-over-year. Our available capital leaves us well-positioned with our strong pipeline and creates optionality when we see potential market dislocations. Management and other fees increased to $467 million for the third quarter, a 53% increase from prior year. For the third quarter, we reported FRE of $182.3 million, an increase of 71% over prior year. Our growth in FRE reflects both continued management fee growth driven by significant fundraising and deployment, some benefit from catch-up fees primarily within ACOF VI, as well as continued margin expansion. Our third quarter FRE margin of 39% is a new record and is approximately 400 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2020. And we remain on track to meet our 45% plus FRE margin run rate by year-end 2025. The third quarter also marks the first full quarter of management fees and FRE from our two recent strategic acquisitions of Landmark and Black Creek. These new groups have already begun to have a positive financial impact for Ares. For the third quarter, Black Creek contributed about $5 million to our FRE. We expect this to ramp up in Q4. Landmark also contributed strongly to our FRE with $21.9 million for the third quarter. We're excited for the progress we've seen in these early days for both of these acquisitions. And we expect their impact to continue to grow as we generate further revenue synergies. We ended the third quarter with $50.3 billion of AUM not yet paying fees available for future deployment, a 39% increase from the prior year. This amount translates into $488.7 million of incremental annual management fees, which is approximately 33% of our last 12 months management fees. These management fees are expected to come in at a higher margin compared to our reported margin, as this revenue growth is following expenses already incurred. For example, as we raise a new fund that pays us on invested capital, our cost to raise the capital, the cost for the distribution and IR teams, our investment teams and our business operation teams are already largely reflected in our P&L. This is a main driver of our margin expansion specifically for our more scaled strategies. Our realized income of $198.9 million was up 36% largely supported by the 71% year-over-year growth in fee-related earnings. After-tax realized income per share of Class A common stock was $0.62 per share for the third quarter, up 29% from prior year. Based on current activities, realization activity is poised to pick up in the next six months compared to third quarter levels. You can see our strong outlook for future performance income through the impressive buildup in our accrued net performance income, which totaled $731.9 million at quarter end, up 127% over the past year. On top of this, there's an additional $69 billion of uninvested incentive-eligible AUM that is not yet reflected in this amount. Overall, our incentive-eligible AUM achieved a new record of $170.5 billion at quarter end, an increase of 61% from the prior year. I want to take a minute to reiterate one of the key points we outlined at our Investor Day involving our European style funds. Over the past five years, we've been assembling a growing stake of European waterfall style funds that are building future value through deferred realized performance income across nearly all of our investing groups. The future value continues to grow as we raise additional incentive-eligible capital that is European waterfall style. For example, year-to-date through the third quarter, approximately $21 billion of the nearly $52 billion we have raised was in European style waterfall funds, including $6.7 billion in the third quarter alone. As we continue to generate strong investment performance in these funds and raise new funds, we believe we'll be able to realize significant future performance income once these funds return capital to their investors, typically in the last few years of the fund's life. This expected realized net performance income from European waterfall style funds, which is largely not present in our realized income today, is expected to become a source of steady, recurring, and growing realized net performance income beginning in 2022, 2023 and beyond. In summary, our established businesses continue to perform very well with significant dry powder and a very active deployment environment. With the completion and first full quarter of our recent strategic acquisitions under our belt, we are excited to further integrate these acquisitions and apply our playbook to use the power of our platform to extract the revenue synergies in the coming years. We have planted the seeds for additional diversification and strong growth in large end markets that we believe should position us very well for the exciting growth opportunities in our industry in the future. I'll now turn the call back over to Mike. Yes, that's right, Mike. I think we don't see any real difference in those types of fees that we'll be earning ultimately than what our peers are earning at this time through the classification would be appropriate. Some of it is as a result of the fees being paid on NAV as opposed to total assets. So that's where a lot of your difference is going to be. And then there is some deployment there as well in the funds that are not the non-traded REITs. Why don't I can? Yes, sure. Go ahead, Mike. And, I think as you lookout, and we detail this in the Investor Day presentation; really we started to raise a meaningful number of these types of funds in 2017. And as Mike talked about, it's closer to the end of the life of those funds, that you start to see that recurring monetization that generally is in that six to 10-year timeframe. So when you take 2015, and you look out 2022/2023 is when they start to enter that mode where they've paid back that return to the investors, and they've reached that European waterfall level. We estimate we had about $1.5 billion of European waterfall carry related to the funds that existed -- that exists today. And that number is increased slightly based on what we'd raise this quarter and continues to increase as we raise more European waterfall style funds. But we believe that that meaningful number is really going to start in that 2020 to 2023 range, and continue to build up from there into a recurring number that is easy to see and estimate, but is not captured today in our realized income. We laid this out, if you go back and look at the slides in the Investor Day, that's actually not included today in that $731 million that is based on the funds that exist today, what the ultimate anticipated carried interest would be over that time in those European waterfalls, what you're referring on Page 22 is the unrealized position today. But we have the ability to look at those funds and understand the yield of the portfolio and expectations on exit. And that's where that that $1.5 billion comes from. That's right, it is a function of a full quarter Landmark which I will remind everyone that June 1st acquisition. So this was our first full quarter with them. Then a first full quarter of Black Creek as well and just a slight increase in travel and some marketing and other items as we start to get back to normal from COVID. I think that's fair."

            "name": "Michael Arougheti",
            "content": "Great. Thank you, Carl and good afternoon everyone. I hope you're all doing well. At our recent Investor Day in August, we highlighted that our growth strategy is supported by a number of key themes. We operate in very large and growing total addressable markets with meaningful competitive advantages. Retail and institutional investors around the globe continue to increase allocations to private market alternatives, and we've expanded our product offering and distribution to meet the strong demand. In addition, we're a consolidator in our market and our recent acquisitions have provided us with new growth engines and capabilities that further enhance our potential. As you can see from our earnings report this morning, we executed well on our corporate objectives during the third quarter with strong results across the platform in fundraising, investing and fund performance. I'll start with a few third quarter highlights and a business update. We generated particularly strong Q3 growth in our AUM and management fees, both of which were up over 50% on a year-over-year basis. We raised a record $51.6 billion year-to-date, as we continue to tap into investor demand for private market solutions. We also once again demonstrated the benefits of our deep teams and broad market coverage across our investment strategies with record deployment of nearly $20 billion. Our rapid top-line growth, combined with the economies of scale that we drive through operating leverage, translated into more than 70% year-over-year FRE growth and another FRE margin record of 39%. Adding in our monetization activity, our realized income grew 36% year-over-year with a contribution from our core fee-related earnings over 90%. Strong fund performance has also led to a new record level in net accrued performance income, which more than doubled over the past year. Based on our business prospects, market position, and the secular tailwinds in our industry, we're excited about the growth prospects for our business. Let me update you on our two most recent strategic acquisitions that were both fully incorporated into our third quarter\u2019s results Landmark Partners and Black Creek Group. At our Investor Day, we outlined a playbook for building businesses that centered on leveraging the scale of and the collaboration across the Ares platform to enhance value creation, capture revenue synergies, and expand products and distribution. We're in the very early innings of executing our playbook with both of these acquisitions. And we believe that the two acquisitions collectively were already modestly financially accretive to our after-tax realized income per Class A common share during the third quarter. We expect them to be more accretive going forward as we execute on our playbook of identified strategic and financial synergies. The Landmark acquisition, which gave us a large foothold in the growing secondary market for private alternatives, is already yielding some exciting results after closing on June 2nd. In the third quarter, Landmark raised over $1 billion launched its ninth real estate fund, and is now exploring other product extensions and distribution channels. On July 1st, we closed our acquisition of the Black Creek Group, which had approximately $13.7 billion of AUM at closing and it finished the third quarter with $15 billion of AUM. As previously discussed our Black Creek acquisition is highly strategic and provides a number of important synergies across our fundraising and investing activities. Black Creek add core and core-plus real estate products, which now enable us to offer a full suite of investment products within our real estate group, including get core, core-plus, value-add and opportunistic investment strategies. Black Creek also brings a best-in-class vertically integrated skill set in industrial logistics, a fast growing segment of the real estate market. In addition to enhancing our product offerings, Black Creek also has one of the largest retail alternative investment fundraising platforms in the country. The Black Creek non-traded REITs and institutional open-ended industrial fund had a great start under Ares ownership with nearly $800 million of new equity capital raised in Q3, along with strong quarterly fund performance. A key goal for us is to expand our retail distribution onto new broker/dealer platforms over time, and to meaningfully accelerate the pace of our retail and high net worth fundraising in the years ahead. On that note, we recently announced the formation of Ares Wealth Management Solutions, which combines our high net worth fundraising capabilities with Black Creek's powerful retail distribution under one umbrella. Led by Raj Dhanda, our Global Head of Wealth Management, Ares Wealth Management Solutions will oversee the distribution of Ares investment products in the global wealth management channel. With more than 90 professionals and growing, we believe that Ares Wealth Management Solutions is one of the largest retail distribution platforms owned by any alternative manager. Our retail channel now represents nearly $50 billion in AUM, and we expect it to be among our fastest growth areas over the next five years. The efforts that we've made over the past several years to diversify and scale our products suite are driving meaningful growth in our fundraising. During the third quarter, we raised more than $20 billion in new capital for the second consecutive quarter including more than $15 billion directly from existing institutional investors. By comparison, our nearly $52 billion in funds raised year-to-date already exceeds our record of $41 billion last year. Our Q3 fundraising was broad-based across our investment groups and included a particularly sharp increase in our perpetual capital, which accounted for more than $7 billion of the third quarter total. Our perpetual capital vehicles, which include our public vehicles such as Ares Capital Corporation, Ares Commercial Real Estate, Ares Dynamic Credit Allocation Fund, our non-traded REITs, our Diversified Credit Interval Fund, our Aspida Insurance Platform, open-end commingled funds and a significant number of evergreen style strategic managed accounts were up 73% over the past year. We also raised $10 billion in long dated institutional commingled funds during the quarter. We're clearly benefiting from our strong investment performance, broad offering across a growing and diverse set of clients, and the demand for alternative investments from existing and new investors. Within our Credit Group, we raised $800 million in the quarter and we held a final close of $1.1 billion post quarter end for our second U.S. Junior Capital Direct Lending Fund, PCS II bringing total fund commitments to $5.1 billion. Benefiting from the strong performance of its predecessor fund PCS II exceeded its $4 billion target and PCS I size of $3.4 billion. In the final closing, we saw very strong participation from existing investors who contributed approximately 90% of the capital, including PCS I investors who re-upped by 140% on average, along with existing Ares investors from elsewhere on the platform who invested in the strategy for the first time. We also brought in 22 new investors to Ares. We continued to enjoy strong demand for our U.S. senior direct lending flagship fund with another $1.7 billion in equity commitments and $2.8 billion in debt commitments in the third quarter, bringing total fund capital raised to nearly $9.5 billion. We also added additional closings to our inaugural sports media and entertainment fund of about $270 million bringing total commitments to nearly $850 million. As discussed on last quarter's call, we held our first closing of $1.6 billion in our new open-end core alternative credit fund in July, which employs an asset-focused income strategy in an evergreen format. The fund is expected to reopen for new investors next year. We also launched a new open-end global multi-asset credit fund within our Liquid Credit Group, which is off to a good start with more than $350 million raised during the third and fourth quarters. In our Private Equity Group, we had a final close of approximately a $1.5 billion in ACOF VI bringing total commitments to $5.7 billion. ACOF VI is off to a strong start with nearly 50% of the funds capital already invested or committed in a diversified portfolio across its four core industries of healthcare, services and technology, consumer and retail, and industrial. We recently launched our second special opportunities fund and we just held a first close of approximately $3 billion this week. In this first close, we're excited that we'll reach three quarters of our targeted fundraise with over 45 investors and great support from existing and new investors. And our investors have given us the ability to upsize the fund. Given the capital raise in this first close, we expect our second special opportunities fund will be well in excess of the predecessor fund ACOF I of $3.5 billion. So altogether, over the past two years, the Private Equity Group has seen significant fundraising activity, with over $13 billion raised across its funds, including the second special opportunities fund commitments. In Real Estate, we held the final close for our third European value-add real estate fund EPEP III totaling \u20ac1.5 billion, which exceeded the fund's initial target of \u20ac1 billion. Including co-investments the fund raised nearly \u20ac2 billion of equity for deployment. We believe that EPEP III represents one of the largest closed-end value-add real estate funds in Europe today. The fund has already deployed \u20ac500 million of equity across six properties to-date. And finally, we raised nearly $500 million in debt and equity commitments in our two institutional open-ended real estate income funds, bringing total AUM in those two funds to a combined $4.3 billion. In strategic initiatives Aspida raised nearly $500 million of AUM in the quarter and over 60% of the new capital is sub-advised by Ares. Aspida currently has $3.2 billion of total AUM with approximately 35% sub-advised by Ares. We believe that we now have the infrastructure in place to begin scaling this platform meaningfully in the years ahead. And within Ares SSG following the final close of our Secured Lending Opportunities Fund III, which brought total fund commitments to $1.6 billion, which was nearly double the size of its predecessor fund, we launched our sixth flagship Asian Special Sits Fund and expect an initial close in the fourth quarter.  Going forward, we have a dozen commingled funds targeting a $1 billion or more size currently in the market or soon to be launched. And we have another nine institutional open-end and retail continuous offer funds in the market with $1 billion or more in AUM. When combining these fund offerings with the strong momentum in new large institutional SMAs, we expect continued strong fundraising over the next 12 months. Also as discussed at our Investor Day, we have an active pipeline of new funds in development across the platform. Turning to our deployment, as we discussed at our Investor Day, the scaling of our investment teams is meaningfully increasing investment activity and efficiency per investment professional. During the third quarter, we invested nearly $20 billion of gross capital with approximately $11 billion in our drawdown funds versus $8.1 billion in the second quarter. We were very active deploying private credit across North America, Europe, and Asia as transaction demand remains robust, particularly as larger companies increasingly tap into this market. This strong pipeline is continuing into the fourth quarter.  During the third quarter, we were also particularly active investing in some of our favorite sectors, including industrial and logistics, in real estate and a broad set of healthcare investments across our credit and private equity portfolios. We also continue to find attractive opportunities in the growing renewable energy sector, an area where we've been actively investing since 2015 with more than $3.5 billion in commitments. A great example of this is our pending acquisition of Apex Clean Energy, one of the largest developers of renewable energy in the United States. Our fund performance remains consistently strong across the platform as well. Notable highlights in the quarter include an impressive 19.4% quarterly gross return in our U.S. real estate equity fund composite, which brings 12-month performance to 60%. Our non-traded industrial REIT also generated strong gross returns of 10.5% in the quarter and more than 20% over the last 12 months. These funds are experiencing strong momentum from rent growth and supply constraints in the industrial sector. In Private Equity, special opportunities and corporate private equity had another strong third quarter up 10.7% and 5.8% with 12-month gross returns of 60% and 54% respectively. In our secondaries business, our Private Equity and Real Estate funds were up 12.9% and 11.1% respectively on a one quarter lag basis. And over the past 12 months, the funds were up 49.2% and 27.2% respectively. And within U.S. and European direct lending Ares Capital Corporation generated a 4.2% net return in the quarter and 23.1% over the past 12 months, while European direct lending increased 3.6% in the quarter and 14.6% on a 12-month basis. And now, I'll turn the call over to Jarrod for his remarks on our business positioning and our financial results. Jarrod? Great. Thanks, Jarrod. Our industry has been undergoing meaningful transformation and rapid growth driven by strong secular tailwinds that we believe are accelerating. Institutional and retail investors are seeking to increase portfolio allocations to a broader range of strategies across the risk return spectrum and private alternatives are a central focus. We're seeing increased democratization of alternatives with meaningfully increased retail allocations through multiple channels and we believe that Ares Wealth Management Solutions positions us to lead in this part of the market. We're also seeing industry consolidation as investors allocate greater wallet share with larger scale managers like Ares. And we believe that we're at the leading edge of this evolution and our business is well-positioned to drive long-term growth and corresponding value for all of our stakeholders. I want to end by expressing my appreciation for the hard work and dedication of our teams around the globe. The amazing growth and investment performance that we've delivered is a direct result of our employee's strong commitment to collaborate work as one team with a shared set of common values. I'm also deeply thankful to our investors for their continued support of our company and their confidence in us. And with that, just thank you all for your time today. And operator, we'd like to open up the line for questions. Yes, sure. Good question. Hey, Alex. So one thing I do want to highlight is the formation of Wealth Management Solutions is really not a revolutionary change here. What we're really doing is bringing together our already well-established private wealth and high net worth distribution with the Black Creek sales force and wholesaling capability. And by doing that, what allows us to do is just expand the product set, go broader into the wires and the Wealth Management platforms, it allows us to go deeper into the IBD and RIA channel and allows us to think about our offerings on a more global and holistic basis. So this has been in the works and you can see that, we've already had great success in terms of the fundraising in both our institutional and retail products. You're right today. The core products in the non-traded part of the market are the two Black Creek non-traded REITs, which you saw in the quarter, had great success, fundraising and performance and are accelerating. And I would expect given our brand and the resources that we're bringing to the table, but that growth will continue. We've also had very good success on the private credit side with a diversified credit interval fund and believe that we're probably one of the largest diversified credit funds in the channel as well. In terms of where the product can go, I think you should expect to see a host of new product across the platform as a lot of the big bank partners and channel partners similar to what we're seeing on the institutional side are going to shrink the number of GP relationships they have and do more with fewer brands. So what that would likely mean for us is something in the secondary space leveraging the capability set that came with the Landmark acquisition will likely have something in and around the real asset space and the infrastructure space, leveraging the capability set we have there. Given the strength of our private credit platform, I think there's an opportunity to explore various BDC structures, given the ARCC track record that we have in the traded markets and so on and so forth. So I think you'll begin to see us and others put together a product set globally that is offering a cross section of pretty much everything that we're doing across the platform that will take some time. I think we have a real head start, because it's not like you can just flip a switch and create the product, create all the licenses you need, get all the selling agreements, build the technology. So there is a lot that goes into servicing this channel, but that requires a significant amount of investment that we've already made. Sure. So I'll maybe answer the first part, which is it's pretty broad-based coming from different platforms and again, what we bring to the table together through the formation of Wealth Management is a deepening of the sales force and a deepening and broadening of the relationships with the different channels across IBD, RIA, and the wires. And so I would expect the growth to continue. We've seen it accelerate prior to our ownership and now under our ownership, given the power of our brand and the platforms, we're seeing it accelerate. The performance obviously helps. And, it's probably no secret that industrial real estate and industrial logistics is a -- in demand attractive part of the market, just given the secular trends there. So I think that's a driver, not just a performance, but also of demand. And then I'll let Jarrod to chime in here. But we're thrilled with the FRA contribution. Obviously, you can kind of look at what we acquired the platform for, and what they're delivering. And we would expect the FRE ramp to continue. Similar to a lot of our other funds, we obviously get paid as we deploy there. So as we continue to invest, we would expect to see the FRE trajectory continue. We also have lumpy fees, in terms of disposition, acquisition, development that will also start to work their way into the P&L. And then lastly, yes, in Q4, similar to a number of our peers, we would expect to see performance fees find their way into the P&L. You are correct in pointing out that being that we've only owned them for a half a year that we would get credit for half of those post-closing and consistent with the existing treatment by our peers, we would be taking that into FRE. Sure, happy to Gerry. So maybe just to quickly remind everybody Landmark is one of the pioneers of the secondaries space and have been growing quite nicely prior to the acquisition and have done a good job broadening out the product set away from what I would call traditional LP-led private equity secondaries into the GP side of the market, but also away from PE. I think that growth in Landmark in a couple of ways. One is a continuation of this expansion of the PE business towards more GP-led and structured solutions. Ares brings a very unique synergy to the table when you put these two businesses together just given the breadth of our global GP relationships and our direct investment capabilities. So as you begin to explore GP directs and things like that, our private equity capabilities and diligence capabilities, I think will be meaningfully value-add to that expansion. Two, would be to grow the business away from PE into real estate, infrastructure and credit. Landmark already has a meaningful running head start in doing that. They're a market leader in the real estate side of the business. We're in the market now with our ninth fund and have demonstrated really strong performance there, which you can see in our filings. And we recently closed our second infrastructure fund, which is also off to a great start. So continue to expand that part of the business, expand our leadership position in real assets and then probably not surprisingly, given our broad credit franchises to look for ways to leverage that into credit secondaries. Two, would be to globalize the business. Secondaries historically has not just been private equity centric and LP centric, but it's been North American centric. And given our global footprint, I think there's an opportunity for us to broaden out geography. And that's something that we'll explore. And then to your point as well would be product extension, which is to look at ways to fund the growth opportunity here, not just with your traditional commingled institutional fund, but look at a number of potential retail opportunities and partnership relationships to scale into the growth opportunity that we see. So a lot to do, already off to a strong start. We're three months into the integration. Couldn't be happier with the way that the teams are collaborating, fundraising momentum is good. Performance has been strong. And so a lot of that playbook as we said in the prepared comments while it's early is -- is we're executing well.\nGerry O'Hara: Okay. That's helpful. And then one maybe for Jarrod, perhaps a bit technical or maybe even a reminder, but can you give us a sense of the difference between the total AUM and fee-paying as it relates to Black Creek? I think I heard $15 billion as of current. And should we expect that to sort of come through over time or how does that work structurally? Yes. So I think you have to think about it organically and inorganically. So let's put inorganic to the side for a minute, but hopefully folks recognize just given the market backdrop that there should be a number of acquisition opportunities to scale that business over time. But if you look at the organic, you then have to break it down into our reinsurance business Aspida Re and our life and annuities business as Aspida Life. And both of those have strong organic growth opportunities as well. The reinsurance part of the business is a little farther along in terms of its development having started really in earnest with the acquisition of F&G Re. As we talked about at our Investor Day today, taking on no new relationships there, we're doing about $1 billion dollars of flow business, and we would expect that to continue per annum. And then on the life and annuity side, we have all of the pieces in place, the servicing and distribution capability that you articulated Rob is in-house now. And we expect to begin ramping that organically early in 2022. And you're right prior to the acquisition that platform without our brand and products that was doing roughly $2 billion a year of organic origination. So we would expect to do that plus. So without growth beyond what we see today, and we talked about this at the Investor Day, the combination of the reinsurance business and the annuities business right now would probably have us be run rating about $3 billion per year of new origination. And we hope we can do better. Yes, I'm glad you pointed that out. As we talked about this, both of those, it's still early days, but we are long-term goals on the opportunity to invest and raise capital in that market. We are raising funds through the Fidante relationship and similar to what we're experiencing domestically that fundraising is scaling. In terms of the Sumitomo relationship, we're working on a number of initiatives that's been slower to develop as we would expect, but continue to believe that there's an opportunity to bring meaningful product into that market as well. So we're making good progress, Rob, but we'll kind of start talking about it more specifically when the numbers become a little bit more material. Yes, it's a good question, Mike. I would expect that it could be, and I'd refer people to our Investor Day presentation just to look at how, not just our AUM, but our deployment has scaled over time relative to the resources that we're putting against that deployment. So not surprisingly as we're adding more people, adding more product, adding more office locations, broadening the product to attack different parts of the market. The deployment is scaling in the aggregate, but it's also scaling more efficiently, meaning we're delivering more deployment and more AUM per investment professional as we scale. So there are economies of scale. And that's also part of it. I think what we have found and we've spent a lot of time talking about this in the context, particularly of our direct lending and private credit franchises is as we get larger deployment in many respects is getting easier. And that's because you create meaningful origination advantages, ability to attract and retain people. The value of incumbency in our portfolios, where we're seeing 50% to 60% of deal flow coming from existing relationships. And as our other businesses are scaling now in real estate and for PE, et cetera, we're beginning to see that same benefit of scale in terms of the investments we can make deployment and the ability to rate larger check sizes. So I would expect it to continue. The markets are particularly conducive to good deployment here, just given the fundamental strength in the economy and liquidity in the markets. You may see one market slow and another ramp, but I don't see anything that's going to take us off this type of pace. Yes. So we are already doing that, and it's a good point because a lot of that opportunity really resides in and around our alternative credit insurance and opportunistic credit franchises, all of which are large addressable markets, which is also driving the deployment back to your first question. Depending on the end market will really drive whether we are investing in it as a control investor or investing in it as a non-control investor with a capital relationship. And we're doing both. So we recently announced as an example of a strategic investment into a resi business, through Aspida in order to continue to drive asset sourcing there. However, we also recently announced the growth in our net lease business in our alternative credit franchise that will be owned and controlled. So we are doing a lot of that. It resides in different parts of the business depending on what the asset class is and what we think the durability of the asset opportunities. I'm sorry. Ken, you broke up? Can you say that again? Yes, it's been -- the good news for us is everything is growing at a high rate. Our perpetual capital has been growing probably modestly faster. And now with the Black Creek fund complex on our platform and the investments that we're making and we'll continue to make in Wealth Management Solutions, I'd expect that to continue, but it's something we laugh about over here because when the whole platform is growing at the rates that it's growing, it's tough for somebody to stand out, but the demand we're seeing in that channel is pretty significant. And when we talk about perpetual capital, as Jarrod mentioned on the call, it includes our BDC and our mortgage REIT, which had turned back on and have been raising capital again after five-plus-years of not raising capital, and includes the non-traded REITs, which as we talked about are scaling and it includes the insurance business, which is scaling as well. So it's growing faster, but the whole platform is growing. It's not as though it's going to stand out as disproportionate. Yes, hey, Jarrod just may be contextualize what -- why we're talking about it before we get into the numbers, I think would just be helpful to reorient people to what it is and how it's going to come in. Okay. So just at a high-level, hopefully, people appreciate the reason we're talking about when you're dealing with European waterfall, particularly European waterfall for credit funds, unlike an American style, where you are generating performance fees, and carry when investments are realized throughout the funds life. In a European style fund, you're effectively getting all of it at end of fund life, once the investors have gotten a full return of capital and their pref return. And so if you just think about all of these credit funds that are generating a disproportionate amount of their return through income, the minute you return investor capital and get through the hurdle that performance income just starts coming in on a regular basis quarterly. Given that you're now at end of fund life, but also just given that you don't necessarily require sales and monetization within the portfolio to drive performance income. So what we're trying to highlight is, while it will be performance income, our expectation is given the stable of funds that we've put together there, you all will begin to experience it as a much more predictable stable source of performance income, just given the nature of the underlying assets. If I understand the question correctly, Adam, I don't think that we anticipate given this European waterfall kind of wave that's going to start coming through the company two years from now or 18 months from now that we're going to change our capital management policy. We will continue to drive growth in FRE, paid the dividend to that growth in FRE consistent with the guidance that we've put out and use our performance income to reinvest in the fee engine. I think we're going to have to take a look when we get into that environment, where the investment opportunities are. But our expectation is that we're going to maintain our capital philosophy that we laid out many years ago. We think it's working, it's the best way for us to deliver sustainable growth over a long period of time. The reason we're highlighting it though is I think the market, my own personal view is still grappling with the difference between fee-related earnings and realizations and how to contextualize realizations with a crew performance fee, et cetera, et cetera. I think that's something the market needs to evolve. This is going to be yet another nuance in understanding that not all performance income is created equal. And that in these businesses that we run the performance income is more diversified supported by broader portfolios and supported by yield as opposed to a private equity portfolio that is requires monetization activity and is going to be lumpier. So I don't think that we're going to change the way we're thinking about balance sheet management and investing, but we'll have to cross that bridge when we get to it and see how it comes through. Sure. So yes, there has been a change in the market that's been a combination of folks like us accumulating enough scale to deliver these types of size solutions into the market. And it's come with what I would say maybe a comfort with an awareness of the value proposition that the private markets can deliver to a company versus the public markets around speed of execution, certainty of close, flexibility and structure, and terms, ability to scale and grow, if you're inquisitive, confidentiality, if you're public or you're doing a take private. So there are a lot of non-economic reasons why people borrow now in the private markets versus the public markets. I think Kipp has talked about this quite well over the years and on the ARCC earnings call as well. But you also have something going on in the liquid markets, which is the leveraged loan and high yield markets are moving to scale. And as they move to scale, they're freeing up kind of the lower end of their market for the private markets to take share. And the big drivers of the use in the private credit space have been private equity. So as private equity dry powder has increased and as private equity has been a disproportionate user of private credit, you're just seeing larger private equity deals getting done outside of the loan in high yield market. So there has been a shift in the market I would expect it to continue. We've historically talked a lot about these windows of opportunity that open up when the markets get volatile, when the banks are de-risking or the syndication markets were a little wobbly that we can come in with a private solution that's attractive. It feels to me. And I don't know Kipp feels different, he's on the line, that that's still an opportunity for us, but there's probably a more sustainable opportunity set for the private markets today than there was in prior cycles just given the maturation of the industry. No, I don't think we have any. We appreciate everybody spending time with us today. We're just really happy with where things are and the strength of the quarter and look forward to speaking to everybody again next quarter and thanks for your support."

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, July 29, 2021. I will now turn the call over to Carl Drake, Head of Public Company Investor Relations for Ares Management.\nCarl Drake: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today for our second quarter 2021 conference call. I'm joined today by Michael Arougheti, our Chief Executive Officer; and Michael McFerran, our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. We also have a number of executives with us today that will be available during Q&A. Before we begin, I want to remind you that comments made during this call contain forward-looking statements and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those identified in our risk factors and our SEC filings. Our actual results could differ materially, and we undertake no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Please also note that past performance is not a guarantee of future results. During this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Please refer to our second quarter earnings presentation available on the Investor Resources section of our website for reconciliations of the measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Please note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Ares fund. This morning, we announced that we declared our third quarter common dividend of $0.47 per share, which is consistent with our prior quarter dividend and represents an increase of 17.5% over our prior year's quarterly dividend. The dividend will be paid on September 30, 2021, to holders of record on September 16. Note that we redeemed our outstanding Series A preferred stock on June 30, 2021, and we also paid our last dividend on the same day. Now I'll turn the call over to Michael Arougheti, who will start with some quarterly financial and business highlights.\nMichael Arougheti: Great. Thanks, Carl, and good afternoon, everybody. I hope you are doing well. As our second quarter's results demonstrate, we continue to hit on all cylinders in our core business with a record quarter of fundraising, AUM metrics, management fees, fee-related earnings, FRE margin and realized income. During the second quarter, our top line management fees increased 34%, our FRE increased by 52% and our realized income grew 80%, all on a year-over-year basis. Our fee-related earnings increased sequentially for the 17th consecutive quarter, which we believe speaks to the stability and consistency behind the growth trajectory of our management fee-centric business model. We raised more than $20 billion in new capital across the platform, which puts us at more than $30 billion raised for the first half of the year. This compares to our record full year fundraising of $41 billion last year. Our quarterly fund performance was also the strongest quarter of fund appreciation in our firm's history. The second half of 2021 and beyond looks promising for us as our transaction and fundraising pipelines both remain elevated, and we believe that the market environment remains conducive for additional realization activity. We've also added several new growth engines to the platform, which strengthens our confidence in our ability to drive continued shareholder value and long-term growth of 20% or more in our FRE and dividends in the coming years. During the second quarter, we executed on our strategic vision to scale and expand our product suite, closing our previously announced acquisition of Landmark Partners on June two and creating our new secondary solutions group. We believe that the secondaries industry is at an inflection point, and the combination of Landmark's industry leadership and our global sponsor and investor relationships will provide us with meaningful growth opportunities. We're focused on integrating this business and capitalizing on a range of revenue synergies and potential product expansions. Just after quarter end, we meaningfully scaled our Real Estate Group by closing on our acquisition of Black Creek Group, which had approximately $13.7 billion of AUM as of June 30. Black Creek is a vertically integrated real estate manager, predominantly offering core and core-plus strategies with a long and successful track record. Adding a premier core/core-plus manager fills a product gap for us within our real estate product offering, and we can now offer a complete suite across the risk-return spectrum to our real estate investors. The company is also one of the three largest industrial real estate investors in the U.S., which is Ares' highest-conviction global real estate sector and one with favorable long-term demand drivers.  Black Creek's 100 investment professionals with locations across the U.S. will also meaningfully enhance our scale and visibility on transactions and market coverage. Importantly, Black Creek also operates one of the top non-traded REIT fundraising platforms in the country, which we believe, offers tremendous upside as we use our relationships to expand through global wealth platforms and add new retail-oriented products across all of our business lines. We're very excited about the opportunities for these growth engines as we leverage the power of our platform to enhance investor distribution and eventually expand our products into new business opportunities. With these highly attractive and financially accretive acquisitions in place, we are intensely focused on recognizing the many revenue synergy opportunities in front of us, which we expect will enhance our earnings growth in future years. We also continue to progress with our insurance initiative. With Aspida's recently closed Global Bankers Insurance Group transaction, we added the marketing, technology and infrastructure that will provide the foundation for underwriting new life insurance and annuity products, which we expect to begin next year. We also continue to add new flow reinsurance contracts, and we're seeing a growing number of sub-advisory management services for Aspida's portfolio across the firm. On the investor front, we continue to benefit from the strong secular tailwinds driving the demand for alternative private assets and investor thirst for durable yield. As we scale, more investors are coming on to our platform and then allocating additional funds to us. Investors are finding that we can provide solutions to meet their desire for consistent and attractive risk-adjusted investment returns throughout market cycles. Following our strong first quarter with $10.6 billion raised, we raised more than $20 billion in organic capital during the second quarter, with over 80% of the direct institutional capital coming from existing investors. We saw contributions across all of our investment groups with large closings in U.S. and European direct lending, liquid and alternative credit, real estate, private equity, including climate infrastructure, secondary solutions and Asian secured lending. A perfect example of the strong demand that we're seeing is through our first closing of $5.1 billion for our second U.S. senior direct lending fund, which is already in excess of its $4.5 billion target and 70% larger than our predecessor fund size. On this first close, we had very strong participation from existing investors, with 43 out of the total 54 investors as existing Ares clients. Interestingly, our two largest investors in the first close are longtime Ares investors, making their first commitment to U.S. direct lending. We also saw significant support from the predecessor fund investors with over 20 committing and upsizing by 20% on average. Based on anticipated fund leverage, the total fund capital after the first close is expected to be more than $8.5 billion, and we're continuing our fundraising efforts and expect the final size to grow from there. Also, within credit, we followed up with another meaningful close of $1.7 billion for our second U.S. junior capital direct lending fund, bringing total commitments to $3.6 billion, also already ahead of our last fund. We continue to fundraise and expect to exceed our $4 billion target in the near future. During the second quarter, and as we previously announced, we also held our final close for ACE V, which added another \u20ac1.5 billion in LP commitments. And by adding in a modest debt facility, ACE V is now over \u20ac13 billion or $15.6 billion in size. ACE V is off to an excellent start with more than 20% of the fund already committed with new investments. Our strong and consistent performance within our Real Estate Group and our ability to source and manage off-market assets is translating into significant momentum in our real estate fundraising as well. We held the first close of more than $600 million for our tenth U.S. value-add real estate fund, which is nearly halfway to our target. And we added more than \u20ac600 million in our third European value-add fund, including related co-investments. We expect both funds to meet or exceed their targets as well. We also held the final closing of SLO III, Ares SSG's third flagship fund and secure direct lending. SLO III closed on $1.6 billion in commitments, which was approximately double the size of the successor fund \u2013 predecessor fund, SLO II, and above our target of $1.5 billion. Ares SSG continues to see very strong demand for its products due to its differentiated pan-Asian private markets footprint. We're seeing strong momentum in capital raising through certain perpetual life open-ended vehicles. During the second quarter, Black Creek raised over $600 million of equity and additional $700 million of debt in its non-traded REIT platform. And just after quarter end, we held a $1.6 billion first close on our new open-end core alternative credit fund. This complementary fund, Pathfinder, is also managed by our alternative credit team where they focus on a broad range of core investments backed by assets with contractual cash flows. Going forward, we continue to focus on launching more perpetual life and open-ended capital vehicles. Looking forward, we have a strong pipeline of funds in the market across all of our businesses, and we expect 2021 will exceed our 2020 record of $41 billion. In terms of larger flagship funds, we expect additional closings in our sixth corporate private equity fund, our second special opportunities fund, our inaugural climate infrastructure fund, our sixth Asian Special Sits Fund, our two aforementioned U.S. flagship direct lending funds, our U.S. and European real estate funds, our 17th private equity fund \u2013 secondaries fund, our 9th real estate secondaries fund and our inaugural sports, media and entertainment fund, just to name several. We also have several new strategies that we plan to launch over the next 12 months. Our broader platform has clearly set us up for a deeper and more diverse fundraising pipeline as investor appetite for our private market alternatives is increasing. The investing environment is very attractive, reflecting improving confidence on the part of businesses and investors. In that context, we had a strong deployment quarter with over $10 billion invested, with $8.1 billion in our drawdown funds versus $4.7 billion for the same period last year, an increase of 72%. Our ability to continue to find attractive deployment opportunities across our businesses illustrates the breadth of our extensive sourcing platform, our incumbency advantages across our funds, almost 3,000 portfolio companies and the meaningful competitive advantages that we've created with scale and flexible capital. In addition, we're seeing more companies and sponsors wanting to partner with us after seeing how many traditional sources of capital were less reliable during the pandemic. Many of our investment teams are seeing record levels of activity with strong future pipelines, while at the same time, taking advantage of our significant incumbent relationships to provide capital in situations where many of these transactions never come to the market for competition. And lastly, I'll touch on investment performance. As you can see throughout our earnings presentation, we had another very strong quarter of fund performance across our strategies, including quarterly gross returns in both our corporate private equity and our special opportunity strategies of 15% and U.S. equity real estate returns of more than 14% for the quarter. In our private equity group, corporate private equity and special opportunities achieved gross returns over the last 12 months of 55% and 58%, respectively. Of note, the group's largest fund, ACOF V, fully crossed into the carry during this time, with its since-inception IRR in the mid-teens as of quarter end. We also saw strong direct lending returns, with Ares Capital generating net returns of over 6% for the second quarter and more than 26% over the last 12 months, meaningfully outperforming the high-yield indices. And our liquid credit loan and high-yield composites also continued to outperform the relative benchmarks for the first half of the year. Overall, our strong fund performance more than doubled our accrued net performance income as Mike will touch on in a moment. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Mike McFerran for his remarks on our business positioning and our financial results. Mike?\nMike McFerran: Thanks Mike. Hello, everyone. I hope everyone remains safe and well. As Mike mentioned, the second quarter not only represented our 17th consecutive quarter of sequential FRE growth, but our record financial results and capital raising, robust deployment and strong fund performance collectively continue to reflect the continued growth and durability of our uniquely differentiated and diversified business. I\u2019ll start my comments with a review of AUM and fee-paying AUM before turning to our quarterly results as these metrics provide the foundation of our current and future management of performance fees. As of June 30, our AUM totaled $247.9 billion compared to $197 billion at year-end and up more than 56% versus $158.4 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2020. Our AUM growth for the quarter was driven by over $20 billion of capital raise that Mike described and the closing of our acquisition of Landmark Partners in June, which added approximately $19.5 billion of AUM. With over $30 billion of capital raised in the first half of the year, we are well on our way to exceeding the record $41 billion that we raised in 2020. Our fee-paying AUM totaled $153.7 billion at the end of the second quarter, an increase of 46% from prior year, driven by continued strong deployment in our direct lending, alternative credit and special opportunity strategies as well as continued strong fundraising. The closing of Landmark Partners added $16.8 billion of fee-paying AUM during the quarter. Our available capital sits at $76 billion at the end of the second quarter, having a new record high for the firm and up nearly 100% year-over-year. This balance represents a significant competitive advantage for deployment as markets continue to open up further across sectors. Next, I will turn to our earnings for the quarter. For the second quarter, we reported FRE of $146.9 million, an increase of 52% over prior year. Our growth in FRE reflects both continued management fee growth and continued margin expansion. Management and other fees increased to $380.1 million for the second quarter, a 35% increase from prior year. Our second quarter FRE margin of 39% is a new record and is 425 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2020. As you see in our earnings presentation, we ended the second quarter with $42.6 billion of AUM not yet paying fees available for future deployment, a 70% increase from prior year. The $42.6 billion translates into $400.9 million of incremental annual management fees, which is approximately 30% of our last 12 months\u2019 management fees. These management fees will come online at a higher margin than our currently reported margin as this revenue growth is following expenses that have already been incurred. For example, as we raise a new fund that pays us on invested capital, our cost to raise the capital, the cost for distribution and our IR teams, our investment teams and our business operation teams were already largely reflected in our P&L. This trend is not new and is why you witnessed continued a more recently accelerating margin expansion. In addition to strong FRE growth, we experienced even higher realized income growth, with realized income for the second quarter totaling $206.9 million, an 80% increase over prior year that was driven through a combination of the over 50% year-over-year FRE growth that I already referenced and an increase of more than 300% and net realized performance income from the prior year period. After-tax realized income per share of Class A common stock, net of preferred stock distributions, was $0.64 per share for the second quarter, up 64% from prior year. We are in a period that provides a strong market backdrop for realizations. And our model is diversified, where we have the opportunity to realize performance income from realizations to the full or partial exit of positions and strategies like private equity and real estate. And our credit business enables us to earn performance income more consistently over the typical life cycle of those funds. The second quarter reflects this as all businesses contributed to our performance income for the quarter, with two-thirds of that income coming from our credit business. We expect this trend to continue, especially as we get into the later part of 2022 and to early 2023 as many of our flagship credit funds are expected to be generating distributions from their European waterfall structures. Sitting here today, we believe the outlook for performance income generation is strong, as demonstrated through our record level of accrued net performance income balance of $615.6 million at quarter end, an increase of over 110% from a year ago. In addition, incentive-eligible AUM also achieved a new record of $151.3 billion at quarter end, a 65% increase from prior year. Approximately 58% of our incentive-eligible AUM is currently invested at quarter end, with 72% of that already incentive generating. I do want to highlight that if you exclude ARCC\u2019s Part II incentive-generating AUM, which we have discussed before, has been episodic and are generating incentives on a recurring basis, approximately 90% of our deployed incentive-eligible AUM is currently incentive-generating. As Mike stated, included in incentive-generating AUM at quarter end was our fifth corporate private equity fund that crossed into carry generation in the second quarter and a strong performance pushed the fund fully through the GPLP catch-up and into full carry mode. We were also very active in the capital markets in the second quarter. In early April, we completed a public equity offering and a concurrent private placement, which raised $828 million. In late June, we took advantage of an attractive rate environment to issue $450 million of 4.18% 30-year fixed rate resettable subordinated notes. And lastly, on June 30, we redeemed our previously outstanding $310 million of Series A 7% preferred stock issuance. Our equity and debt issuances strengthen our liquidity position, which supported the acquisition of Landmark Partners in June and our acquisition of Black Creek just after quarter-end on July 1. Pro forma for these transactions, we remain in a strong liquidity position with low net leverage, and I\u2019m confident that we wouldn\u2019t realistically consider returning to the equity markets for capital in the foreseeable future. Most importantly, we believe that with the capital market activities and the acquisitions we made this quarter are meaningfully accretive to our earnings and dividend going forward. As many of you know, in conjunction with the Black Creek announcement, we upped our long-term financial guidance on FRE growth from 15%-plus to 20%-plus, inclusive of these two transactions. And we included a target of 20%-plus growth rate in our dividends per common share. This guidance illustrates the confidence we have both in our core business and the growth opportunity with these two strategic transactions. With that, I\u2019m going to hand this back over to Mike.\nMichael Arougheti: Great. Thanks, Mike. As we\u2019ve talked in the past, our industry has been undergoing meaningful transformation and rapid growth, and it\u2019s being driven by secular changes that we believe are accelerating. Institutional investors are increasing portfolio allocations to a broader range of strategies across the risk-return spectrum. We\u2019re seeing increased democratization of alternatives with meaningfully increased retail allocations through multiple channels. And we\u2019re seeing industry consolidation as investors consolidate relationships with larger scale managers, which is driving capital toward platforms like ours, just to name a few. We believe that Ares is at the leading edge of this evolution and that our business has never been better positioned to drive long-term growth and corresponding value for all of our stakeholders. I want to end by expressing my appreciation for all the hard work and dedication of our team. The amazing growth and investment performance that we\u2019ve delivered is a direct result of our employees\u2019 strong commitment to collaborate, work as a team with a shared set of common values. I\u2019m also deeply thankful for our investors\u2019 continued support in our company and confidence in us. And thank you for your time today. And operator, we\u2019d now like to open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Robert Lee with KBW.\nRobert Lee: Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe Mike and Mike, to start. Just thinking about kind of your initiatives in the high-net-worth market. I mean, you talked about Pathfinder. You\u2019ve got Black Creek now on board. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of just kind of the size of distribution resources to more deeply penetrate that market. A combination of maybe what you acquired with Black Creek, plus what you\u2019ve kind of built that organically yourself then maybe to start there.\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. Hi, Robert. Why don\u2019t we start with Black Creek and how that changes our resource model and growth opportunity? And then maybe I\u2019ll circle back on other ways that we are delivering product into the retail and high-net-worth channel because I think there\u2019s a lot of attention on non-traded product but maybe not as much attention on some of the in-place initiatives as well in fund structures. Black Creek, obviously, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, brings a very differentiated industrial, real estate capability to us and core/core-plus product offerings. But one of the biggest drivers of value is going to be pushing more Ares Management product through what we believe is a best-in-class retail platform. As it exists today, largely servicing the U.S. retail investor is an 80-person distribution capability that came with Black Creek. And if you look at the publicly available information, you\u2019ll see that the sales of the Black Creek non-traded REIT product is accelerating. I think it\u2019s a function of good performance but also just a function of increased appetite from the retail investor. So that puts us in a very, very differentiated competitive position in terms of the reach that we have and the number of resources that we have against that market. To remind people, though, we already have a significant amount of product that is touching the retail investor. ARCC, at the top of the list, publicly traded, obviously, has helped build our brand within the retail channel and within the warehouses and RIAs. Hopefully, you saw last night, ARCC continues to grow by accessing the retail market just through regular way equity capital markets activity. Same for our publicly traded mortgage REIT, ACRE, which continues to grow and deliver great performance for their investors as well. So I think it\u2019s important when we\u2019re talking about retail that we do focus on the opportunity in non-traded. That is probably where a disproportionate amount of growth is. But we already have a meaningful leadership position in traditional traded and listed retail product. One other thing I would highlight is at the upper end of the retail spectrum in terms of high net worth and ultra-high net worth, as a regular ordinary course business, we are typically distributing our institutional fund product into that part of the market through our relationships with the private banks as well as direct through our institutional fundraising resources as well. So very bullish Black Creek will transform our capability. We believe we already have a leadership position. We think that this will accelerate it and look forward to keep you guys updated on our progress there.\nRobert Lee: Great. Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlex Blostein: Hi, guys. Great. Good afternoon. I was hoping to start with a question around direct lending market. Mike, thought your comments were interesting with more sponsors looking to partner with Ares, I guess, on the back of some of the challenges they face with syndicated markets amid the pandemic last year. I guess as you think about the market opportunity here, what do you see as direct lending share of sort of sponsor-backed loan market today? What do you think that could go realistically? And kind of how does Ares\u2019 market share within that market is evolving?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. It\u2019s a good question, and I don\u2019t think I can give you a specific answer to the sponsor\u2019s share. And part of that is because the sponsor\u2019s share of the liquid markets moves around. And obviously, the private markets, while they\u2019re getting a little bit more transparent in terms of size and scope, we don\u2019t have perfect information. I\u2019ll let maybe Kipp or someone else correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but I would say if you look at historical averages, sponsor-backed issuance has probably been in the 25% to 30% of that addressable market range. And we are seeing a disproportionate amount of sponsor activity coming out of the liquid markets into the private markets for all the reasons that we talked about around certainty of closing, speed of execution, flexibility of capital and so on and so forth. Obviously, if you look at the current addressable market, we\u2019re probably talking about a $1.5 trillion TAM as we see it today in the U.S. alone, and the European market is very quickly catching up to it. So, one of the reasons you\u2019re seeing such good continued and consistent growth in our direct lending franchise is the market is growing and we\u2019re taking share in that growing market. But our market share, despite all of our growth and size and competitive advantage is still pretty small. You could cut it in many different ways, but it\u2019s probably somewhere in the 3% to 5% range in our most mature direct lending franchises and in our most mature markets, which we think leaves us a lot of white space for growth in our mature markets but obviously, significant growth in the markets that are still evolving and developing. I would expect the trend to continue. Most sponsors are, I think, now convinced of the value proposition of private market execution. Clearly, there is a size of company or a type of company that will be able to get better price execution in the liquid markets, so it\u2019s not going to be a death now for the liquid markets. But I think at the lower end of those markets and the upper end of the private markets, you\u2019ll continue to see private markets taking share and the bigger platforms taking a share of that private market share gain.\nAlex Blostein: Great, helpful context. Thanks for that. And then just my follow-up question for the other Mike maybe around a couple of numbers here. So one, could you help us with Black Creek\u2019s revenue and expenses for the third quarter? And I guess, how do you plan to squeeze incentive fees from that business? Is that going to be part of the FRE or not? And then just maybe broadly, given the number of moving pieces, can you help us with a sort of pro forma jumping-off point for FRE and margins into the third quarter? And I know I think you said ultimately, you expect FRE margins to go up from there. So maybe a comment on kind of how you see that margin evolving over the next 12 months. Thanks.\nMike McFerran: Alex, with respect to Black Creek, we don\u2019t really have much more to say than we\u2019ve already said because we have \u2013 we want to go through a full quarter of actually, I mean, part of the firm. So I don\u2019t want to sit here on July 29, give an estimate for a portion of our business for the full quarter. It\u2019s just a little early for that. As we\u2019ve said before, in addition to the strategic accretion and how excited we are about Black Creek that Mike talked about, we do believe Black Creek\u2019s going to be financially accretive. But again, it\u2019s going to be one quarter, so as a percentage for the whole firm, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s overly material for a given quarter. When you think about the margin, you saw us progress to 39% this quarter. I don\u2019t expect, again, Black Creek to materially move up or down. And I think our trajectory is, as we\u2019ve been showing, continued margin expansion. I expect that to continue.\nAlex Blostein: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gerry O'Hara with Jefferies.\nGerry O'Hara: Great. Thanks. With, I guess, the two most recently announced deals kind of coming through and I think some prior commentary this morning about filling some of the product gaps, can you perhaps give us a little sense of where the M&A strategy might kind of progress from here, where there might be additional opportunities to fill any other gaps or just broadly how you\u2019re kind of thinking about that sort of strategy on a go-forward basis? Thank you.\nMichael Arougheti: Good morning, Gerry. So, I\u2019ll just quickly reiterate what we\u2019ve said in the past, which is the bar for M&A is getting higher, both because our product set and capability set is getting deeper and more developed. But as we scale, our ability to organically grow businesses is improving dramatically. And so, the buy versus build equation is shifting towards building versus buying. And so, we buy typically when we see a large market opportunity that we believe we want to accelerate into. So, using secondaries as an example, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we think that that market is going through transformational change. And in order to really take advantage of that growth opportunity globally, you need to do it with a scaled capital base, a history of information advantages and technology and track record. And so, while we could build a secondaries business organically and have been investing in and around that market, our view was, in order to really have the meaningful position that we wanted to, given our capability set, that we would buy it. So, the filter of financial accretion, strategic accretion and cultural fit is still there, but maybe I would add, we have to have conviction in a growth market where we have a sense of urgency about acquiring capability or a position in that market, Black Creek and Landmark being two great examples of that. And going back over a year, SSG providing us a beachhead into the growing Asia Pacific region would be another. There are very few opportunity sets as I see them globally in alternatives where I have that sense of urgency right now. We have talked about historically the opportunity that we see in global infrastructure and non-energy infrastructure in the U.S. Obviously, there is the potential for increased fiscal spend to support the growth of the U.S. market that\u2019s also informing our view of what the business could be here. We have a meaningful infrastructure equity and credit business and continue to scale that quite nicely organically. But as I've mentioned on prior calls, I think, that would be an example of maybe an area where with increased global growth in that market, we may do something inorganic that would complement what our current capability set is. So, the list is getting shorter. We have a lot of opportunity in front of us to continue to drive revenue synergies with the core business and the acquisitions that we've made. I'd make one final comment, which is, I think, just an important reminder. When we are growing businesses, the playbook is the same, right? It's acquire, retain and advance great talent. It's scale our capital. It's broaden out the product set. It's globalize investment origination, all the things you've seen us do. And that playbook is the same whether we're making an acquisition or building something organically. So I'd encourage you guys to think of the question of buy versus build is really what's my entry point? But from the point that something enters the firm, whether it was acquired or built, we're executing on growth identically. And that's why we've been so confident making these tuck-in acquisitions into these markets just because of the proven ability to build organically as well.\nGerry O'Hara: All right, that's helpful. And then maybe just kind of picking up on some comments around the kind of Landmark deal, I think you mentioned a range of synergies and product extensions. I know it's still \u2013 it's probably too early, but is there anything you might be able to elaborate on there? Perhaps a teaser as to what some of those product extensions might be? Or just any additional color would be helpful. Thank you.\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, sure. Happy to. So Landmark obviously has been in the secondaries business for 30 years. I think it's safe to say that they pioneered the industry. They have an incredible track record. They are currently in the market with their 17th private equity fund, just to give people a sense for the depth of experience there, and they're in the market with their 9th real estate fund, again just to demonstrate the depth of experience there. Recently, they closed on their second infrastructure fund. So, as we talked about when we were making the acquisition, the transformational growth that we're seeing in secondaries is in a couple of areas: one, there's a shift from what I would call LP-led to GP-led, meaning we used to provide secondary solutions to institutional LPs that were looking for liquidity within their alternative\u2019s portfolios. Now we're looking at providing liquidity solutions to GPs within their portfolios, either to own a great asset longer, fund strategic initiatives within the holding company and so on and so forth. That shift obviously plays into our strength, given our market-leading GP coverage network through our private credit business and our real estate businesses. It also plays to our strength as a direct investor whereas this market evolves, we'll be making much more single-asset and multi-asset buys versus big portfolio buys. Two, the growth is being driven by a shift away from private equity into places like real estate and infra and now credit. And three, it's being driven by what I would call just generally a globalization of the business, whereas to start, you've seen a lot of volume in the U.S. market and the European market. We're seeing Europe accelerate and Asia accelerate as well. And then fourth, back to the question on Black Creek, I think that as you think about the reutilization of private equity, particularly some of the questions or some of the opportunities that are being talked about to allow for private equity ownership within 401K and defined contribution plans, the best way to access that exposure will be through secondaries portfolios. And so, we think that, that should create an opportunity as well. So long-winded answer, with that as a backdrop, I think the big growth areas are continue to grow the core, which they are doing; add credit because we have a market-leading credit business and should be able to add value there; three, globalize the product offering; and maybe four, leverage our capabilities and our growing retail distribution capability to start to think about how we deliver that product into the retail channel.\nGerry O'Hara: Really helpful. Thanks for taking my questions this morning.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kenneth Lee with RBC Capital Markets.\nKenneth Lee: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just one on the Apsidal business. Wondering if you could just talk about how, you currently see the opportunity for potential sizable reinsurance transactions in this environment? Thanks.\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. I'm glad you asked. We are thrilled with where we are on the Apsidal business build. As folks have heard us say before, we have chosen to take a modest inorganic start to the business but are really focused on growing that business organically through our distribution of fixed index and fixed annuity product as well as the growth of the reinsurance business. To remind people, the basis or the foundation for that business build is coming through two acquisitions that have closed. One is the acquisition of F&G Re, which has been rebranded Aspida Re. Hopefully, you've seen we've been adding a significant amount of talent into that business, not the least of which is John Steffen, who just joined as the president of Aspida Re, previously with Athene. We continue to add new reinsurance treaties; we're adding new flow agreements. And I'd say both the growth in flow agreements and the pipeline of inorganic opportunity there is probably better than we expected it to be. And I think that's a reflection of the market backdrop but also the quality of the people that we're putting around that business. With regard to the life business, hopefully, folks saw, we finally completed, which better late than never but finally completed the acquisition of Global Bankers or GBIG, as we call it. We're surrounding that servicing and distribution capability with a 48-state life insurance business, and we think that we will be actively writing new business early in 2022. At the end of Q2, we had close to $3 billion, about $2.7 billion of AUM on the platform and growing, and that's obviously before we were tackling the organic build. So really happy with the progress. It's doing everything we hoped it would be. We're attracting top-flight talent. And I think the market backdrop is great, both for the organic and to your question, the reinsurance acquisition pipeline is pretty robust right now, both for small deals and some larger things as well.\nKenneth Lee: Great, that's very helpful. And just one follow-up, if I may, just in terms of the change in FRE growth outlook to that 20%-plus range. Was that mainly due to the benefit from Landmark and Black Creek? Or were there any other factors that we should be cognizant of? Thanks.\nMike McFerran: No. I mean, look, we obviously did it including Black Creek and Landmark. But as you've seen, we've been running, obviously, well north of 15% growth. So, we thought it was the right inflection point with \u2013 announcing the acquisition of Landmark or certainly of Black Creek to update that outlook. But I would \u2013 I\u2019d say it\u2019s a combination of adding those businesses, and what you\u2019ve seen is our strong organic growth ex those businesses.\nKenneth Lee: Great. Very helpful. Thanks again.\nMike McFerran: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. You guys mentioned the opportunity set in the private REIT space, but just curious to hear your perspective on potential for a private BDC. You manage the leading listed BDC, but could there be an opportunity on a non-listed BDC or is that a conflict to have both? And if you \u2013 and if it\u2019s not and if you were to go down that path, how might that sort of structure differ just in terms of economics and investment strategy if you were to have a private non-listed BDC?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, it\u2019s a good question. I mean, in terms of a BDC structure used to do what we currently do, there\u2019s really no strategic rationale to do that. We\u2019ve got a close to $18 billion publicly traded balance sheet with a high investment grade rating, consistent access to the debt and equity markets, lots of diversification, 17-year track record of outperformance. There\u2019s \u2013 really there\u2019s no rationale for a private BDC that would mimic things that we\u2019re doing elsewhere today. I\u2019d remind folks that we do already have a growing interval fund product that is a diversified credit product that is investing across the broad spectrum of what we do at Ares in the liquid and illiquid credit markets. And that\u2019s a good example of how we\u2019re using the non-traded markets to diversify and differentiate the capital but not really cannibalize or compete with the core business. I could imagine there may be certain industry-specific strategies or specific corners of the market where a private BDC would be the most efficient place to grow. And so, I wouldn\u2019t rule that out as an avenue for growth, but it would be for a product that is kind of a non-ARCC type product. If we, did it, I have high conviction in our ability to access that market, just given the success of our listed BDC as well as the private market and wealth relationships that we have. But I don\u2019t think that we have the same urgency to hit that market the way some of our peers are doing. To your question about economics, it\u2019s hopefully not lost on people, too, that the economics in that market, at least from the management standpoint, you have a lot of people who are discounting fees in an effort to try to raise capital in that market. And while we obviously are always thinking about the balance between our private investors and our public investors, we\u2019re not really in the business of doing that and nor do we think that we have to.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thanks. And just maybe a follow-up question, if I could. The U.S. direct lending fund, I think you mentioned you\u2019ve already raised over $5 billion. Can you just talk a bit about the outlook for putting that capital to work, the types of transactions you may anticipate playing that into? Is that all sponsor-financed? Is there anything outside of sponsor-financed? And how do you see the opportunity set evolving?\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. So there, we specifically referenced two funds and maybe kind of mentioned a third, but let\u2019s hit each of them. So, these are both flagship funds. They\u2019re the second fund in their families. The first one is what we call SDL, Senior Direct Lending. It is a senior secured lending product focused on the U.S. market. It is not exclusively sponsor-financed. But again, back to the earlier commentary, a large percentage of that market is sponsor-driven. Our first fund was about $4.5 billion, maybe $4 billion. We put $4.5 billion target for our second fund. We've already had a first closing well in excess of $5 billion and that fund will take on leverage. So, a lot of demand for the product off of great performance in Fund I and just people wanting to access our U.S. direct lending franchise. Sorry, Fund I was $3 billion. So, we don't know where that will land. We'll have an update for you all next quarter and as we get into the end of the year, but clearly, will be a sizable fund well in excess of the target. Already actively deploying into that market and no real change in strategy there. The second fund is what we call our private capital solutions fund or credit solutions fund. It's a junior capital fund. Our first fund there, again, I think, was about $3.4 billion. We've already raised $3.6 billion into Fund II against the $4 billion target. My expectation is we'll meet or exceed that target as we head into the end of the year as well. So those are two institutional U.S. direct lending funds, one senior secured, one junior, and they obviously complement the BDC and our SMA portfolios as we think about just different investor bases, different types of capital and that flexibility and scale benefit that I talk about so often. The third fund, which is not in that core direct lending but is effectively a direct lending fund, is our sports, media and entertainment fund, which I mentioned, is off to a great start, both in terms of fundraising and capital deployment. I think I mentioned that only because it's a good example of the type of step-out strategies that we can scale organically in industry verticals off of the core franchise.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thanks so much.\nMichael Arougheti: Sure.\nOperator: At this time, I'm showing no further questions, so I'd like to hand the call back to Michael Arougheti for any closing remarks.\nMichael Arougheti: Great. Thank you. And again, I just want to reiterate our gratitude for your continued support of the company and appreciate your time today. I do want to remind folks that we will be hosting our annual Investor Day on August 12. So please save the date, and we will be coming back with more details in the near future on that and so look forward to speaking to many of you on the 12th. Have a great week.\nOperator: If you missed any part of today's call, an archived replay of this conference call will be available through August 26, 2021, by dialing 877 344-7529 and to international callers by dialing one 412 317-0088.

            "name": "Mike McFerran",
            "content": "Thanks Mike. Hello, everyone. I hope everyone remains safe and well. As Mike mentioned, the second quarter not only represented our 17th consecutive quarter of sequential FRE growth, but our record financial results and capital raising, robust deployment and strong fund performance collectively continue to reflect the continued growth and durability of our uniquely differentiated and diversified business. I\u2019ll start my comments with a review of AUM and fee-paying AUM before turning to our quarterly results as these metrics provide the foundation of our current and future management of performance fees. As of June 30, our AUM totaled $247.9 billion compared to $197 billion at year-end and up more than 56% versus $158.4 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2020. Our AUM growth for the quarter was driven by over $20 billion of capital raise that Mike described and the closing of our acquisition of Landmark Partners in June, which added approximately $19.5 billion of AUM. With over $30 billion of capital raised in the first half of the year, we are well on our way to exceeding the record $41 billion that we raised in 2020. Our fee-paying AUM totaled $153.7 billion at the end of the second quarter, an increase of 46% from prior year, driven by continued strong deployment in our direct lending, alternative credit and special opportunity strategies as well as continued strong fundraising. The closing of Landmark Partners added $16.8 billion of fee-paying AUM during the quarter. Our available capital sits at $76 billion at the end of the second quarter, having a new record high for the firm and up nearly 100% year-over-year. This balance represents a significant competitive advantage for deployment as markets continue to open up further across sectors. Next, I will turn to our earnings for the quarter. For the second quarter, we reported FRE of $146.9 million, an increase of 52% over prior year. Our growth in FRE reflects both continued management fee growth and continued margin expansion. Management and other fees increased to $380.1 million for the second quarter, a 35% increase from prior year. Our second quarter FRE margin of 39% is a new record and is 425 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2020. As you see in our earnings presentation, we ended the second quarter with $42.6 billion of AUM not yet paying fees available for future deployment, a 70% increase from prior year. The $42.6 billion translates into $400.9 million of incremental annual management fees, which is approximately 30% of our last 12 months\u2019 management fees. These management fees will come online at a higher margin than our currently reported margin as this revenue growth is following expenses that have already been incurred. For example, as we raise a new fund that pays us on invested capital, our cost to raise the capital, the cost for distribution and our IR teams, our investment teams and our business operation teams were already largely reflected in our P&L. This trend is not new and is why you witnessed continued a more recently accelerating margin expansion. In addition to strong FRE growth, we experienced even higher realized income growth, with realized income for the second quarter totaling $206.9 million, an 80% increase over prior year that was driven through a combination of the over 50% year-over-year FRE growth that I already referenced and an increase of more than 300% and net realized performance income from the prior year period. After-tax realized income per share of Class A common stock, net of preferred stock distributions, was $0.64 per share for the second quarter, up 64% from prior year. We are in a period that provides a strong market backdrop for realizations. And our model is diversified, where we have the opportunity to realize performance income from realizations to the full or partial exit of positions and strategies like private equity and real estate. And our credit business enables us to earn performance income more consistently over the typical life cycle of those funds. The second quarter reflects this as all businesses contributed to our performance income for the quarter, with two-thirds of that income coming from our credit business. We expect this trend to continue, especially as we get into the later part of 2022 and to early 2023 as many of our flagship credit funds are expected to be generating distributions from their European waterfall structures. Sitting here today, we believe the outlook for performance income generation is strong, as demonstrated through our record level of accrued net performance income balance of $615.6 million at quarter end, an increase of over 110% from a year ago. In addition, incentive-eligible AUM also achieved a new record of $151.3 billion at quarter end, a 65% increase from prior year. Approximately 58% of our incentive-eligible AUM is currently invested at quarter end, with 72% of that already incentive generating. I do want to highlight that if you exclude ARCC\u2019s Part II incentive-generating AUM, which we have discussed before, has been episodic and are generating incentives on a recurring basis, approximately 90% of our deployed incentive-eligible AUM is currently incentive-generating. As Mike stated, included in incentive-generating AUM at quarter end was our fifth corporate private equity fund that crossed into carry generation in the second quarter and a strong performance pushed the fund fully through the GPLP catch-up and into full carry mode. We were also very active in the capital markets in the second quarter. In early April, we completed a public equity offering and a concurrent private placement, which raised $828 million. In late June, we took advantage of an attractive rate environment to issue $450 million of 4.18% 30-year fixed rate resettable subordinated notes. And lastly, on June 30, we redeemed our previously outstanding $310 million of Series A 7% preferred stock issuance. Our equity and debt issuances strengthen our liquidity position, which supported the acquisition of Landmark Partners in June and our acquisition of Black Creek just after quarter-end on July 1. Pro forma for these transactions, we remain in a strong liquidity position with low net leverage, and I\u2019m confident that we wouldn\u2019t realistically consider returning to the equity markets for capital in the foreseeable future. Most importantly, we believe that with the capital market activities and the acquisitions we made this quarter are meaningfully accretive to our earnings and dividend going forward. As many of you know, in conjunction with the Black Creek announcement, we upped our long-term financial guidance on FRE growth from 15%-plus to 20%-plus, inclusive of these two transactions. And we included a target of 20%-plus growth rate in our dividends per common share. This guidance illustrates the confidence we have both in our core business and the growth opportunity with these two strategic transactions. With that, I\u2019m going to hand this back over to Mike. Alex, with respect to Black Creek, we don\u2019t really have much more to say than we\u2019ve already said because we have \u2013 we want to go through a full quarter of actually, I mean, part of the firm. So I don\u2019t want to sit here on July 29, give an estimate for a portion of our business for the full quarter. It\u2019s just a little early for that. As we\u2019ve said before, in addition to the strategic accretion and how excited we are about Black Creek that Mike talked about, we do believe Black Creek\u2019s going to be financially accretive. But again, it\u2019s going to be one quarter, so as a percentage for the whole firm, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s overly material for a given quarter. When you think about the margin, you saw us progress to 39% this quarter. I don\u2019t expect, again, Black Creek to materially move up or down. And I think our trajectory is, as we\u2019ve been showing, continued margin expansion. I expect that to continue. No. I mean, look, we obviously did it including Black Creek and Landmark. But as you've seen, we've been running, obviously, well north of 15% growth. So, we thought it was the right inflection point with \u2013 announcing the acquisition of Landmark or certainly of Black Creek to update that outlook. But I would \u2013 I\u2019d say it\u2019s a combination of adding those businesses, and what you\u2019ve seen is our strong organic growth ex those businesses. All right. Thank you."

            "name": "Michael Arougheti",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Carl, and good afternoon, everybody. I hope you are doing well. As our second quarter's results demonstrate, we continue to hit on all cylinders in our core business with a record quarter of fundraising, AUM metrics, management fees, fee-related earnings, FRE margin and realized income. During the second quarter, our top line management fees increased 34%, our FRE increased by 52% and our realized income grew 80%, all on a year-over-year basis. Our fee-related earnings increased sequentially for the 17th consecutive quarter, which we believe speaks to the stability and consistency behind the growth trajectory of our management fee-centric business model. We raised more than $20 billion in new capital across the platform, which puts us at more than $30 billion raised for the first half of the year. This compares to our record full year fundraising of $41 billion last year. Our quarterly fund performance was also the strongest quarter of fund appreciation in our firm's history. The second half of 2021 and beyond looks promising for us as our transaction and fundraising pipelines both remain elevated, and we believe that the market environment remains conducive for additional realization activity. We've also added several new growth engines to the platform, which strengthens our confidence in our ability to drive continued shareholder value and long-term growth of 20% or more in our FRE and dividends in the coming years. During the second quarter, we executed on our strategic vision to scale and expand our product suite, closing our previously announced acquisition of Landmark Partners on June two and creating our new secondary solutions group. We believe that the secondaries industry is at an inflection point, and the combination of Landmark's industry leadership and our global sponsor and investor relationships will provide us with meaningful growth opportunities. We're focused on integrating this business and capitalizing on a range of revenue synergies and potential product expansions. Just after quarter end, we meaningfully scaled our Real Estate Group by closing on our acquisition of Black Creek Group, which had approximately $13.7 billion of AUM as of June 30. Black Creek is a vertically integrated real estate manager, predominantly offering core and core-plus strategies with a long and successful track record. Adding a premier core/core-plus manager fills a product gap for us within our real estate product offering, and we can now offer a complete suite across the risk-return spectrum to our real estate investors. The company is also one of the three largest industrial real estate investors in the U.S., which is Ares' highest-conviction global real estate sector and one with favorable long-term demand drivers.  Black Creek's 100 investment professionals with locations across the U.S. will also meaningfully enhance our scale and visibility on transactions and market coverage. Importantly, Black Creek also operates one of the top non-traded REIT fundraising platforms in the country, which we believe, offers tremendous upside as we use our relationships to expand through global wealth platforms and add new retail-oriented products across all of our business lines. We're very excited about the opportunities for these growth engines as we leverage the power of our platform to enhance investor distribution and eventually expand our products into new business opportunities. With these highly attractive and financially accretive acquisitions in place, we are intensely focused on recognizing the many revenue synergy opportunities in front of us, which we expect will enhance our earnings growth in future years. We also continue to progress with our insurance initiative. With Aspida's recently closed Global Bankers Insurance Group transaction, we added the marketing, technology and infrastructure that will provide the foundation for underwriting new life insurance and annuity products, which we expect to begin next year. We also continue to add new flow reinsurance contracts, and we're seeing a growing number of sub-advisory management services for Aspida's portfolio across the firm. On the investor front, we continue to benefit from the strong secular tailwinds driving the demand for alternative private assets and investor thirst for durable yield. As we scale, more investors are coming on to our platform and then allocating additional funds to us. Investors are finding that we can provide solutions to meet their desire for consistent and attractive risk-adjusted investment returns throughout market cycles. Following our strong first quarter with $10.6 billion raised, we raised more than $20 billion in organic capital during the second quarter, with over 80% of the direct institutional capital coming from existing investors. We saw contributions across all of our investment groups with large closings in U.S. and European direct lending, liquid and alternative credit, real estate, private equity, including climate infrastructure, secondary solutions and Asian secured lending. A perfect example of the strong demand that we're seeing is through our first closing of $5.1 billion for our second U.S. senior direct lending fund, which is already in excess of its $4.5 billion target and 70% larger than our predecessor fund size. On this first close, we had very strong participation from existing investors, with 43 out of the total 54 investors as existing Ares clients. Interestingly, our two largest investors in the first close are longtime Ares investors, making their first commitment to U.S. direct lending. We also saw significant support from the predecessor fund investors with over 20 committing and upsizing by 20% on average. Based on anticipated fund leverage, the total fund capital after the first close is expected to be more than $8.5 billion, and we're continuing our fundraising efforts and expect the final size to grow from there. Also, within credit, we followed up with another meaningful close of $1.7 billion for our second U.S. junior capital direct lending fund, bringing total commitments to $3.6 billion, also already ahead of our last fund. We continue to fundraise and expect to exceed our $4 billion target in the near future. During the second quarter, and as we previously announced, we also held our final close for ACE V, which added another \u20ac1.5 billion in LP commitments. And by adding in a modest debt facility, ACE V is now over \u20ac13 billion or $15.6 billion in size. ACE V is off to an excellent start with more than 20% of the fund already committed with new investments. Our strong and consistent performance within our Real Estate Group and our ability to source and manage off-market assets is translating into significant momentum in our real estate fundraising as well. We held the first close of more than $600 million for our tenth U.S. value-add real estate fund, which is nearly halfway to our target. And we added more than \u20ac600 million in our third European value-add fund, including related co-investments. We expect both funds to meet or exceed their targets as well. We also held the final closing of SLO III, Ares SSG's third flagship fund and secure direct lending. SLO III closed on $1.6 billion in commitments, which was approximately double the size of the successor fund \u2013 predecessor fund, SLO II, and above our target of $1.5 billion. Ares SSG continues to see very strong demand for its products due to its differentiated pan-Asian private markets footprint. We're seeing strong momentum in capital raising through certain perpetual life open-ended vehicles. During the second quarter, Black Creek raised over $600 million of equity and additional $700 million of debt in its non-traded REIT platform. And just after quarter end, we held a $1.6 billion first close on our new open-end core alternative credit fund. This complementary fund, Pathfinder, is also managed by our alternative credit team where they focus on a broad range of core investments backed by assets with contractual cash flows. Going forward, we continue to focus on launching more perpetual life and open-ended capital vehicles. Looking forward, we have a strong pipeline of funds in the market across all of our businesses, and we expect 2021 will exceed our 2020 record of $41 billion. In terms of larger flagship funds, we expect additional closings in our sixth corporate private equity fund, our second special opportunities fund, our inaugural climate infrastructure fund, our sixth Asian Special Sits Fund, our two aforementioned U.S. flagship direct lending funds, our U.S. and European real estate funds, our 17th private equity fund \u2013 secondaries fund, our 9th real estate secondaries fund and our inaugural sports, media and entertainment fund, just to name several. We also have several new strategies that we plan to launch over the next 12 months. Our broader platform has clearly set us up for a deeper and more diverse fundraising pipeline as investor appetite for our private market alternatives is increasing. The investing environment is very attractive, reflecting improving confidence on the part of businesses and investors. In that context, we had a strong deployment quarter with over $10 billion invested, with $8.1 billion in our drawdown funds versus $4.7 billion for the same period last year, an increase of 72%. Our ability to continue to find attractive deployment opportunities across our businesses illustrates the breadth of our extensive sourcing platform, our incumbency advantages across our funds, almost 3,000 portfolio companies and the meaningful competitive advantages that we've created with scale and flexible capital. In addition, we're seeing more companies and sponsors wanting to partner with us after seeing how many traditional sources of capital were less reliable during the pandemic. Many of our investment teams are seeing record levels of activity with strong future pipelines, while at the same time, taking advantage of our significant incumbent relationships to provide capital in situations where many of these transactions never come to the market for competition. And lastly, I'll touch on investment performance. As you can see throughout our earnings presentation, we had another very strong quarter of fund performance across our strategies, including quarterly gross returns in both our corporate private equity and our special opportunity strategies of 15% and U.S. equity real estate returns of more than 14% for the quarter. In our private equity group, corporate private equity and special opportunities achieved gross returns over the last 12 months of 55% and 58%, respectively. Of note, the group's largest fund, ACOF V, fully crossed into the carry during this time, with its since-inception IRR in the mid-teens as of quarter end. We also saw strong direct lending returns, with Ares Capital generating net returns of over 6% for the second quarter and more than 26% over the last 12 months, meaningfully outperforming the high-yield indices. And our liquid credit loan and high-yield composites also continued to outperform the relative benchmarks for the first half of the year. Overall, our strong fund performance more than doubled our accrued net performance income as Mike will touch on in a moment. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Mike McFerran for his remarks on our business positioning and our financial results. Mike? Great. Thanks, Mike. As we\u2019ve talked in the past, our industry has been undergoing meaningful transformation and rapid growth, and it\u2019s being driven by secular changes that we believe are accelerating. Institutional investors are increasing portfolio allocations to a broader range of strategies across the risk-return spectrum. We\u2019re seeing increased democratization of alternatives with meaningfully increased retail allocations through multiple channels. And we\u2019re seeing industry consolidation as investors consolidate relationships with larger scale managers, which is driving capital toward platforms like ours, just to name a few. We believe that Ares is at the leading edge of this evolution and that our business has never been better positioned to drive long-term growth and corresponding value for all of our stakeholders. I want to end by expressing my appreciation for all the hard work and dedication of our team. The amazing growth and investment performance that we\u2019ve delivered is a direct result of our employees\u2019 strong commitment to collaborate, work as a team with a shared set of common values. I\u2019m also deeply thankful for our investors\u2019 continued support in our company and confidence in us. And thank you for your time today. And operator, we\u2019d now like to open up the line for questions. Sure. Hi, Robert. Why don\u2019t we start with Black Creek and how that changes our resource model and growth opportunity? And then maybe I\u2019ll circle back on other ways that we are delivering product into the retail and high-net-worth channel because I think there\u2019s a lot of attention on non-traded product but maybe not as much attention on some of the in-place initiatives as well in fund structures. Black Creek, obviously, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, brings a very differentiated industrial, real estate capability to us and core/core-plus product offerings. But one of the biggest drivers of value is going to be pushing more Ares Management product through what we believe is a best-in-class retail platform. As it exists today, largely servicing the U.S. retail investor is an 80-person distribution capability that came with Black Creek. And if you look at the publicly available information, you\u2019ll see that the sales of the Black Creek non-traded REIT product is accelerating. I think it\u2019s a function of good performance but also just a function of increased appetite from the retail investor. So that puts us in a very, very differentiated competitive position in terms of the reach that we have and the number of resources that we have against that market. To remind people, though, we already have a significant amount of product that is touching the retail investor. ARCC, at the top of the list, publicly traded, obviously, has helped build our brand within the retail channel and within the warehouses and RIAs. Hopefully, you saw last night, ARCC continues to grow by accessing the retail market just through regular way equity capital markets activity. Same for our publicly traded mortgage REIT, ACRE, which continues to grow and deliver great performance for their investors as well. So I think it\u2019s important when we\u2019re talking about retail that we do focus on the opportunity in non-traded. That is probably where a disproportionate amount of growth is. But we already have a meaningful leadership position in traditional traded and listed retail product. One other thing I would highlight is at the upper end of the retail spectrum in terms of high net worth and ultra-high net worth, as a regular ordinary course business, we are typically distributing our institutional fund product into that part of the market through our relationships with the private banks as well as direct through our institutional fundraising resources as well. So very bullish Black Creek will transform our capability. We believe we already have a leadership position. We think that this will accelerate it and look forward to keep you guys updated on our progress there. Yes. It\u2019s a good question, and I don\u2019t think I can give you a specific answer to the sponsor\u2019s share. And part of that is because the sponsor\u2019s share of the liquid markets moves around. And obviously, the private markets, while they\u2019re getting a little bit more transparent in terms of size and scope, we don\u2019t have perfect information. I\u2019ll let maybe Kipp or someone else correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but I would say if you look at historical averages, sponsor-backed issuance has probably been in the 25% to 30% of that addressable market range. And we are seeing a disproportionate amount of sponsor activity coming out of the liquid markets into the private markets for all the reasons that we talked about around certainty of closing, speed of execution, flexibility of capital and so on and so forth. Obviously, if you look at the current addressable market, we\u2019re probably talking about a $1.5 trillion TAM as we see it today in the U.S. alone, and the European market is very quickly catching up to it. So, one of the reasons you\u2019re seeing such good continued and consistent growth in our direct lending franchise is the market is growing and we\u2019re taking share in that growing market. But our market share, despite all of our growth and size and competitive advantage is still pretty small. You could cut it in many different ways, but it\u2019s probably somewhere in the 3% to 5% range in our most mature direct lending franchises and in our most mature markets, which we think leaves us a lot of white space for growth in our mature markets but obviously, significant growth in the markets that are still evolving and developing. I would expect the trend to continue. Most sponsors are, I think, now convinced of the value proposition of private market execution. Clearly, there is a size of company or a type of company that will be able to get better price execution in the liquid markets, so it\u2019s not going to be a death now for the liquid markets. But I think at the lower end of those markets and the upper end of the private markets, you\u2019ll continue to see private markets taking share and the bigger platforms taking a share of that private market share gain. Good morning, Gerry. So, I\u2019ll just quickly reiterate what we\u2019ve said in the past, which is the bar for M&A is getting higher, both because our product set and capability set is getting deeper and more developed. But as we scale, our ability to organically grow businesses is improving dramatically. And so, the buy versus build equation is shifting towards building versus buying. And so, we buy typically when we see a large market opportunity that we believe we want to accelerate into. So, using secondaries as an example, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we think that that market is going through transformational change. And in order to really take advantage of that growth opportunity globally, you need to do it with a scaled capital base, a history of information advantages and technology and track record. And so, while we could build a secondaries business organically and have been investing in and around that market, our view was, in order to really have the meaningful position that we wanted to, given our capability set, that we would buy it. So, the filter of financial accretion, strategic accretion and cultural fit is still there, but maybe I would add, we have to have conviction in a growth market where we have a sense of urgency about acquiring capability or a position in that market, Black Creek and Landmark being two great examples of that. And going back over a year, SSG providing us a beachhead into the growing Asia Pacific region would be another. There are very few opportunity sets as I see them globally in alternatives where I have that sense of urgency right now. We have talked about historically the opportunity that we see in global infrastructure and non-energy infrastructure in the U.S. Obviously, there is the potential for increased fiscal spend to support the growth of the U.S. market that\u2019s also informing our view of what the business could be here. We have a meaningful infrastructure equity and credit business and continue to scale that quite nicely organically. But as I've mentioned on prior calls, I think, that would be an example of maybe an area where with increased global growth in that market, we may do something inorganic that would complement what our current capability set is. So, the list is getting shorter. We have a lot of opportunity in front of us to continue to drive revenue synergies with the core business and the acquisitions that we've made. I'd make one final comment, which is, I think, just an important reminder. When we are growing businesses, the playbook is the same, right? It's acquire, retain and advance great talent. It's scale our capital. It's broaden out the product set. It's globalize investment origination, all the things you've seen us do. And that playbook is the same whether we're making an acquisition or building something organically. So I'd encourage you guys to think of the question of buy versus build is really what's my entry point? But from the point that something enters the firm, whether it was acquired or built, we're executing on growth identically. And that's why we've been so confident making these tuck-in acquisitions into these markets just because of the proven ability to build organically as well.\nGerry O'Hara: All right, that's helpful. And then maybe just kind of picking up on some comments around the kind of Landmark deal, I think you mentioned a range of synergies and product extensions. I know it's still \u2013 it's probably too early, but is there anything you might be able to elaborate on there? Perhaps a teaser as to what some of those product extensions might be? Or just any additional color would be helpful. Thank you. Yes, sure. Happy to. So Landmark obviously has been in the secondaries business for 30 years. I think it's safe to say that they pioneered the industry. They have an incredible track record. They are currently in the market with their 17th private equity fund, just to give people a sense for the depth of experience there, and they're in the market with their 9th real estate fund, again just to demonstrate the depth of experience there. Recently, they closed on their second infrastructure fund. So, as we talked about when we were making the acquisition, the transformational growth that we're seeing in secondaries is in a couple of areas: one, there's a shift from what I would call LP-led to GP-led, meaning we used to provide secondary solutions to institutional LPs that were looking for liquidity within their alternative\u2019s portfolios. Now we're looking at providing liquidity solutions to GPs within their portfolios, either to own a great asset longer, fund strategic initiatives within the holding company and so on and so forth. That shift obviously plays into our strength, given our market-leading GP coverage network through our private credit business and our real estate businesses. It also plays to our strength as a direct investor whereas this market evolves, we'll be making much more single-asset and multi-asset buys versus big portfolio buys. Two, the growth is being driven by a shift away from private equity into places like real estate and infra and now credit. And three, it's being driven by what I would call just generally a globalization of the business, whereas to start, you've seen a lot of volume in the U.S. market and the European market. We're seeing Europe accelerate and Asia accelerate as well. And then fourth, back to the question on Black Creek, I think that as you think about the reutilization of private equity, particularly some of the questions or some of the opportunities that are being talked about to allow for private equity ownership within 401K and defined contribution plans, the best way to access that exposure will be through secondaries portfolios. And so, we think that, that should create an opportunity as well. So long-winded answer, with that as a backdrop, I think the big growth areas are continue to grow the core, which they are doing; add credit because we have a market-leading credit business and should be able to add value there; three, globalize the product offering; and maybe four, leverage our capabilities and our growing retail distribution capability to start to think about how we deliver that product into the retail channel.\nGerry O'Hara: Really helpful. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. Yes. I'm glad you asked. We are thrilled with where we are on the Apsidal business build. As folks have heard us say before, we have chosen to take a modest inorganic start to the business but are really focused on growing that business organically through our distribution of fixed index and fixed annuity product as well as the growth of the reinsurance business. To remind people, the basis or the foundation for that business build is coming through two acquisitions that have closed. One is the acquisition of F&G Re, which has been rebranded Aspida Re. Hopefully, you've seen we've been adding a significant amount of talent into that business, not the least of which is John Steffen, who just joined as the president of Aspida Re, previously with Athene. We continue to add new reinsurance treaties; we're adding new flow agreements. And I'd say both the growth in flow agreements and the pipeline of inorganic opportunity there is probably better than we expected it to be. And I think that's a reflection of the market backdrop but also the quality of the people that we're putting around that business. With regard to the life business, hopefully, folks saw, we finally completed, which better late than never but finally completed the acquisition of Global Bankers or GBIG, as we call it. We're surrounding that servicing and distribution capability with a 48-state life insurance business, and we think that we will be actively writing new business early in 2022. At the end of Q2, we had close to $3 billion, about $2.7 billion of AUM on the platform and growing, and that's obviously before we were tackling the organic build. So really happy with the progress. It's doing everything we hoped it would be. We're attracting top-flight talent. And I think the market backdrop is great, both for the organic and to your question, the reinsurance acquisition pipeline is pretty robust right now, both for small deals and some larger things as well. Yes, it\u2019s a good question. I mean, in terms of a BDC structure used to do what we currently do, there\u2019s really no strategic rationale to do that. We\u2019ve got a close to $18 billion publicly traded balance sheet with a high investment grade rating, consistent access to the debt and equity markets, lots of diversification, 17-year track record of outperformance. There\u2019s \u2013 really there\u2019s no rationale for a private BDC that would mimic things that we\u2019re doing elsewhere today. I\u2019d remind folks that we do already have a growing interval fund product that is a diversified credit product that is investing across the broad spectrum of what we do at Ares in the liquid and illiquid credit markets. And that\u2019s a good example of how we\u2019re using the non-traded markets to diversify and differentiate the capital but not really cannibalize or compete with the core business. I could imagine there may be certain industry-specific strategies or specific corners of the market where a private BDC would be the most efficient place to grow. And so, I wouldn\u2019t rule that out as an avenue for growth, but it would be for a product that is kind of a non-ARCC type product. If we, did it, I have high conviction in our ability to access that market, just given the success of our listed BDC as well as the private market and wealth relationships that we have. But I don\u2019t think that we have the same urgency to hit that market the way some of our peers are doing. To your question about economics, it\u2019s hopefully not lost on people, too, that the economics in that market, at least from the management standpoint, you have a lot of people who are discounting fees in an effort to try to raise capital in that market. And while we obviously are always thinking about the balance between our private investors and our public investors, we\u2019re not really in the business of doing that and nor do we think that we have to. Sure. So there, we specifically referenced two funds and maybe kind of mentioned a third, but let\u2019s hit each of them. So, these are both flagship funds. They\u2019re the second fund in their families. The first one is what we call SDL, Senior Direct Lending. It is a senior secured lending product focused on the U.S. market. It is not exclusively sponsor-financed. But again, back to the earlier commentary, a large percentage of that market is sponsor-driven. Our first fund was about $4.5 billion, maybe $4 billion. We put $4.5 billion target for our second fund. We've already had a first closing well in excess of $5 billion and that fund will take on leverage. So, a lot of demand for the product off of great performance in Fund I and just people wanting to access our U.S. direct lending franchise. Sorry, Fund I was $3 billion. So, we don't know where that will land. We'll have an update for you all next quarter and as we get into the end of the year, but clearly, will be a sizable fund well in excess of the target. Already actively deploying into that market and no real change in strategy there. The second fund is what we call our private capital solutions fund or credit solutions fund. It's a junior capital fund. Our first fund there, again, I think, was about $3.4 billion. We've already raised $3.6 billion into Fund II against the $4 billion target. My expectation is we'll meet or exceed that target as we head into the end of the year as well. So those are two institutional U.S. direct lending funds, one senior secured, one junior, and they obviously complement the BDC and our SMA portfolios as we think about just different investor bases, different types of capital and that flexibility and scale benefit that I talk about so often. The third fund, which is not in that core direct lending but is effectively a direct lending fund, is our sports, media and entertainment fund, which I mentioned, is off to a great start, both in terms of fundraising and capital deployment. I think I mentioned that only because it's a good example of the type of step-out strategies that we can scale organically in industry verticals off of the core franchise. Sure. Great. Thank you. And again, I just want to reiterate our gratitude for your continued support of the company and appreciate your time today. I do want to remind folks that we will be hosting our annual Investor Day on August 12. So please save the date, and we will be coming back with more details in the near future on that and so look forward to speaking to many of you on the 12th. Have a great week."

As a reminder this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, April 29th, 2021. I will now turn the call over to Carl Drake, Head of Public Company Investor Relations for Ares Management.\nCarl Drake: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today for our first quarter 2021 conference call. We hope everyone is safe and healthy. I'm joined today by Michael Arougheti our Chief Executive Officer; and Michael McFerran, our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. In addition Bennett Rosenthal, Co-Chairman of our Private Equity Group; Kipp DeVeer, Head of our Credit Group; and Matt Cwiertnia, Co-Head of our Private Equity Group will be available for the question-and-answer session.\nMichael Arougheti: Great. Thank you, Carl. Good afternoon everyone. I hope you are all healthy and wish you well. As the economy recovers on the backs of significant fiscal and monetary stimulus as well as progress on the healthcare front, we are off to a strong start this year across our business. Looking back at an unprecedented year of volatility and change, we believe that 2020 validated the resilience and durability of our business, the positive fundamental growth trends for our company, and the strong secular tailwinds driving the alternative asset management industry. As we look forward to the rest of 2021, we see a constructive market backdrop and continued momentum in the four core drivers of our business; strong fundraising, deployment, investment performance, and realizations. I'll speak to each of these specifically, but simply put, as we execute well on each of these fronts, we're confident in our ability to drive continued long-term value for our shareholders and to maintain our guidance of 15%-plus FRE growth for the foreseeable future.\nMichael McFerran: Thank you, Mike. Hello, everyone. I hope all of you are safe and well. I will start with a review of our strong first quarter results and our outlook for 2021. We continue to deliver across our core financial metrics with FRE, management fees, AUM, fee paying AUM and dry powder, all either at or near firm records. This performance is a testament to the resiliency of our firm despite the challenges presented in the last 12 months. Our fee-related earnings continues to grow quarter-over-quarter and this quarter's comparable FRE growth exceeded our expectations, as we are able to grow sequentially, despite an exceptionally strong fourth quarter of last year. For the first quarter, FRE totaled $128.5 million, an increase of 38% year-over-year compared to the first quarter of 2020. Our quarterly FRE margin reflects a firm record of 38.4%, nearly a 500 basis point improvement year-over-year, as we continue to deploy capital from our Shadow AUM, raise new capital and further scale our business lines. Of note, for the first quarter, our fee-related earnings comprise more than 90% of our realized income and for the last 12 months, FRE accounted for more than 75% of realized income. FRE for the first quarter was driven by management fees, totaling $327 million, an increase of approximately 20% over the first quarter of 2020. Turning to expenses. Our combined compensation and general and administrative expenses grew by approximately 11.5% compared to the first quarter of 2020. Realized income for the first quarter, totaled $137 million, up slightly year-over-year as most of our realizations came from a partial secondary sale in one of our private equity portfolio companies the AZEK Company. After-tax realized income per share of Class A common stock, net of preferred stock distributions was $0.46 per share for the first quarter, up from $0.45 in the first quarter of 2020.\nMichael Arougheti: Thanks, Mike. We believe that Ares is well positioned today to take advantage of our strong competitive position and the favorable tailwinds in the global alternative asset landscape. Investors are allocating more capital into alternative investments, while at the same time looking to consolidate the relationships with broader scale managers. This plays to our strength as a broad solutions provider having also delivered time-tested and attractive returns to our clients. Over the past five years we've achieved tremendous growth in the wallet share with our existing clients as they invest larger amounts in subsequent funds and expand their investment exposures across the Ares platform. We believe that these trends will continue.  As a result across the alternative landscape, we'll look to continue growing our products, capabilities and geographical reach to provide additional differentiated investment solutions for our clients. Mike mentioned with over $40 billion of AUM not yet paying fees, we have strong near-term visibility for earnings growth. When you add in the growth avenues that we have in large and expanding addressable markets, we believe that Ares is well positioned to remain a high-growth firm for many years to come. I want to end our prepared remarks by simply expressing how impressed and grateful and proud I am of the hard work and dedication of our team. The amazing growth and investment performance that we've delivered is a direct result of our employees' strong commitment to collaborate and work as a team with a shared set of common values. I'm also deeply appreciative of our investors' continued support for our company. And I thank you for your time today.  And with that operator, I think we'll open up the line for questions.\nOperator:  Our first question today comes from Robert Lee with KBW.\nRobert Lee : Thanks, Mike and Mike. Hope everyone is doing well. I just have a quick question on -- actually on your initiatives maybe in the high net worth channel. I mean, obviously, you have ARCC and ACRE. But can you maybe elaborate on how you're thinking about like some of your peers and have had their marketplace more broadly? And obviously, some peers have brought out their potentially non-traded real estate or credit products. So what are your -- how are you thinking about that at this point?\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. So we think about it a lot. I think the good news is we have a well-established brand in that channel already through the success of our listed vehicles in the form of ARCC, ACRE and ARDC. And we also have a pretty healthy track record of fundraising success and investment performance in the high net worth and ultra-high net worth segments of those systems as well. If you actually look at private banks over the last five years that's probably grown about 25% compound annual growth rate in terms of AUM in the channel. And high net worth has actually been our fastest-growing end segment with about 42% CAGR over the last five years. We're in that market with new product. I think we've talked about this on prior calls. We have a large and growing credit interval fund that's enjoying good success and performance. And our expectation is that we'll continue to put product through that channel over time.\nRobert Lee : Great. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up. I guess with AMP, I guess on the table at this point can you -- and if you could touch on it, but maybe update us on kind of how you're currently thinking about your M&A priorities or where size infrastructure may be where you'd seek out opportunities?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. We've talked about this before and maybe just to zoom out quickly and I mentioned this in our prepared remarks, when we think about growth, we think it's important that we are driving high organic growth and supplementing that growth with M&A. And you can see how some of the organic growth initiatives in places like alternative credit and special opportunities European direct lending are all bearing fruit and accelerating. We also continue to drive growth into step-out strategies across the platform and that's the biggest driver of our sustained growth. When we execute on M&A it typically is going to be either to tuck in a capability or a set of relationships that we don't currently have where we feel that we can acquire it at an attractive price that's strategic. And when we're talking about larger deals like a Landmark or like an AMP it's with a view that there is a large addressable market that is growing where we have maybe a heightened sense of urgency to be in that market in scale. So SSG is a good example of that as well where we believe that the long-term growth trends in Asia warranted an acquisition to acquire capability, track record, broad office footprint, multi-asset class capability, investor relationships, et cetera. Candidly and I've said this before, now that the firm is a $200 billion of AUM and we're enjoying the success that we are, the product gaps if you will are pretty narrow. Secondaries was a big part of it for us and Landmark has filled that gap. We continue to think that the infrastructure market is an area that we should be focusing on both organically and inorganically. We are growing well in our core infra business, but feel that we want to globalize and scale that. And then in and around real estate as we've talked about before just given the size of those addressable markets globally, we believe that there is an opportunity for us to continue to expand our real estate group through acquisition as well.\nRobert Lee: Great. Thanks so much.\nMichael Arougheti: Thanks Robert.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gerry O'Hara with Jefferies.\nGerry O'Hara: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon everybody. I was hoping one maybe for Mike McFerran but perhaps both of you guys can weigh in a little bit, just around the pace of deployment that we might be able to expect as it relates to the $48 billion of incentive eligible AUM that's not yet invested. And then perhaps if there's some color around deployment themes that you might be able to elaborate on a little bit that would be helpful? Thank you.\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. I can take a stab on that one. If you look at the composition of our dry powder today as Mike mentioned about $57 billion of available capital if you segmented that down to the AUM not yet earning fees, it's $40 billion, $34 billion of which sits within our global credit business. And for those of you who listened to the ARCC call yesterday, I think there was a pretty positive tone on the market backdrop for deployment. Obviously as the markets recover post-pandemic and liquidity in the markets persist, we just expect transaction activity to remain healthy if not elevated throughout the rest of the year. So as we sit here today, we had a very active Q1 on the heels of a very active Q4. And I remind people Q1 tends to be our seasonally slowest quarter for deployment so to see that deployment in Q1, I think is a really positive sign. I think the good news is that we're seeing deployment opportunities across the entirety of the platform. PE is very active. We're seeing transaction flow increasing there particularly as there's discussion about capital gains rate. So I think you should expect to see transaction activity increase. Real estate's active. So I'd say Gerry the good news is 15 months removed from the depths of the pandemic, the market's feeling pretty strong from a deployment standpoint. And I think that should translate in terms of the AUM not yet earning fees.\nGerry O'Hara: Great. Thanks for taking my questions this morning.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thanks. I hope you're all doing well and congrats on crossing $200 billion.\nMichael Arougheti: Thanks Craig.\nCraig Siegenthaler: So Mike after another record breaking direct lending fund in Europe, could you update us on the competitive landscape in private credit in Europe? And we're seeing larger capital raises across the industry. But I wanted to see how this is impacting spreads and credit quality and maybe you can highlight some of the moats that are in the Ares business?\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. And I'll address that and then Kipp is on the line too so if he has any color commentary, Kipp feel free to chime in. As we've talked about for now 20-plus years as the private credit markets have developed and we've solidified our leadership position, the moats simply put are origination advantages, i.e. more people in more offices with more local relationships. That sourcing engine at scale allows you to be much more selective in the deals that you do, which drives outperformance in credit. And I think that shines through when you look at our track record through cycles both in terms of the IRRs delivered but also the infinitesimal loss rates that we experienced. So order of magnitude in private credit, we have a close rate of about 3% to 5% of all the deals that come through the transom. And that origination engine drives credit performance. Scale of capital and flexibility of capital is also a pretty big advantage, which is why we're so pleased to see the scaling in Europe the way that we saw it in the U.S. The reason for that is you want to cover the broadest set of available market opportunities from the small end of the market to the large end of the market. And when you go through volatile markets like we went through in 2020, the ability to deliver certainty of close and flexibility of structure at scale is a pretty unique capability. And so you see us now in Europe doing what we've been doing in the US for years at the large end of the market which as Kipp talked about yesterday is actually offering some pretty compelling risk-adjusted return relative to the core middle market today. And then lastly, which is something that we're really enjoying and you really see the benefits of in a market like 2020 is just the value of incumbency. And year-in and year-out both in Europe and the US, we see that roughly 50% of our transaction flow in some cases north of that is coming from our existing portfolio as they're growing, deleveraging and releveraging, making acquisitions transitioning ownership. So when you build that big portfolio globally that we have the embedded value of being able to re-underwrite that portfolio and re-commit to it is a pretty big advantage. I think the competition it feels more competitive in the sense of the number of folks that have capital to deploy. But at the risk of sounding immodest I don't think that we're experiencing that increased liquidity as significantly more competition because of some of these competitive advantages that I talked about. In the European market in, particular, we have such a large advantage in terms of our capital base and the number of people that we have deployed against the market opportunity. We think that we've created some pretty significant white space between us and others in the market. The only other comment, I'd make to your question is in Europe, we're not seeing a meaningful impact on spreads and upfront fees from the amount of capital that's in that market, which I think speaks to the resilience of the asset class. I don't know Kipp anything you'd add to that?\nKipp DeVeer: No, I don't think so. I think that's a really good summary, Mike. I mean Craig it's just the banks continue to lose market share and there continues to be increased acceptance, I think, of direct lenders, right? Just our market share in that market continues to go up.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thanks. No, very comprehensive. My follow-up is on ACOF V. The net IRR continues to rebound. It's in striking distance of the pref rate. Maybe you can remind us how the catch-up math will work as it crosses the pref rate and you could have a real large increase in future realized performances in the fund?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. Matt and Bennett are on. Maybe they want to talk about the -- what we're experiencing in that fund because it's generating some pretty extraordinary performance right now and then maybe Mike can help you out with the math, Craig.\nMatt Cwiertnia: Great. So this is Matt. Thanks for the question. ACOF V is seeing some nice increase in performance. I think we were up about 16% in the first quarter. We are seeing increases really in few different industries healthcare, which we have three different health care investments in ACOF V. Both are having strong underlying growth as well as good valuations in this market. Services where we have a couple of services investments that are both growing nicely even in the COVID environment as well as valuation. And we had some recovery in energy. Prices of energy have increased and we're seeing some increases in optimism in energy. So we feel good about the ACOF V portfolio. And we feel good about the continued hopefully increase in IRR I think in that portfolio as we see the continued underlying growth in each of those companies that we expect.\nMichael Arougheti: What's amazing Craig too ACOF V is a bright spot, but if you look at some of the older vintages ACOF I through V in the aggregate even with the energy exposures that composite was up about 40% over the last 12 months. Mike McFerran do you have -- do you want to talk about the catch-up and...\nMichael McFerran: Catch-up?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes.\nMichael McFerran: Yes. So what -- Craig once we clear the prefs there's a catch-up mechanism on the GPL piece split and then once you get past that. I'm going to call that let's say it's around a 9.6% IRR then you just have your 80-20 split. So it's a little disproportionate in between the two, but that's usually a short window.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Mike is it 20-80, kind of, the inverse in catch-up, or is it 100-0? I just forgot the math on that one.\nMichael McFerran: I don't have it in front of me. I'm going to go off memory and I think its 85-15 or 80-20 so the inverse to your point.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Got it. Thank you, guys.\nMichael McFerran: Sure. Thanks, Craig.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlex Blostein: Hi. Good morning or good afternoon actually guys. A question for you guys on capital management. Given your recent secondary offering and with AMP deal not happening, should we be thinking about the plans to retire the pref that you talked about earlier with cash on hand or with using \u2013 or with issuing potentially new pref or new debt? And I guess, bigger picture as you continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in the space, how should we think about your ability to sort of fund them with your current resources available as opposed to having to tap the equity markets again?\nMichael McFerran: Do you want me to start with that Mike or \u2013 \nMichael Arougheti: Yeah go for it.\nMichael McFerran: Sure. Hey, Alex. We \u2013 look I think with this equity raise, we are in a great position from a liquidity standpoint. We were in a strong position before, so it was very opportunistic for us. I think we're set up from a leverage standpoint and from a cash-on-hand standpoint that from a combination of closing Landmark, and as we mentioned on the call taking out the pref are both \u2013 we have the capital to do both, as well as support organic opportunities, and as Mike mentioned, potentially inorganic opportunities. If we were to tap any incremental capital, it would be opportunistic in the debt markets and that would just be a function of future opportunities and both from a capital market standpoint as well as things we're looking at. But I did not envision us thinking about being back in the equity markets for any time in the foreseeable future. I think we're well set up.\nAlex Blostein: Great. That's helpful. And then a couple of smaller questions here just around the private equity business. I was hoping you guys, could update us on the pace of fundraising for ACOF VI. And ultimately, when do you expect the fees to start coming in and sort of like kind of an implication for private equity management fees on the back of that?\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. I'm going to start, and Mike McFerran you could jump in also on the fees. So with ACOF VI, we stand at $4.3 billion and committed today in the fund. We expect in private equity we think about the business really overall in terms of our fundraising activities. We expect in the private equity business overall to raise about $5 billion of capital over the next 12 months. Specifically, for ACOF VI, we turned on fee in the fourth quarter last year, and so that is already starting to flow in 2021, and ultimately will have some increase here in 2021, as we get the final close and have some catch-ups relative to the ultimate fund SAS. Mike is that a fair kind of assessment?\nMichael McFerran: Yeah, I think it's spot on. And as you know, we \u2013 when you have subsequent closes of a committed capital fund, you'd also have a bit of those onetime catch-up fees that, you'll benefit from because new LPs will be paying country management fees back to the start date. So you have a little bit of some \u2013 when you have subsequent closes you can see pops off those, but then you'll just have run rate fees after that uncommitted.\nAlex Blostein: Yeah. That's what I was asking.\nBennett Rosenthal: Yeah. This is Bennett \u2013 this is Bennett. I would also highlight, we're off to a really great start with deployment with about $1.7 billion of that amount deployed already and committed.\nAlex Blostein: Got it. Yep, that all makes sense. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America.\nMike Carrier: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Just on FRE so expenses were on the lighter side this quarter. So Mike, is there anything unusual to note any change to the outlook or timing the targets just given that the FRE margin came in already at 38%? Obviously, you probably get some post-COVID expenses in the second half of the year but just any update there?\nMichael McFerran: Mike, just to clarify I couldn't hear you clearly. The first part of your question \u2013 the second part I get it on the margin and the COVID expenses. What was the first part of your question on FRE for the quarter? Did you say you felt lighter or \u2013 \nMike Carrier: I was just saying that the expenses were lighter, I mean, this quarter if there was anything unusual?\nMichael McFerran: Sorry. I was like...\nMike Carrier: Yeah, not FRE.\nMichael McFerran: FRE is 40% year-over-year. That didn't feel light. Yeah, G&A. Look G&A is usually \u2013 if I look at the average of the last four quarters, it runs on average around $42 million a quarter. This Q1 is a little lighter usually. Q4 usually runs a little heavier. I will say, it's a combination of there are some benefits and I'd say it's a couple of million still from reduced travel related to COVID. But at the same time, we're benefiting from scale. I think our team has done a great job on expense management. I know in the past, we've talked about how we opened up kind of an operational center of excellence in Mumbai year and half ago. That's given us some great operational synergies and cost leverage. But there was nothing unusual this quarter in G&A. It was more a matter of there was no kind of one-time or larger expenses on anything else on the capital raise front or whatever. But this quarter was \u2013 it was just kind of a clean run rate G&A number, again with a little bit of benefit from reduced travel.\nMike Carrier: Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up, just on performance income realized it's tough to gauge. But just given the strong performance you guys have been seeing the rising net accrued balance. Maybe if you can just update on like seasoning of the portfolio and the outlook in the current backdrop. And then if I can just squeeze it in. The legacy investments that you guys mentioned that drove the investment loss is that fully out? So should we expect that to kind of normalize going forward?\nMichael McFerran: Sure. Let me start with that one first. So, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, it was an old portfolio related to a small fund that we call an ACOF Asia fund. It's over a decade old. It's really down to its last handful of positions. A realization this quarter, the stuff's already been written down. We took a $12 million hit. As we sit here today or as of March 31, the remaining unrealized losses against that portfolio, if they were to be realized at those prices, would be $19 million that could come in over the next couple of years. I'm optimistic and hopeful, it's less than that. But if -- again, if we were to liquidate portfolio at marks, that would be the magnitude of what you're talking about. So, it's pretty small. And then, on the performance income, the $424.3 million one-third of that is an American-style waterfall funds, of which, almost all of it is past its respective investment periods. So that kind of sets up a really nice profile to Mike's comments in his prepared remarks about this is an attractive backdrop for monetizations. When I think about a substantial amount of the carry that's in funds that are, in the fact, what you would call harvesting mode is their past investment period. The other thing I'd want to highlight and I think you're aware of this, and it's going to become more evident in the years ahead, but I think the ACE-V closing is indicative of how it's going to continue is with over 40% of the carry -- our net accrued carry in credit funds. What you're seeing is we have this nice pipeline of accrued carry in funds really going back about three, four years, before there are kind of sequenced one after each other both in the US and Europe predominantly in direct lending, but then more recently the special opportunities and alternative credit. And what you're going to start seeing is a sequence of once those funds start kind of crossing over, triggering carry from the European waterfall, it\u2019s going to kind of be recurring and growing, because you had all these funds sequence after each other. And then again, with something like an ACE-V, those amounts want to grow and grow. So it's something I think we're looking forward to talking more about and putting some math around in the future. But I think what you're going to see with us, starting I think over the next couple of years, is kind of a differentiated carry profile where you're going to start having a bit of this kind of recurring carry that's not dependent upon actually exit the transactions, because it's coming off a credit book. And once it starts it should grow. So again, I think it's something that's going to be unique to our model, but I'll say this could be pretty neat and a lot more predictable from the realized income standpoint when it starts triggering on.\nMike Carrier: Great, thanks a lot.\nBennett Rosenthal: Hey, Mike, this is Bennett... Okay.\nMichael McFerran: Bennett is going to jump in.\nBennett Rosenthal: Yes. Just to jump in. I think look the environment for realizations right now from a PE perspective is as good as you can imagine with the financial buyer bid being incredibly strong, the IPO bid being incredibly strong, the SPAC bid, there's other alternative strategics buyers. So, I do think you're going to see us be considering opportunistic chances for realization across the portfolio. And they may not necessarily be full sale of monetizations, but we have lots of options in front of us and we're evaluating them at many of our portfolio companies at the moment.\nMike Carrier: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Beatty with UBS.\nAdam Beatty: Thanks and good afternoon. Just wanted to ask about sort of the Ares contribution in terms of seed or anchor capital for, particularly I guess the private equity fund given some of the recent raises. With the offering in the quarter, I wouldn't say you're constrained in any way. But just how much of a consideration is that use of capital for you as you launch new funds? Thanks.\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. Adam, it's Mike. I'll take that. I remind everybody that we are committed to running a balance sheet-light model. The uses for our capital are some of the strategic initiatives that we're active on and making commitments in support of existing and new funds. As a general rule, if you look across the portfolio, it tends to shake out to be about 1%. But what we have seen, I think we've talked about this before, is that as the firm is growing and as folks are here longer, the individuals are actually taking up a more significant portion of what historically would have been the GP commit. That comes with two benefits. One is obviously it reduces requirements for the use of the balance sheet. But two, it actually drives much better alignment with the private institutional or retail LP, which is actually supportive of the fundraising. And so, if you look at the growth of the balance sheet, what you're not seeing is the growth of the individual commitments alongside the balance sheet that is quite substantial at this point. And the last thing to remember, when we converted to a corp and we outlined our capital policy of a dividend pegged to our FRE growth with the reinvestment of our realized income into the balance sheet compounding at a low tax rate, that was with a view, that we should be able to support the balance sheet needs of our funds through the continued realization of the historical ones. So, it gets to a place where it becomes effectively self-financing as we scale.\nAdam Beatty: That's great, Mike. Thank you for walking through those dynamics. And then I just wanted to circle back on SMBC and the partnership there. I mean it seems like you're broadening and deepening relationships with existing LPs and also bringing on some new ones. And I'm assuming some of that or much of it maybe is product-driven, given some of the launches et cetera. But wanted to circle back on that relationship and just get your thoughts or comments or any color on how that's manifesting and helping drive the business. Thank you.\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. I'm glad you asked the question because a lot of times we \u2013 when there's so much going on here we talk about the strategic initiatives and we don't always get to go back and report on how they're going. That partnership over the last 15 years has been fantastic. Over the last 15 months it has really accelerated. We have found a number of opportunities to collaborate on, where they brought a very differentiated balance sheet to our platform. We are very active and hopefully we'll be in a position to talk about some new strategic product launches with them next quarter. But probably the biggest illustration of the type of relationship and value they bring, if you look at the recent equity raise that we did in support of the Landmark acquisition, paydown of the preferred and the strategic pipeline, SMBC stood up with $250 million in a side-by-side private placement in support of the company. So I think that was a pretty meaningful demonstration of the strength of the partnership but also how well it's going and how pleased I think we both are with the progress we're making.\nAdam Beatty: That's great. Multifaceted it sounds like. Thanks very much.\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. For sure. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.\nChris Harris: Thanks, guys. Are you able to talk to us about why the AMP deal didn't come together? It seemed like, obviously the conversations were far enough along and it was an asset you guys were really interested in.\nMichael Arougheti: Chris, it's hard for us to really comment in detail. We're subject to a confidentiality agreement. And as we've talked about on prior calls kind of a unique set of circumstances just around the ASX disclosure requirements versus our disclosure requirements, Australian media practices versus US. So I only highlight that because we've been pretty consistent in our disclosures. We did confirm and I'll confirm it here again that we were absolutely working in good faith to a potential transaction around all or parts of their private markets business and the AMP Board ultimately decided to go in a different direction. We may \u2013 we all may get the benefit over time of increased disclosures from their side as to how they landed in that decision but beyond that I can't really comment.\nChris Harris: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Lee with KBW.\nRobert Lee: Great. Thanks for taking my follow up. Mike I'm just curious. Some \u2013 obviously, some of your peers have no capital market-backed businesses. Some more recently have talked about it particularly stemming from their credit businesses and other way to grow fees. And I mean, I know ARCC generates structuring service fees and whatnot. But is that a potential business that you think there's more that you guys can do there or build out to kind of complement your management fees?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. I would say at the margin yes, Rob, we've talked about this before. We are very active in the capital markets but largely where we are active, we are effectively passing those economics on to the investors supporting those pools of capital. That's just a fundamental philosophical view that we have here. That being said, as our reach expands, as the investor base broadens, we have the capability here to monetize our relationships and our balance sheet differently than we have in the past. So I think that it could be an incremental revenue stream for us for sure but I would not expect to see us with a fully developed capital markets capability. It's just not the way that we're set up or the way that we think about delivering value to our end LPs.\nRobert Lee: Great. Thanks Mike.\nMichael Arougheti: Yeah.\nOperator: And our last question today comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Was just hoping, you could update us on your middle market cash flow lending business that is the non-sponsor finance business. Just in terms of where you guys are today and size some of the initiatives you have in place in terms of building out some of the origination efforts there.\nMichael Arougheti: Yeah. I'll give you a general view. And then, I'll let Kipp, chime in here. We take a pretty broad view to our private credit business. So if we're talking about middle market corporates, we've always had a meaningful business in the non-sponsored part of the market. The reality is the sponsored market is obviously a big driver of that, but we've seen an opportunity overtime to create teams that are focused on non-sponsored origination and execution as well as specific industry verticals. We've had good success. And we continue to grow in places like, direct-to-company ABL, through our commercial finance business. Our life sciences and health care industry teams are enjoying a lot of success direct-to-company. We have mentioned on prior calls, that we've stood up an effort in COVID around sports media and entertainment assets, that's largely direct-to-company. Our energy and infrastructure teams obviously lending direct to company, so that is a big part of the growth opportunity. But I would probably say, as big as those get, they're growing a pace with the sponsor business, not necessarily outpacing. In terms of the percentages, I'm going to throw out and Kipp, you correct me, if I'm wrong. It's probably in any given period 20% to 30% of the business, but obviously on a very large embedded capital base.\nKipp DeVeer: Yeah. I think that's right. I mean, Mike, all I'd add is right and you know this as well as I do, but just one other point. We really chose to dedicate resources, so we've been hiring dedicated to do direct-to-company lending. And we'll continue to, simply because when you take somebody in a region and they have some amount of throughput to do deals. And they have to choose between $500 million financing with a sponsor or a $30 million direct-to-company loan, they of course tend to prioritize the larger ones. So we -- finally after a lot of years of not wanting to staff that team differently, we finally chose a couple of years back to staff that team differently. And it's actually paying some real dividends for us. So I think we'll continue hiring there. And it will continue growing as a percentage of our mix.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to, Mike Arougheti for any closing remarks.\nMichael Arougheti: Thank you. Yeah. I would just close maybe with a summary of where I think we are, which is that the fundamentals in the company have never been stronger in terms of the setup of available capital, investment performance, the continued fundraising momentum that we have. So with the market backdrop that we're in, we are very excited about what 2021 holds for us. So we look forward to updating everybody on our progress in a couple of months.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our conference call for today.

            "name": "Michael Arougheti",
            "content": "Great. Thank you, Carl. Good afternoon everyone. I hope you are all healthy and wish you well. As the economy recovers on the backs of significant fiscal and monetary stimulus as well as progress on the healthcare front, we are off to a strong start this year across our business. Looking back at an unprecedented year of volatility and change, we believe that 2020 validated the resilience and durability of our business, the positive fundamental growth trends for our company, and the strong secular tailwinds driving the alternative asset management industry. As we look forward to the rest of 2021, we see a constructive market backdrop and continued momentum in the four core drivers of our business; strong fundraising, deployment, investment performance, and realizations. I'll speak to each of these specifically, but simply put, as we execute well on each of these fronts, we're confident in our ability to drive continued long-term value for our shareholders and to maintain our guidance of 15%-plus FRE growth for the foreseeable future. Thanks, Mike. We believe that Ares is well positioned today to take advantage of our strong competitive position and the favorable tailwinds in the global alternative asset landscape. Investors are allocating more capital into alternative investments, while at the same time looking to consolidate the relationships with broader scale managers. This plays to our strength as a broad solutions provider having also delivered time-tested and attractive returns to our clients. Over the past five years we've achieved tremendous growth in the wallet share with our existing clients as they invest larger amounts in subsequent funds and expand their investment exposures across the Ares platform. We believe that these trends will continue.  As a result across the alternative landscape, we'll look to continue growing our products, capabilities and geographical reach to provide additional differentiated investment solutions for our clients. Mike mentioned with over $40 billion of AUM not yet paying fees, we have strong near-term visibility for earnings growth. When you add in the growth avenues that we have in large and expanding addressable markets, we believe that Ares is well positioned to remain a high-growth firm for many years to come. I want to end our prepared remarks by simply expressing how impressed and grateful and proud I am of the hard work and dedication of our team. The amazing growth and investment performance that we've delivered is a direct result of our employees' strong commitment to collaborate and work as a team with a shared set of common values. I'm also deeply appreciative of our investors' continued support for our company. And I thank you for your time today.  And with that operator, I think we'll open up the line for questions. Sure. So we think about it a lot. I think the good news is we have a well-established brand in that channel already through the success of our listed vehicles in the form of ARCC, ACRE and ARDC. And we also have a pretty healthy track record of fundraising success and investment performance in the high net worth and ultra-high net worth segments of those systems as well. If you actually look at private banks over the last five years that's probably grown about 25% compound annual growth rate in terms of AUM in the channel. And high net worth has actually been our fastest-growing end segment with about 42% CAGR over the last five years. We're in that market with new product. I think we've talked about this on prior calls. We have a large and growing credit interval fund that's enjoying good success and performance. And our expectation is that we'll continue to put product through that channel over time. Yes. We've talked about this before and maybe just to zoom out quickly and I mentioned this in our prepared remarks, when we think about growth, we think it's important that we are driving high organic growth and supplementing that growth with M&A. And you can see how some of the organic growth initiatives in places like alternative credit and special opportunities European direct lending are all bearing fruit and accelerating. We also continue to drive growth into step-out strategies across the platform and that's the biggest driver of our sustained growth. When we execute on M&A it typically is going to be either to tuck in a capability or a set of relationships that we don't currently have where we feel that we can acquire it at an attractive price that's strategic. And when we're talking about larger deals like a Landmark or like an AMP it's with a view that there is a large addressable market that is growing where we have maybe a heightened sense of urgency to be in that market in scale. So SSG is a good example of that as well where we believe that the long-term growth trends in Asia warranted an acquisition to acquire capability, track record, broad office footprint, multi-asset class capability, investor relationships, et cetera. Candidly and I've said this before, now that the firm is a $200 billion of AUM and we're enjoying the success that we are, the product gaps if you will are pretty narrow. Secondaries was a big part of it for us and Landmark has filled that gap. We continue to think that the infrastructure market is an area that we should be focusing on both organically and inorganically. We are growing well in our core infra business, but feel that we want to globalize and scale that. And then in and around real estate as we've talked about before just given the size of those addressable markets globally, we believe that there is an opportunity for us to continue to expand our real estate group through acquisition as well. Thanks Robert. Sure. I can take a stab on that one. If you look at the composition of our dry powder today as Mike mentioned about $57 billion of available capital if you segmented that down to the AUM not yet earning fees, it's $40 billion, $34 billion of which sits within our global credit business. And for those of you who listened to the ARCC call yesterday, I think there was a pretty positive tone on the market backdrop for deployment. Obviously as the markets recover post-pandemic and liquidity in the markets persist, we just expect transaction activity to remain healthy if not elevated throughout the rest of the year. So as we sit here today, we had a very active Q1 on the heels of a very active Q4. And I remind people Q1 tends to be our seasonally slowest quarter for deployment so to see that deployment in Q1, I think is a really positive sign. I think the good news is that we're seeing deployment opportunities across the entirety of the platform. PE is very active. We're seeing transaction flow increasing there particularly as there's discussion about capital gains rate. So I think you should expect to see transaction activity increase. Real estate's active. So I'd say Gerry the good news is 15 months removed from the depths of the pandemic, the market's feeling pretty strong from a deployment standpoint. And I think that should translate in terms of the AUM not yet earning fees.\nGerry O'Hara: Great. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. Thanks Craig. Sure. And I'll address that and then Kipp is on the line too so if he has any color commentary, Kipp feel free to chime in. As we've talked about for now 20-plus years as the private credit markets have developed and we've solidified our leadership position, the moats simply put are origination advantages, i.e. more people in more offices with more local relationships. That sourcing engine at scale allows you to be much more selective in the deals that you do, which drives outperformance in credit. And I think that shines through when you look at our track record through cycles both in terms of the IRRs delivered but also the infinitesimal loss rates that we experienced. So order of magnitude in private credit, we have a close rate of about 3% to 5% of all the deals that come through the transom. And that origination engine drives credit performance. Scale of capital and flexibility of capital is also a pretty big advantage, which is why we're so pleased to see the scaling in Europe the way that we saw it in the U.S. The reason for that is you want to cover the broadest set of available market opportunities from the small end of the market to the large end of the market. And when you go through volatile markets like we went through in 2020, the ability to deliver certainty of close and flexibility of structure at scale is a pretty unique capability. And so you see us now in Europe doing what we've been doing in the US for years at the large end of the market which as Kipp talked about yesterday is actually offering some pretty compelling risk-adjusted return relative to the core middle market today. And then lastly, which is something that we're really enjoying and you really see the benefits of in a market like 2020 is just the value of incumbency. And year-in and year-out both in Europe and the US, we see that roughly 50% of our transaction flow in some cases north of that is coming from our existing portfolio as they're growing, deleveraging and releveraging, making acquisitions transitioning ownership. So when you build that big portfolio globally that we have the embedded value of being able to re-underwrite that portfolio and re-commit to it is a pretty big advantage. I think the competition it feels more competitive in the sense of the number of folks that have capital to deploy. But at the risk of sounding immodest I don't think that we're experiencing that increased liquidity as significantly more competition because of some of these competitive advantages that I talked about. In the European market in, particular, we have such a large advantage in terms of our capital base and the number of people that we have deployed against the market opportunity. We think that we've created some pretty significant white space between us and others in the market. The only other comment, I'd make to your question is in Europe, we're not seeing a meaningful impact on spreads and upfront fees from the amount of capital that's in that market, which I think speaks to the resilience of the asset class. I don't know Kipp anything you'd add to that? Yes. Matt and Bennett are on. Maybe they want to talk about the -- what we're experiencing in that fund because it's generating some pretty extraordinary performance right now and then maybe Mike can help you out with the math, Craig. What's amazing Craig too ACOF V is a bright spot, but if you look at some of the older vintages ACOF I through V in the aggregate even with the energy exposures that composite was up about 40% over the last 12 months. Mike McFerran do you have -- do you want to talk about the catch-up and... Yes. Yeah go for it. Sure. I'm going to start, and Mike McFerran you could jump in also on the fees. So with ACOF VI, we stand at $4.3 billion and committed today in the fund. We expect in private equity we think about the business really overall in terms of our fundraising activities. We expect in the private equity business overall to raise about $5 billion of capital over the next 12 months. Specifically, for ACOF VI, we turned on fee in the fourth quarter last year, and so that is already starting to flow in 2021, and ultimately will have some increase here in 2021, as we get the final close and have some catch-ups relative to the ultimate fund SAS. Mike is that a fair kind of assessment? Sure. Adam, it's Mike. I'll take that. I remind everybody that we are committed to running a balance sheet-light model. The uses for our capital are some of the strategic initiatives that we're active on and making commitments in support of existing and new funds. As a general rule, if you look across the portfolio, it tends to shake out to be about 1%. But what we have seen, I think we've talked about this before, is that as the firm is growing and as folks are here longer, the individuals are actually taking up a more significant portion of what historically would have been the GP commit. That comes with two benefits. One is obviously it reduces requirements for the use of the balance sheet. But two, it actually drives much better alignment with the private institutional or retail LP, which is actually supportive of the fundraising. And so, if you look at the growth of the balance sheet, what you're not seeing is the growth of the individual commitments alongside the balance sheet that is quite substantial at this point. And the last thing to remember, when we converted to a corp and we outlined our capital policy of a dividend pegged to our FRE growth with the reinvestment of our realized income into the balance sheet compounding at a low tax rate, that was with a view, that we should be able to support the balance sheet needs of our funds through the continued realization of the historical ones. So, it gets to a place where it becomes effectively self-financing as we scale. Sure. I'm glad you asked the question because a lot of times we \u2013 when there's so much going on here we talk about the strategic initiatives and we don't always get to go back and report on how they're going. That partnership over the last 15 years has been fantastic. Over the last 15 months it has really accelerated. We have found a number of opportunities to collaborate on, where they brought a very differentiated balance sheet to our platform. We are very active and hopefully we'll be in a position to talk about some new strategic product launches with them next quarter. But probably the biggest illustration of the type of relationship and value they bring, if you look at the recent equity raise that we did in support of the Landmark acquisition, paydown of the preferred and the strategic pipeline, SMBC stood up with $250 million in a side-by-side private placement in support of the company. So I think that was a pretty meaningful demonstration of the strength of the partnership but also how well it's going and how pleased I think we both are with the progress we're making. Yes. For sure. Thanks. Chris, it's hard for us to really comment in detail. We're subject to a confidentiality agreement. And as we've talked about on prior calls kind of a unique set of circumstances just around the ASX disclosure requirements versus our disclosure requirements, Australian media practices versus US. So I only highlight that because we've been pretty consistent in our disclosures. We did confirm and I'll confirm it here again that we were absolutely working in good faith to a potential transaction around all or parts of their private markets business and the AMP Board ultimately decided to go in a different direction. We may \u2013 we all may get the benefit over time of increased disclosures from their side as to how they landed in that decision but beyond that I can't really comment. Yes. I would say at the margin yes, Rob, we've talked about this before. We are very active in the capital markets but largely where we are active, we are effectively passing those economics on to the investors supporting those pools of capital. That's just a fundamental philosophical view that we have here. That being said, as our reach expands, as the investor base broadens, we have the capability here to monetize our relationships and our balance sheet differently than we have in the past. So I think that it could be an incremental revenue stream for us for sure but I would not expect to see us with a fully developed capital markets capability. It's just not the way that we're set up or the way that we think about delivering value to our end LPs. Yeah. Yeah. I'll give you a general view. And then, I'll let Kipp, chime in here. We take a pretty broad view to our private credit business. So if we're talking about middle market corporates, we've always had a meaningful business in the non-sponsored part of the market. The reality is the sponsored market is obviously a big driver of that, but we've seen an opportunity overtime to create teams that are focused on non-sponsored origination and execution as well as specific industry verticals. We've had good success. And we continue to grow in places like, direct-to-company ABL, through our commercial finance business. Our life sciences and health care industry teams are enjoying a lot of success direct-to-company. We have mentioned on prior calls, that we've stood up an effort in COVID around sports media and entertainment assets, that's largely direct-to-company. Our energy and infrastructure teams obviously lending direct to company, so that is a big part of the growth opportunity. But I would probably say, as big as those get, they're growing a pace with the sponsor business, not necessarily outpacing. In terms of the percentages, I'm going to throw out and Kipp, you correct me, if I'm wrong. It's probably in any given period 20% to 30% of the business, but obviously on a very large embedded capital base. Thank you. Yeah. I would just close maybe with a summary of where I think we are, which is that the fundamentals in the company have never been stronger in terms of the setup of available capital, investment performance, the continued fundraising momentum that we have. So with the market backdrop that we're in, we are very excited about what 2021 holds for us. So we look forward to updating everybody on our progress in a couple of months."

We are seeing increases really in few different industries healthcare, which we have three different health care investments in ACOF V. Both are having strong underlying growth as well as good valuations in this market. Services where we have a couple of services investments that are both growing nicely even in the COVID environment as well as valuation. And we had some recovery in energy. Prices of energy have increased and we're seeing some increases in optimism in energy. So we feel good about the ACOF V portfolio. And we feel good about the continued hopefully increase in IRR I think in that portfolio as we see the continued underlying growth in each of those companies that we expect."

            "name": "Michael McFerran",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Hello, everyone. I hope all of you are safe and well. I will start with a review of our strong first quarter results and our outlook for 2021. We continue to deliver across our core financial metrics with FRE, management fees, AUM, fee paying AUM and dry powder, all either at or near firm records. This performance is a testament to the resiliency of our firm despite the challenges presented in the last 12 months. Our fee-related earnings continues to grow quarter-over-quarter and this quarter's comparable FRE growth exceeded our expectations, as we are able to grow sequentially, despite an exceptionally strong fourth quarter of last year. For the first quarter, FRE totaled $128.5 million, an increase of 38% year-over-year compared to the first quarter of 2020. Our quarterly FRE margin reflects a firm record of 38.4%, nearly a 500 basis point improvement year-over-year, as we continue to deploy capital from our Shadow AUM, raise new capital and further scale our business lines. Of note, for the first quarter, our fee-related earnings comprise more than 90% of our realized income and for the last 12 months, FRE accounted for more than 75% of realized income. FRE for the first quarter was driven by management fees, totaling $327 million, an increase of approximately 20% over the first quarter of 2020. Turning to expenses. Our combined compensation and general and administrative expenses grew by approximately 11.5% compared to the first quarter of 2020. Realized income for the first quarter, totaled $137 million, up slightly year-over-year as most of our realizations came from a partial secondary sale in one of our private equity portfolio companies the AZEK Company. After-tax realized income per share of Class A common stock, net of preferred stock distributions was $0.46 per share for the first quarter, up from $0.45 in the first quarter of 2020. Catch-up? Yes. So what -- Craig once we clear the prefs there's a catch-up mechanism on the GPL piece split and then once you get past that. I'm going to call that let's say it's around a 9.6% IRR then you just have your 80-20 split. So it's a little disproportionate in between the two, but that's usually a short window. I don't have it in front of me. I'm going to go off memory and I think its 85-15 or 80-20 so the inverse to your point. Sure. Thanks, Craig. Do you want me to start with that Mike or \u2013 Sure. Hey, Alex. We \u2013 look I think with this equity raise, we are in a great position from a liquidity standpoint. We were in a strong position before, so it was very opportunistic for us. I think we're set up from a leverage standpoint and from a cash-on-hand standpoint that from a combination of closing Landmark, and as we mentioned on the call taking out the pref are both \u2013 we have the capital to do both, as well as support organic opportunities, and as Mike mentioned, potentially inorganic opportunities. If we were to tap any incremental capital, it would be opportunistic in the debt markets and that would just be a function of future opportunities and both from a capital market standpoint as well as things we're looking at. But I did not envision us thinking about being back in the equity markets for any time in the foreseeable future. I think we're well set up. Yeah, I think it's spot on. And as you know, we \u2013 when you have subsequent closes of a committed capital fund, you'd also have a bit of those onetime catch-up fees that, you'll benefit from because new LPs will be paying country management fees back to the start date. So you have a little bit of some \u2013 when you have subsequent closes you can see pops off those, but then you'll just have run rate fees after that uncommitted. Mike, just to clarify I couldn't hear you clearly. The first part of your question \u2013 the second part I get it on the margin and the COVID expenses. What was the first part of your question on FRE for the quarter? Did you say you felt lighter or \u2013 Sorry. I was like... FRE is 40% year-over-year. That didn't feel light. Yeah, G&A. Look G&A is usually \u2013 if I look at the average of the last four quarters, it runs on average around $42 million a quarter. This Q1 is a little lighter usually. Q4 usually runs a little heavier. I will say, it's a combination of there are some benefits and I'd say it's a couple of million still from reduced travel related to COVID. But at the same time, we're benefiting from scale. I think our team has done a great job on expense management. I know in the past, we've talked about how we opened up kind of an operational center of excellence in Mumbai year and half ago. That's given us some great operational synergies and cost leverage. But there was nothing unusual this quarter in G&A. It was more a matter of there was no kind of one-time or larger expenses on anything else on the capital raise front or whatever. But this quarter was \u2013 it was just kind of a clean run rate G&A number, again with a little bit of benefit from reduced travel. Sure. Let me start with that one first. So, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, it was an old portfolio related to a small fund that we call an ACOF Asia fund. It's over a decade old. It's really down to its last handful of positions. A realization this quarter, the stuff's already been written down. We took a $12 million hit. As we sit here today or as of March 31, the remaining unrealized losses against that portfolio, if they were to be realized at those prices, would be $19 million that could come in over the next couple of years. I'm optimistic and hopeful, it's less than that. But if -- again, if we were to liquidate portfolio at marks, that would be the magnitude of what you're talking about. So, it's pretty small. And then, on the performance income, the $424.3 million one-third of that is an American-style waterfall funds, of which, almost all of it is past its respective investment periods. So that kind of sets up a really nice profile to Mike's comments in his prepared remarks about this is an attractive backdrop for monetizations. When I think about a substantial amount of the carry that's in funds that are, in the fact, what you would call harvesting mode is their past investment period. The other thing I'd want to highlight and I think you're aware of this, and it's going to become more evident in the years ahead, but I think the ACE-V closing is indicative of how it's going to continue is with over 40% of the carry -- our net accrued carry in credit funds. What you're seeing is we have this nice pipeline of accrued carry in funds really going back about three, four years, before there are kind of sequenced one after each other both in the US and Europe predominantly in direct lending, but then more recently the special opportunities and alternative credit. And what you're going to start seeing is a sequence of once those funds start kind of crossing over, triggering carry from the European waterfall, it\u2019s going to kind of be recurring and growing, because you had all these funds sequence after each other. And then again, with something like an ACE-V, those amounts want to grow and grow. So it's something I think we're looking forward to talking more about and putting some math around in the future. But I think what you're going to see with us, starting I think over the next couple of years, is kind of a differentiated carry profile where you're going to start having a bit of this kind of recurring carry that's not dependent upon actually exit the transactions, because it's coming off a credit book. And once it starts it should grow. So again, I think it's something that's going to be unique to our model, but I'll say this could be pretty neat and a lot more predictable from the realized income standpoint when it starts triggering on. Bennett is going to jump in."

I mean Craig it's just the banks continue to lose market share and there continues to be increased acceptance, I think, of direct lenders, right? Just our market share in that market continues to go up. Yeah. I think that's right. I mean, Mike, all I'd add is right and you know this as well as I do, but just one other point. We really chose to dedicate resources, so we've been hiring dedicated to do direct-to-company lending. And we'll continue to, simply because when you take somebody in a region and they have some amount of throughput to do deals. And they have to choose between $500 million financing with a sponsor or a $30 million direct-to-company loan, they of course tend to prioritize the larger ones. So we -- finally after a lot of years of not wanting to staff that team differently, we finally chose a couple of years back to staff that team differently. And it's actually paying some real dividends for us. So I think we'll continue hiring there. And it will continue growing as a percentage of our mix."

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday February 9, 2023. I will now turn the call over to Carl Drake, Head of Public Markets Investor Relations at Ares Management. Please go ahead. \nCarl Drake: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter and year-end 2022 conference call. I'm joined today by Michael Arougheti, our Chief Executive Officer; and Jarrod Phillips, our Chief Financial Officer. We also have a number of executives with us today, who will be available during Q&A. Before we begin, I want to remind you that comments made during this call, contain forward-looking statements and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those identified in Risk Factors in our SEC filings. Our actual results could differ materially, and we undertake no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Please also note that past performance is not a guarantee of future results and nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Ares Fund. During this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which should not be considered in isolation from, or a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Please refer to our fourth quarter and full year earnings presentation available on the Investor Resources section of our website for reconciliations of the measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Note that, we will plan to file our Form 10-K later this month. This morning, we announced that we declared our first quarter common dividend of $0.77 per share of its Class A, and nonvoting common stock, representing an increase of 26% over our dividend for the same quarter a year ago. The dividend will be paid on March 31, 2023 to holders of record on March 17. Jarrod will provide additional color on the drivers of the significant increase in our quarterly dividend later in the call. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mike Arougheti, who will start with some quarterly and year-end financial and business highlights. \nMichael Arougheti: Thanks, Carl, and good afternoon. I hope everybody is doing well. Despite significant volatility and uncertainty in the markets throughout the year, we generated exceptional growth and strong performance across our financial and operational metrics. Year-over-year, we grew 32% in management fees, 40% in fee-related earnings, and 30% in after-tax realized income per Class A common share, while also delivering a strong year of fund performance for our investors. This financial outperformance during challenging markets isn't new to Ares, as our management fee-centric business model and flexible investing approach have enabled us to accelerate our growth during past turbulent market cycles and recessions. The strong relative performance of alternative investments last year, compared to the publicly traded equity and fixed income markets only further reinforces our belief in the benefits of private market investing. Investors remain significantly under allocated to alternatives, which represent just over 10% in total global AUM. With a robust fundraising pipeline and our expanded investment capabilities heading into 2023, we believe that we're well positioned for continued strong growth as we expect investors to increase their alternative allocations. While 2021 was a transformational year for our platform, with multiple strategic acquisitions, 2022 was a year of integration, and platform building to position the company for future growth. During the year, we added approximately 450 professionals with 150 in origination and investing, and 85 in fundraising and wealth management, including new senior wealth management heads in Europe and Asia Pacific. We also spent the year enhancing our retail platform through product expansion, growing our distribution capabilities and deepening relationships with strategic distribution partners. Our affiliated insurance business, Aspida began directly originating annuity contracts in late June and finished the year with significant growth and momentum. We also continue to expand our relationships with existing and new institutional investors and experienced a significant increase in our institutional strategic partnerships. For the year, we added over 100 new institutional investors, while seeing over 90% of inflows coming from existing investors either through reups or commitments to new products. At the end of 2022, nearly 90% of our AUM was from investors that held multiple funds managed by Ares. We ended the year with $352 billion in AUM, an increase of 15% from $305.8 billion at the end of 2021 driven primarily by fundraising of $57 billion, including more than $12 billion in the fourth quarter. Although, we didn't have many large commingled funds in the market last year, our fundraising benefited from a growing base of capital from non-campaign fund sources, including our perpetual funds, certain managed accounts and other smaller funds. To that point of the $57 billion of fundraising in 2022, over $40 billion was capital raised from outside of our 20 largest institutional commingled fund families. We also continue to innovate and offer new strategies to our investor base. For example, more than 40% of our fundraising last year was from new strategies or products that didn't exist five years ago at Ares. During the fourth quarter, we held notable fundraises, including a first close on our fourth US opportunistic real estate fund of more than $1.4 billion; and a final close on Infrastructure Debt Fund V, which reached approximately $5 billion of committed capital including related vehicles. We believe that our Infrastructure Debt Fund V is the largest infrastructure sub debt fund ever raised and is a testament to our leadership in that segment of the market. Also our non-traded BDC Ares raised $847 million of equity commitments in a private placement in November through January and closed on a $625 million leverage facility. While we experienced a slowdown of net inflows into our two non-traded REITs flows remain positive with a combined $440 million of gross quarterly proceeds inclusive of our 1031 exchange program versus $157 million of quarterly redemption requests. We believe that our all-weather careful investment approach, lower use of leverage and sticky capital within our 1031 exchange program benefits our fee-paying AUM. In addition, we're still growing the distribution capabilities around the non-trade REITs. In December, we added a second large wirehouse for distribution and we expect to add two or more wirehouses or private bank relationships for our suite of retail products in the first half of this year. We anticipate additional inflows from these new relationships over time, as we continue to ramp our sales efforts. We are firm believers that the long-term growth opportunity for alternative products in the retail channel will be robust. Retail investors are meaningfully under allocated to alternatives compared to some institutional investors and key allocators across the retail space are looking to meaningfully expand their exposure to alternatives. Over time, we intend to offer drawdown and evergreen style strategies across our primary asset classes suited for both mass affluent and high net worth investors. As you may recall, we didn't expect 2022 to be a record fundraising year for us without many of our largest fund families in the market. For 2023, driven by the recent launch of several of our largest commingled fund families, we believe our aggregate fundraising will be well in excess of last year's and will approach our record in 2021 of $77 billion. In the aggregate, we expect to have approximately 30 commingled and perpetual life funds in the market this year including seven of our 10 largest institutional commingled funds. We're observing a flight to larger higher quality managers as investors are consolidating their allocations with preferred managers. Not only does this scale benefit us in fundraising, but it could enhance our competitive advantages as other players have less capital to deploy. As an example, late last year, we launched our sixth European direct lending funds and most of the predecessor funds largest investors are working towards making a commitment in the first close. We expect to have a substantial first close in this fund in late Q1 or early Q2. We also recently launched our third US senior direct lending fund and expect to see similar demand for that fund as well with the first close slated for the second quarter. The total capital for the previous vintages for these two European and US direct lending funds was just over $30 billion combined including fund leverage. Additionally, the second vintage of our alternative credit fund is in the market and we anticipate a first close in late March or April. As a reminder, our alternative credit strategy deployed flexible capital, focused on large diversified portfolios of assets that generate contractual cash flows. The fund carries a unique performance fee structure where 10% of the carry, half from the investment team and half from Ares goes towards charitable initiatives tied to global education, fighting global hunger, and the Ares Charitable Foundation. Initial investor engagement has been very active across all three of these large private credit funds and we expect strong demand for all of these products. We recently launched fundraising for our seventh corporate private equity fund, which we believe is particularly well suited for the current volatile market environment due to the team's flexible approach and ability to invest in distressed for control investments in addition to traditional buyout transactions. Turning to deployment. Despite the lower overall transaction activity, our market share gains in private credit continued to drive strong aggregate investment activity across the platform. In Q4, we deployed $21.8 billion of capital, representing a 19% increase compared to the third quarter. On a full year basis, we deployed $79.8 billion, which was flat compared to the $79.7 billion we invested last year which we believe is pretty remarkable given the slowdown in overall deal activity year-over-year. This drove our fee paying AUM to $231.1 billion, a 23% increase compared to last year. We continue to see very attractive investment opportunities across our private credit funds with all-in yields and fees on first lien direct loans of 10% to 13% with good covenant packages. In opportunistic real estate equity where we just held the first closing in the fourth quarter, we're beginning to see a small number of investment opportunities come to market, driven by liquidity pressures. In our PE business, our special opportunities team has been active with over $650 million deployed in the quarter in a mix of rescue capital, enterprise value-enhancing transactions, and stressed or distressed public credit purchases. In our secondaries business, we're seeing a growing number of both LP- and GP-led opportunities as certain LPs seek liquidity and fund sponsors seek to accelerate liquidity into legacy fund vehicles. Overall, among our many strategies that can take advantage of constrained liquidity in the market, we're seeing more activity for our private capital solutions. Going forward, with nearly $85 billion of available capital and several large first closes for our large commingled products in the coming months, we expect to have a strong capital base to take advantage of the market opportunities for our clients. I mentioned earlier that our affiliated insurance platform is gaining momentum after launching the annuity origination business in June. In the second half of 2022, Aspida nearly doubled its AUM to $6 billion, up from $3.6 billion in June including an additional $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter. We're now building an attractive portfolio of assets without the issues associated with the legacy back book. As we seek to raise additional third-party capital, we expect to scale our affiliated insurance platform further in the coming years. Our portfolios are generally defensively positioned as we head into the New Year. With nearly 60% of our invested assets in floating rate credit, we continue to benefit from rising interest rates. And these assets are generally in the top half of the capital structure which further enhances our positioning. In our US and European direct lending portfolios, we continue to see solid fundamentals, low defaults and resilience in our credit metrics with weighted average loans to value at year-end of 46% and 49.5% respectively, as well as continued strong EBITDA trends with last 12 months' comparable growth of 9% for both the US and European portfolios. Our global real estate portfolio continues to see strong rental growth and high occupancy rates, with our highest conviction sectors of industrial and multifamily, which comprises approximately 77% of our gross assets. In addition, other adjacent high-conviction sectors such as single-family rental, self-storage and life science accounted for another 11% of gross assets. Our non-traded REIT, AREIT reported multifamily rent increases on new leases and renewals of 13.1% and 11.6% respectively. In our AI REIT industrial-only portfolio, 99% of our space is leased. And during the year over 10% of the portfolio issued new or renewed leases at an average increase of 47% growth above the comparable or previous lease rate. Our global real estate portfolio overall continues to be underweight in office with less than an 8% allocation across the global portfolio and most of our exposure in the US is in the real estate debt that's largely senior in the capital structure. Our private equity group's portfolios continue to perform with year-over-year EBITDA growth of 9% and are positioned in more defensive sectors like healthcare, business services and light industrials. We believe that the strong secular growth that we continue to experience across our business is ultimately a result of our strong and consistent performance. In 2022, nearly all of our strategy composite returns outperformed comparable public markets for the year. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Jarrod for comments on our financials and additional details on the performance of our funds. Jarrod? \nJarrod Phillips: Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin with a review of the fourth quarter and the full year. Then I'll provide an update on our outlook for 2023 and beyond. As Mike stated, we experienced strong growth in nearly every financial metric, including management fees, fee related earnings, realized income, AUM and FDAUM for both the fourth quarter and the full year when compared to the prior year. In 2022, as we've seen in past markets, Ares Management fee centric and FRE-rich business model delivered strong results despite the turbulent economic environment. Starting with our revenues, our management fees increased 23% for the fourth quarter and 32% for the full year, driven primarily by the strong deployment of our invested capital. Our management fee stability remains a key differentiator for our business model and enables us to better manage short and long-term market dislocations. As of year-end, 95% of our management fees were derived from either perpetual capital or long dated funds, which reduces the risk of significant redemptions even during severe market movements. Other fee income was approximately $25 million for the fourth quarter and was just shy of $95 million for 2022, up 11% and 90%, respectively. Other fee income was spread pretty evenly among capital structuring, origination and administrative fees and credit funds, development leasing and acquisition fees in real estate and retail distribution revenues. For the full year 2022, we generated $239.4 million of fee related performance revenues or FRPR compared to $137.9 million for the full year 2021. The strong contribution from FRPR in 2022, of which about 94% was recognized in the fourth quarter reflects $164.3 million in annually measured performance income from our two non-traded REITs and $71.5 million in performance income from nearly 30 perpetual life credit funds that are eligible for two silent fee payments. As a reminder, the large increase in the non-traded REIT FRPR was partially driven by the fact, we received 100% of the FRPR in 2022 versus only 50% in 2021 as we closed the acquisition of Black Creek on July 1, 2021. Our underlying base of funds have generated FRPR continues to expand as AUM and these funds increased more than 35% to $22.4 billion during 2022. Looking forward, the outlook for FRPR from our non-traded REITs is harder to predict compared to our credit funds. We think it's reasonable to expect growth in FRPR in our credit funds in 2023 due to trajectory of interest rates as we anticipate earning higher base rates and fee income above fixed real rates. Our real estate funds will require some modest depreciation to meet our hurdle rates. And, therefore, the related future FRPR is harder to estimate. As it relates to our FRE, our FRPR margin when considering the associated compensation expense was 37.6% in 2022. Our margin on FRPR should remain below 40% due to our contractual compensation structure of 60% paying to employees and some associated payroll taxes. While the lower margin on our FRPR negatively impacted our overall FRE margin in Q4, it was still very accretive to our FRE during the fourth quarter contributing $85 million to FRE with $64 million from real estate and $20 million from credit. For the fourth quarter, FRE totaled $335.7 million, an increase of 33% from the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by higher management fees and FRPR. For the year ended December 31, 2022, FRE totaled $994.4 million, an increase of approximately 40% from the prior year. FRE accounted for more than 87% of our realized income, up from approximately 80% in 2021 and 74% in 2022. Our FRE-rich earnings are a key differentiator for Ares and we believe they add consistency and predictability to our overall earnings. This can also be seen by our compound annual growth rate and FRE over the past three and five years of 42% and 36% respectively. Our FRE margin for the fourth quarter totaled 39.9% and 40% for the full year. Excluding FRPR, which has a lower margin due to the compensation and related taxes that I previously mentioned, our margin was 40.6% for the fourth quarter and 40.2% for the full year. We continue to be on track to achieve our goal of 45% run rate FRE margin by year-end 2025, even including the margin drag from FRPR. Regarding the pacing of our margin expansion towards our 45% target in 2025, we have now made many investments in front and back office personnel in preparation for the upcoming fundraising cycle. The higher staffing levels dampened our margin expansion in 2022 and the full year effect of these hires will carry over into 2023. As we raised and deployed capital from these large commingled funds, coupled with an expected slowdown in headcount growth, we expect to see margin growth resume in the back half of 2023 with a larger step-up in 2024 and 2025. Our realization activity increased in the fourth quarter, with realized net performance income totaling $91 million, an increase of 10% over the fourth quarter of 2021. Net performance income included $36 million from our credit group, largely from European waterfall distributions and incentive fees from our US and European direct lending funds. Our private equity group also realized $33 million of net performance income largely related to EU waterfall distributions from ASOF fund. Realized income for the fourth quarter totaled a record $418 million, up 23% from the fourth quarter of 2021. For the full year, realized income exceeded $1.1 billion, a 28% increase from 2021. After-tax realized income per share of Class A common stock was $1.21 for the fourth quarter, up 42% versus the fourth quarter of 2021. For the full year 2022 after-tax realized income of $3.35 per share of Class A stock was up 30% versus 2021 and exceeded our 2022 dividend of $2.44 by 37%. As of year-end, our AUM totaled $352 billion, compared to $341 billion for the third quarter and $306 billion as of year-end 2021. Our fee-paying AUM totaled $231.1 billion at year-end, an increase of 23% from year-end 2021. Our growth in fee-paying AUM was primarily driven by meaningful deployment across our US and EU direct lending special opportunities and alternative credit strategies, which pay management fees on invested capital. Looking forward to 2023, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of further volatility in the markets and continue growing our fee-paying AUM. Our available capital was $85 billion as of year-end, representing significant future earnings potential. We expect our dry powder will increase as we enter a period of accelerated fundraise. As a reminder, we earn most of our management fees upon deployment since the majority of our funds earn fees on invested capital. As a result, the prior vintages of these funds do not generally have step-downs on their management fees. We ended the year with $41.8 billion of AUM, not yet paying fees available for future deployment, which represents over $400 million in incremental potential future management fees. Our incentive eligible AUM increased by 11% from the end of 2021 to $204 billion. This amount $63.9 billion was un-invested at year-end. In the fourth quarter, our net accrued performance income stood at $832 million, a decline of $56 million from the previous quarter, due to $75 million of net realizations. Of this, $832 million of net accrued performance income at year-end approximately 65% was in European style waterfall funds. For the full year, our net accrued performance income increased by 3% versus the prior year. As we highlighted at our Investor Day, we have a substantially growing number of European style waterfall funds that accrued performance fees that pay the vast majority of their performance fees in the final years of the fund life. For example, European waterfall style funds, totaled nearly $100 billion of incentive eligible AUM at year-end. In 2022, we realized $114 million in net performance income from European waterfall style funds, which represented 79% of the total net realized performance income for the year. Importantly, we expect net performance income from European style funds to continue to account for the significant majority of our total net realized performance income in the years ahead. As we laid out at our Investor Day in 2021, we expect to see a continued increase in our European style funds as older release funds mature and enter harvest periods. Last quarter, we stated we had approximately $300 million in European style funds that were past their investment period, and expected approximately $40 million to be recognized in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, we actually recognized $67 million of performance income from European style funds. Now at year-end, due to the interest generating nature of many of these accounts above their hurdle rates, we still have more than $300 million in European style funds past their investment periods. We now expect net realized performance income from European style funds of approximately $100 million and $175 million in 2023 and 2024 respectively. Beyond 2024, we currently expect annual realized net performance income to continue to grow as some of our larger direct lending commingled funds raised over the past few years entered their harvest period. As an update since our Investor Day of August 2021, the expected aggregate future net realized income from European waterfall funds raised through year-end 2022 has increased by approximately $1 billion to about $2.5 billion. In terms of our American style funds monetizations will be market dependent and episodic, and depend on market conditions and other factors. We have approximately $250 million in accrued net performance income and American style funds past their investment periods. For the full year in 2022, our effective tax rate on our realized income was approximately 9%, assuming all operating group units were exchanged fully into common shares. For 2023, we would expect a slightly higher effective tax rate ranging from 10% to 15% on a fully-exchanged basis, with the range depending on the level of realization. As Mike touched on earlier, the growth in our AUM in part reflects our consistent long-term performance and 2022 was another strong year. In credit our US senior direct lending strategies generated gross returns of 1.9% for the quarter and 9.5% for the full year. Our publicly-traded BDC Ares Capital just reported record fourth quarter core earnings and had another strong year, generating a net return of 1.9% for the fourth quarter and 7.1% for the full year. Our junior direct lending strategies generated a gross return of minus 0.8% for the quarter and positive 2.5% for the year, with much a decline related to market-based adjustments particularly impacting the fixed rate securities in those portfolios. Our European direct lending strategies generated gross returns of 2% for the quarter and 10.5% for the year. All of these strategies have returned significantly in excess of the comparable liquid markets for the full year. Although, US real estate equity composite gross returns declined 6% for the quarter, but were up 11.3% for the year, and our European real estate equity funds gross returns declined 7% in the quarter, and declined 3.8% for the year, still significantly outperforming the public REIT indices. Despite strong fundamentals in the industrial and multifamily sectors, market values have broadly declined as higher interest rates have weighed on discount rates and exit multiples. Within our non-traded REITs, AREIT generated a 0.3% net return for the fourth quarter and a 12.7% return for the year and AI REIT generated a net return of 0.1% for the fourth quarter and 26.8% for the year. Our performance was supported by the strong rental growth and occupancy statistics that Mike referenced earlier. In private equity both of our strategies significantly outperformed the broader equity markets during the year. Our corporate private equity composite generated gross returns of 0.7% for the quarter and 4.3% for the full year. Our Special Opportunities Fund I generated a gross return of 3.9% for the quarter and 9.1% for the full year. Our secondary strategy reports returns on a one-quarter lag basis. Private equity secondaries generated gross returns of minus 5.6% for the quarter and minus 4.9% for the year. Real estate secondaries generated gross returns of minus 1.8% for the quarter and a positive 20.3% for the full year. At the beginning of the year, we look to set our quarterly dividend at a fixed level for the coming year. Based on the significant outperformance of our fee-related earnings relative to our dividends and our strong growth prospects, we've elected to increase our quarterly dividend to $0.77 per share of Class A and non-voting common stock, or $3.08 annual, a 26% increase from the $2.44 dividend per share in 2022, as Carl mentioned. We believe this new dividend level is appropriate based on our current level of FRE and our growth prospects from our significant dry powder for deployment our flexible strategy and large fundraising pipeline. Before I turn the call back to Mike, let me touch on our forward outlook. As you will recall, we gave the market long-term guidance for 2025 at our Investor Day in August of 2021, including a target of $500 billion and more in AUM a run rate FRE margin of 45%, FRE growth of 20% per year and growth in dividends per Class A share of 20% per year. Up to this point, I'm pleased to say we have meaningfully outperformed these expectations with over a 40% FRE CAGR from mid-2021 through the year-end 2022. As FRPR was not contemplated in our Investor Day, 20% per year FRE growth rate guidance, we would like to clarify that we expect a 20% or more annual growth in our FRE from 2022 through 2025 excluding FRPR from our non-traded REITs. We do expect to generate attractive levels of FRPR on a growing base of eligible funds, but the growth rate is naturally harder to predict. We remain on track to meet or exceed the other elements of our Investor Day guidance. I'll now turn the call back over to Mike for his concluding remarks. \nMichael Arougheti: Thanks, Jarrod. So we spent 2022 investing in talent and strengthening our front- and back-office teams to set us up for strong growth in the years ahead. We believe that we're now in a position to capitalize on these investments with a large fundraising cycle, a strengthened capability to invest across a greater segment of the addressable market and an enhanced global platform. Based on the foundation that's already been laid, we have good visibility into the next several years of growth. In addition, we're seeing strong synergies, earnings contributions and future earnings potential from our recent acquisitions that have us all very excited. Our ESG and DEI teams are executing at a higher level as we continue to focus on our impacted areas. Overall, our culture makes us a stronger workforce and better investors, as we strive to make a positive impact for our stakeholders and our communities. As it relates to potential new acquisitions, our recent transactions filled specific product gaps in areas that we identified as high-growth opportunities. We now have a broader platform to build businesses organically. And as a result, the bar for new M&A activity is naturally higher. That said, we'll continue to look for strategic add-on acquisitions and strong growth areas, where we can leverage our platform advantages and bring attractive investment products to our LPs. Just this week, we agreed to purchase the remaining 20% of Ares SSG's management business still owned by the original founders, with the closing subject to receipt of regulatory approvals. Our purchase of the remaining stake was contemplated in the original agreement but both parties mutually agreed to accelerate the timing. In connection with this almost entirely all stock transaction, we're planning to rebrand the business Ares Asia, and expect it will be our platform for continued growth in the Asia Pacific region. I'm proud and grateful to the incredibly hard work and dedication of our team and for all that they do every day to deliver for all of our stakeholders also deeply appreciative of our investors' continuing support for our company and I want to thank you for your time today. And with that operator, I think we're ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Hey, Mike. I hope, everybody is doing well?\nMichael Arougheti: All good here, Craig. Thanks.\nCraig Siegenthaler: So with US banks building up reserves and getting ready for a recession, we wanted to get an update on how Ares' private credit portfolio is prepared for a rise in corporate defaults. And also what have you seen in the fourth quarter in January in terms of early credit quality indicators across your portfolios? \nMichael Arougheti: Sure. I think Kipp's on, so I'll give you my view but I think the good news is given the size of ARCC and the fact that they just announced, it's a good indicator of the state of play within the existing portfolios and probably a broader proxy for what we're seeing across the private credit portfolios here at Ares. We announced that if you look at year-over-year EBITDA growth in that book and it was true for our European, it was about 9.1% LTM period-over-period. So while I think like many we're seeing slower growth, there's still good fundamental strength within that book. Two and we've talked about this on prior calls, a lot of these private credit assets both corporate and real assets are sitting higher up the balance sheet than in prior cycles and are benefiting from a significantly higher amount of equity subordination than we saw in the last two credit downturns. And so if you look at positioning in terms of loan to value, they're generally speaking in and around 45% loan to value. And the reason I mention that is I think a lot of the impact from rising rates ultimately will be borne by the equity as the discount rate changes, valuation shifts and then there's a value transfer from the equity to the debt. Needless to say as we've seen base rates go up close to 500 basis points, it does put strain on interest coverage. Interest coverage in the portfolios though given the low starting point is still at levels that make us comfortable and are consistent with where prior cycles were. So what makes us so unique Craig is we're seeing strong fundamental performance and the conversation about defaults right now is actually happening at a time when rates are going up. And earnings are not necessarily slowing, whereas, in prior cycles we've seen rates going down and earnings beginning to slow at a much faster pace. So from the private credit perspective, it's a really interesting situation because we're accumulating significant excess return ahead of a conversation about any potential defaults. To that point, I still believe that while we will see an increase in amendment activity and default activity, it should largely be beneficial to total return. And to put that in perspective if you look at where ARCC's non-accrual rates stood at the end of the year, they're about 1.7% on fair value, which is well-below historical averages. So pretty unique position in terms of performance, a lot of liquidity and dry powder on the platform to both defend existing exposures and play offense if need be, but I think a pretty interesting vintage across the Board for private credit. Kipp, I covered a lot there. I don't know if you wanted to add?\nKipp deVeer: I think you got most of it, Mike. Craig, the only other thing that we said on this call for the BDC yesterday was that we did see some modest increases in amendment activity through the fourth quarter and into the first and I'd expect that will continue throughout the year, but it\u2019s not a huge cause for concern from our standpoint. \nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Mike, Kipp for the comprehensive response there. Just as my follow-up, I know Ares likes to be opportunistic in recessions. And I think we'll always remember the ARCC acquisition of Allied in the financial crisis. But how should we think about opportunistic M&A at the holdco level? And then also at the BDC level, should a recession here transpire?\nMichael Arougheti: Yeah. Look I think we have a lot of experience being opportunistic on corporate M&A at the parent company within the publicly traded subsidiaries and within our portfolio. It's core to who we are as investors and managers. I would expect that those opportunities will present themselves given how liquidity constrained certain parts of the market are and certain competitors are. It's still a little early for that Craig, but needless to say to the extent that there are opportunistic chances for us to either acquire portfolios of assets or businesses at attractive entry points you should expect that we'll do \nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nAlex Blostein: Hi, good morning everybody or good afternoon. Thanks for the question. I was hoping we could start maybe with a question around Mike just kind of getting your pulse on opportunities for credit deployment. When we look at the fourth quarter you seem to have been very active in what was generally I think a fairly slow environment for new deal activity. So, maybe expand a little bit where you guys were more active. And more importantly looking into kind of what you're seeing so far in 2023 areas where you expect to be a little more active and a little less active in how active are the banks. So I'm assuming not a lot of activity from the banks. But are they starting to come back to the market a little bit more given the fact that the market backdrop has gotten a little bit more constructive? \nMichael Arougheti: Yes. Thanks for the question Alex. So, interesting we noted this in the prepared remarks, I was pleased to see that when we totaled everything up after what was a challenging year for markets generally that our deployment was right on par with what it was in 2021 and 2021 was obviously a different market backdrop just in terms of velocity of capital and transaction activity. And I think that that speaks to the breadth of the platform by geography, by asset class and it speaks to the ability of most of our funds to pivot opportunistically between liquid and illiquid markets and move around the balance sheet when the markets are transitioning. So, if you were to drill down into where the capital is being put to work, there was obviously a slight mix shift towards public markets as we were seeing. And we've talked about this before opportunities emerge in the public markets that were frankly more attractive than what we were self-originating in the private markets. As those markets start to come more in line with one another we were able to start to be more opportunistic on the private side of the house as well and that continues. So, look even in markets where you have lower transaction volumes given the competitive dynamic today, meaning challenged access to the public equity market challenged access in the loan and high-yield markets, lower bank liquidity, private market solutions are pretty important. Right now is the marginal liquidity provider. So, we're finding ample things to do irrespective of a lower M&A environment. When you look at ultimately pipeline development, I think we're not going to see M&A volumes at least in the private markets pick up to where they were until we all agree that we stabilized from a rate perspective. So, my own personal perspective as we get towards the end of the year and everyone has a general consensus view that the hiking cycle is over, I would expect that there's a fair amount of pent-up demand and we'll see the M&A machine turn back on. I'd also highlight obviously places like special opportunities where we closed our second fund last year has been, very active. Places like alternative credit, very active. Opportunistic real estate debt and equity, very active. So, a little bit of a mix shift but still really, really exciting investment opportunity. \nAlex Blostein: Great. Thanks for that. My second question Jarrod probably for you. I wanted to drill down a little bit into the 26% dividend growth that you announced this morning. Obviously, supported by a very robust outlook you guys have for fee-related earnings et cetera and all the things that sort of discussed already on the call. But is that a way of effectively seeing hey look FRE growth could be north of that and that's sort of what informs your confidence around raising it by as much, or do you partially incorporate the fact that European style waterfall contribution will continue to rise and those are FREs almost cash flows and that kind of what gives you confidence in going above the typical dividend increase that we've seen in the past? Thanks.\nJarrod Phillips: Thanks Alex. Look, it's a number of those factors all wrapped into one. First is, yes, we have a lot of conviction on our FRE growth as I mentioned in the script. We reiterated our guidance at the 20% per year growth. That's ex the FRPR are related to the REIT, because that's a little bit more difficult to predict. So we know that we have that strength. We also just came off of a very strong year where we easily covered the dividend for the year based on our FRE growth. And then, going into next year, as you mentioned, we continue to see a nice pipeline of the European style waterfalls coming in. So when you mix all those factors together we have a high degree of confidence that that's the appropriate dividend level for the year.\nAlex Blostein: Great. Thank you, both.\nOperator: Thank you.\nJarrod Phillips: Thanks, Alex.\nOperator: The next question today comes from the line of Benjamin Budish from Barclays. Please, go ahead. Your line is now open.\nBenjamin Budish: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I wanted to follow up on something Mike you said at the very beginning of the call. You said investors generally remain under-allocated to all with a little under 10% of global AUM. I'm just curious, how are your institutional clients sort of thinking about their allocations? I mean we've heard a lot from some of your peers about the denominator effect in private equity. Do they tend to think about credit separately? Is there a lot more room to run in private credit in particular? I'm just kind of curious how you're thinking about that.\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. I think, the good news is we're in market and have been in market, with good success with private credit, private equity and real assets funds. I would say, generally speaking, denominator effect is impacting, what I would call, regular way private equity strategies or growth equity the most. You also have a little bit of a numerator effect in the sense that private valuations are lagging public comps and so, I think, it's hitting both sides of that equation. Our private equity business is, obviously, positioned a little bit differently with SOF able to invest around the balance sheet in distressed and transitioning companies in industries. And our core buyout franchise, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, having the ability to invest in distressed for control in addition to traditional growth buyouts, which we think is a pretty unique setup. For private credit and there was an interesting article in the paper a couple of weeks ago, just talking about pension allocations, as an example, being just shy of 4% of allocations with a general commitment to see that doubling. And I would say that, that's probably true for most of the other institutional investor segments as well. So we are not seeing any reduced demand for private credit. And in many cases, we're actually seeing appetite increase. And I think the increased reflection, to your question, that people are going into the cycle under-allocated. Number two, it's easier to deploy in credit in a market like this and so, for folks who are looking to capture excess return in this vintage credit is an easier way to put money in the ground. And three, just to put it in perspective, if you look at, generally speaking, performing first lien senior secured credit across the private credit landscape, you're generating 10% to 13% rates of return, short duration floating rate. That's a really compelling place to be on a relative value basis, but it actually is liquidity-enhancing, because a lot of these institutional investors, whether they're pension funds or endowments or insurance companies are probably trying to beat a bogey of 6% on the low end and 8% on the high end. So if you're generating current short duration floating at 10 plus with rates still on the rise everything in excess of your hurdle is actually helping to refill the bucket of return that you gave up in your fixed income and equity book. So there's a lot at play here driving dollars into the private credit landscape and I would expect that to continue. \nBenjamin Budish: Great. That's really helpful. Maybe one quick follow-up. You mentioned the -- you acquired the rest of the Asia business. It's a smaller part of the whole. But could you kind of give us an update on the strategy there? What sort of contribution to growth are you expecting from there over the next several years? \nMichael Arougheti: Sure. Just to clarify we signed, but we're still waiting for regulatory approval. We decided to pull it forward really as an indication of the opportunity that we see there and just felt that by owning 100% versus 80% would give us just a better opportunity to align incentives along a shared vision for growth and really drive growth across the region under the unified Ares brand. So we're super excited about it. And this acceleration I think is a good indication of what we would see there. If you look at the businesses that exist today the legacy SSG businesses we bought was a leader in private credit in two fund families one being a distressed and special sits business, and the other being a more regular way senior lending business. And both of those families of funds have performed well and grown in our two years of ownership. We've been adding people and capabilities across the region. We've talked about on prior calls that we had a successful launch and closing of an Australian-New Zealand direct lending business. We have added senior folks in and around our real estate and infrastructure business. We've added secondaries professionals and raised capital to expand our secondaries business there. So I would say at a high level while a lot of those markets are still developing and don't necessarily offer the same scale of opportunity or breadth of opportunity that the U.S. and Europe do our vision for our APAC business is that at maturity it will be of a similar size as the US and European markets and all of our strategies will be represented there in each of the markets in the region. So it's going to take us a while to build that. And we're going to obviously need to see the markets mature and evolve from a capital formation and regulatory standpoint, but that's the vision. I think from a growth standpoint the good news is that they have been growing at a similar pace to the rest of the platform obviously off of a smaller base, but enjoying good growth and we'd expect that to continue. \nBenjamin Budish: Hey, great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. \nMichael Cyprys: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to circle back to some of the comments you made earlier about investments that you've been making in the platform over the past couple of years. I was hoping you could maybe elaborate on kind of where we are at this point. What's left in terms of the build-out? And then how we should think about that translating in terms of G&A and comp growth compared to the double-digit growth you guys put up here in 2022? How we should be thinking about that into 2023? Thank you. \nJarrod Phillips : Thanks, Mike. That one is... \nMichael Arougheti: Jarrod, you want to speak to that one? \nJarrod Phillips : Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Thanks, Mike. The first thing, I'd say is that, as we went into 2022, we did talk a little bit about how that was really a year of growth of the platform and integration across the platform. That resulted in about 450 net new hires on the platform through the year. Now as that happens throughout the year, you do have that headwind coming into 2023 of those 450 hires being paid for the full year. We still certainly expect to be hiring a little bit throughout this year, but likely not at the same pace that we've seen in the prior year, as we've integrated those folks brought them in and really need to assess and evaluate the capabilities and get our fundraising off the ground. So once that fundraising then is completed and we deploy it as you look into the back half of 2023, and into 2024 and 2025, what you'll start to see is that's when you'll see more significant margin expansion. So as we kind of guided at the beginning of last year, we thought that we would have a very moderate margin expansion in 2022. I'd say that, it still won't be at the pacing that maybe we had stated back in 2019, 2020 and 2023 because of the headwinds that we received from that full year of hiring. And then as we deploy, capital from this fundraising cycle into 2024 and 2025 that's when you'll see that margin expansion really accelerate towards that 45% plus that we talked about.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thanks for that. And just \u2013 I\u2019m sorry.\nJarrod Phillips: Yeah, I was saying, because you asked about G&A as well. So, about half of our G&A is headcount-related. So you see a very close correlation to G&A growth, as headcount grows. The other half is a little bit more episodic in terms of what events are occurring at what times, or where capital is needed across the platform in terms of investment. So when you're thinking about G&A, there is a pretty strong tie to our comp levels.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thanks for all the color there. And just a follow-up question on the European style funds and the performance fees that you expect. So we hear you on the $100 million and $175 million in 2023 and 2024. So I guess, what's required in order for those fees to come through? I imagine most of these are credit funds, so it's just the loans maturing in the portfolio and then those performance fees get crystallized upon maturity of the loans as opposed to selling an asset like a PE fund. Maybe you could just remind us on that? And then just, how do you think about the potential for variability either upside or downside to that guidance? The macro environment say is more challenging in every recession or off to the races in its new cycle? Thank you.\nJarrod Phillips: Sure. When you thinking about \u2013 think the portfolio you're thinking about exactly right that, the credit funds that are within there are much less episodic in nature. They are based on the duration of the underlying assets. Generally, those assets don't make it to the end of their life before they are refinanced. So that's what drives a lot of the payments within that balance and that's what makes it a lot more predictable. As those loans today yield above the hurdle rates, you're consistently building those amounts that you have on accrual. And as interest rates rise, as it's predominantly a floating rate portfolio, you do see the benefit of that. Now, there is a difference between the amount you'll actually realize in what's currently accrued today, what's currently accrued today does have some of the variability related to unrealized gain loss, which as you know as these loans mature they will mature at par and that full yield will come in. So there's a slight benefit that you get from that aspect of it. There's also a benefit that you'll get in future years that's not modeled into an accrued balance today of that increase in interest rate. So that's why you couldn't have a difference between what we've accrued on our books, and what we believe that we will recognize over that several year time period. We do believe that these balances are more predictable because of their credit nature. Now that being said, there are some private equity style funds in there that are from our Special Opportunities group and from our real estate group their European style, and are still more episodic as they get to the end of their life. But we generally know that those are later in their lives and we're starting to see monetizations come through on those already. So \u2013 but you're exactly right to think of it in terms of being credit-driven and therefore being more predictable in nature as well as there are benefits that we see in that portfolio from rising interest rates.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Gerry O'Hara from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nGerry O'Hara: Thanks and good afternoon. Just thematically, I think renewables and energy transition are a couple of topics that we're kind of increasingly hearing about and I guess cited as high-growth opportunities. So Mike, would be interested to kind of get your thoughts on how Ares is thinking about these end markets perhaps what you're hearing from client demand or sort of positioning from a portfolio or solution set.\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. Thanks for the question. I think you're spot on that energy transition and climate infrastructure are increasingly important topics across the landscape. I think the good news is we were early in identifying that transition as an opportunity. So as a reminder in our fifth infrastructure fund here which goes back now 2.5 vintages, we pivoted from more traditional energy infrastructure into renewables and renewable energy. And now in the rearview mirror when you look at that fund, about 60% of our deployment in that fifth fund wound up being in the energy transition and renewable power with appropriately high returns relative to traditional power players. That set us up to launch our first climate infrastructure fund, a couple of years ago. Candidly the fundraise took longer than I would have expected because I think we were a little early in recognizing the long-term secular trend there. Good news is it was well raised and well invested and we are now in the market with our second climate infrastructure fund and are actively raising that. And while it's not closed yet, I think given some of the demand for exposure to energy transition, we have confidence that it will be. Obviously, there's a lot of positive catalyst, particularly in the US market on the heels of the Inflation Reduction Act. That's also helping to bolster investor demand. Two, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we obviously made the acquisition of the AMP infrastructure lending business. That team and fund family has been fully-integrated into the platform. We had a successful close on IDF V at $5 billion. Last year that fund is well deployed. And while it invest broadly across the infrastructure spectrum, not surprisingly they too were benefiting from the increase in appetite for in transaction activity within energy transition. And then probably most recently, which we're super excited about is the announcement that we made out of our SPAC Ares Acquisition Corp., where we are entering into a transaction to merge with Ex Energy, which is a fourth generation small modular nuclear reactor business, which we think is really at the forefront and cutting edge of the future of the energy transition. So we're very focused on it. We have multiple products and avenues to invest behind it, and I would think that with continued good performance that that's going to continue to be a good growth area for us.\nGerry O'Hara: Great. Thanks for the reminder and update. That\u2019s it for me. Appreciate it.\nMichael Arougheti: Thanks Gerry.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nPatrick Davitt: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks. Most have been asked. Maybe could you speak a little bit how the wealth management flow experience has evolved since quarter end and if you're seeing any meaningful impact of the press noise, obviously, in that channel kind of late in the quarter?\nMichael Arougheti: Yeah. So the good news is these numbers get publicly released so you guys will be able to see how we're doing. I think the good news from our perspective is that we've been having a different experience than some of the larger peers. If you look at our wealth management platform right now, we have obviously our two non-traded REITs AI REIT and AREIT. We have our interval fund. We have our recently launched private markets fund and as we talked about our recently formed non-traded BDC. And if you look across all four, we've actually had positive flows. So to put that in perspective, if you look at inflows into the non-traded REITs, Q4 inflows were about $430 million against outflows about $157 million, so a healthy cushion. Just to contextualize it that $430 million was down from a little over $840 in Q3. So not surprisingly given, I think some of the noise in the channel but also just some of the market reaction to transitions in the real estate business. We've seen slower inflows, but we haven't seen a disproportionate amount of outflows and that's generally been the case throughout the course of the year. Going into 2023, still too early. But again as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, while our two REITs are quite substantial, aggregating about $13.5 billion in the aggregate, we're just growing off of a smaller base. That puts us in a position where we can continue to add distribution partners. And as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we fully expect that we'll be adding two new wirehouse partners for those products in the first half of this year. So some of the headwinds we're able to grow through just as we're adding new distribution relationships. And then we do have some unique elements to our business in terms of how we invest, but probably most importantly is we have a 1031 exchange program that feeds into both of our REITs that just promotes a stickier investor base if you will. So it's something we're watching closely. We are not slowing our investments in the channel. We're still very long-term believers in the growth in that market. And at least as we're experiencing it we've seen a modest slowdown in inflows, but we're not seeing net outflows.\nPatrick Davitt: Great. That's all I have got. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question today comes from the line of Adam Beatty from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nAdam Beatty: Hi. Thank you. Good afternoon. Just wanted to get an update on the secondaries business. I think last quarter there was a little bit of rebranding maybe some trunk A fundraising. Seems like an opportune time to be out in the market with something like that so I just wanted to get maybe some outlook on when you might be back in the market what kind of funds and maybe how -- what kind of magnitude we're looking at? Thank you.\nMichael Arougheti : Sure. So the update is you're right. We have fully integrated what was the landmark platform. We're very pleased with the way that the integration has grown. We have added a significant number of new people across the platform here in the US and Europe and as I mentioned earlier in Asia Pacific. What we have tried to build just to leverage the strengths that we have within the GP and LP community is kind of a broader set of secondary solutions across the different verticals. We have added a credit secondaries business, which we think really plays to the strength that we have in private credit. We have spun up our team and are actively raising capital there something we're super excited about. We are in the market with our next generation of infrastructure secondaries, which is a big growth area for us. We are currently in the market with our ninth real estate fund, which was a fund that was ready to launch when we acquired. And we did to your point close out our prior vintage of private equity, and we'll be coming back into the market at some point with kind of the Ares version of what that strategy is going to be going forward. We're also excited that we're able to leverage the momentum we have in the wealth management channel to launch the public markets fund, which is largely anchored by our secondaries capability. We're seeing good scaling there and we would expect that to continue to grow. So the business has been fully-integrated. I think, we've repositioned certain of the strategies into higher growth parts of the market. We've opened up growth opportunities in credit and Asia and Infra in a way that didn't exist prior to the acquisition and now we're executing. So we'll keep everybody abreast of the progress there but a lot to be excited about. \nAdam Beatty: Excellent. Thank you. And then just maybe a quick one on the performance of the real estate strategies in the quarter. Obviously the full year was quite good. The underlying fundamentals the lease re-ups that Mike talked about seem very good. But in the quarter maybe a little bit more of a negative mark than some might have expected. So just want to get a sense if there's any time lag or other dynamics that played through there and anything that might be ahead for 1Q? Thank you.\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. Look there's -- needless to say when you just think about real estate the impact of rising rates you have to just think about how interest rate increases correlate to changes in the cap rate and valuation environment and how increased rate challenges certain property sectors from a from a debt service standpoint. I think to your comment we are fortunate that close to 80% of our exposures are in multifamily and industrial and the fundamentals there have been very strong. And so even in a world where valuations may be coming in you're growing through them with an installed base of tenants that is continuing to drive pretty strong NOI at the property level. And I think that's kind of the way to think about it which is not all real estate is created equal. We're in gateway markets with great assets that are all performing really well. In terms of Q4 versus rest of the year, I would only read into that just the math of rates and not any kind of fundamental deterioration in performance. Because as you mentioned when you go drill down in terms of our re-up and re-leasing occupancy rates and what we're able to command given the assets we own the fundamental strength in the portfolio we think is pretty clear. I do think for what it's worth that the real estate markets are going to be one of the more challenging parts of the private market landscape. It's one of the reasons why we're so focused right now on our opportunistic real estate franchises just to make sure that we're appropriately capitalized to take advantage of the distress that should roll through certain parts of that market as rates continue to go up here. \nAdam Beatty: Got it. Make sense. Thanks very much, Mike.\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no additional questions waiting at this time. So I'd like to pass the conference call back over to Michael for any closing remarks. Please go ahead. \nMichael Arougheti: No we don't have any. We thank everybody for their time. Sorry, if we went a little late but we appreciate everybody tuning in and for the support and we look forward to giving everybody the update next quarter. Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Jarrod Phillips",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin with a review of the fourth quarter and the full year. Then I'll provide an update on our outlook for 2023 and beyond. As Mike stated, we experienced strong growth in nearly every financial metric, including management fees, fee related earnings, realized income, AUM and FDAUM for both the fourth quarter and the full year when compared to the prior year. In 2022, as we've seen in past markets, Ares Management fee centric and FRE-rich business model delivered strong results despite the turbulent economic environment. Starting with our revenues, our management fees increased 23% for the fourth quarter and 32% for the full year, driven primarily by the strong deployment of our invested capital. Our management fee stability remains a key differentiator for our business model and enables us to better manage short and long-term market dislocations. As of year-end, 95% of our management fees were derived from either perpetual capital or long dated funds, which reduces the risk of significant redemptions even during severe market movements. Other fee income was approximately $25 million for the fourth quarter and was just shy of $95 million for 2022, up 11% and 90%, respectively. Other fee income was spread pretty evenly among capital structuring, origination and administrative fees and credit funds, development leasing and acquisition fees in real estate and retail distribution revenues. For the full year 2022, we generated $239.4 million of fee related performance revenues or FRPR compared to $137.9 million for the full year 2021. The strong contribution from FRPR in 2022, of which about 94% was recognized in the fourth quarter reflects $164.3 million in annually measured performance income from our two non-traded REITs and $71.5 million in performance income from nearly 30 perpetual life credit funds that are eligible for two silent fee payments. As a reminder, the large increase in the non-traded REIT FRPR was partially driven by the fact, we received 100% of the FRPR in 2022 versus only 50% in 2021 as we closed the acquisition of Black Creek on July 1, 2021. Our underlying base of funds have generated FRPR continues to expand as AUM and these funds increased more than 35% to $22.4 billion during 2022. Looking forward, the outlook for FRPR from our non-traded REITs is harder to predict compared to our credit funds. We think it's reasonable to expect growth in FRPR in our credit funds in 2023 due to trajectory of interest rates as we anticipate earning higher base rates and fee income above fixed real rates. Our real estate funds will require some modest depreciation to meet our hurdle rates. And, therefore, the related future FRPR is harder to estimate. As it relates to our FRE, our FRPR margin when considering the associated compensation expense was 37.6% in 2022. Our margin on FRPR should remain below 40% due to our contractual compensation structure of 60% paying to employees and some associated payroll taxes. While the lower margin on our FRPR negatively impacted our overall FRE margin in Q4, it was still very accretive to our FRE during the fourth quarter contributing $85 million to FRE with $64 million from real estate and $20 million from credit. For the fourth quarter, FRE totaled $335.7 million, an increase of 33% from the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by higher management fees and FRPR. For the year ended December 31, 2022, FRE totaled $994.4 million, an increase of approximately 40% from the prior year. FRE accounted for more than 87% of our realized income, up from approximately 80% in 2021 and 74% in 2022. Our FRE-rich earnings are a key differentiator for Ares and we believe they add consistency and predictability to our overall earnings. This can also be seen by our compound annual growth rate and FRE over the past three and five years of 42% and 36% respectively. Our FRE margin for the fourth quarter totaled 39.9% and 40% for the full year. Excluding FRPR, which has a lower margin due to the compensation and related taxes that I previously mentioned, our margin was 40.6% for the fourth quarter and 40.2% for the full year. We continue to be on track to achieve our goal of 45% run rate FRE margin by year-end 2025, even including the margin drag from FRPR. Regarding the pacing of our margin expansion towards our 45% target in 2025, we have now made many investments in front and back office personnel in preparation for the upcoming fundraising cycle. The higher staffing levels dampened our margin expansion in 2022 and the full year effect of these hires will carry over into 2023. As we raised and deployed capital from these large commingled funds, coupled with an expected slowdown in headcount growth, we expect to see margin growth resume in the back half of 2023 with a larger step-up in 2024 and 2025. Our realization activity increased in the fourth quarter, with realized net performance income totaling $91 million, an increase of 10% over the fourth quarter of 2021. Net performance income included $36 million from our credit group, largely from European waterfall distributions and incentive fees from our US and European direct lending funds. Our private equity group also realized $33 million of net performance income largely related to EU waterfall distributions from ASOF fund. Realized income for the fourth quarter totaled a record $418 million, up 23% from the fourth quarter of 2021. For the full year, realized income exceeded $1.1 billion, a 28% increase from 2021. After-tax realized income per share of Class A common stock was $1.21 for the fourth quarter, up 42% versus the fourth quarter of 2021. For the full year 2022 after-tax realized income of $3.35 per share of Class A stock was up 30% versus 2021 and exceeded our 2022 dividend of $2.44 by 37%. As of year-end, our AUM totaled $352 billion, compared to $341 billion for the third quarter and $306 billion as of year-end 2021. Our fee-paying AUM totaled $231.1 billion at year-end, an increase of 23% from year-end 2021. Our growth in fee-paying AUM was primarily driven by meaningful deployment across our US and EU direct lending special opportunities and alternative credit strategies, which pay management fees on invested capital. Looking forward to 2023, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of further volatility in the markets and continue growing our fee-paying AUM. Our available capital was $85 billion as of year-end, representing significant future earnings potential. We expect our dry powder will increase as we enter a period of accelerated fundraise. As a reminder, we earn most of our management fees upon deployment since the majority of our funds earn fees on invested capital. As a result, the prior vintages of these funds do not generally have step-downs on their management fees. We ended the year with $41.8 billion of AUM, not yet paying fees available for future deployment, which represents over $400 million in incremental potential future management fees. Our incentive eligible AUM increased by 11% from the end of 2021 to $204 billion. This amount $63.9 billion was un-invested at year-end. In the fourth quarter, our net accrued performance income stood at $832 million, a decline of $56 million from the previous quarter, due to $75 million of net realizations. Of this, $832 million of net accrued performance income at year-end approximately 65% was in European style waterfall funds. For the full year, our net accrued performance income increased by 3% versus the prior year. As we highlighted at our Investor Day, we have a substantially growing number of European style waterfall funds that accrued performance fees that pay the vast majority of their performance fees in the final years of the fund life. For example, European waterfall style funds, totaled nearly $100 billion of incentive eligible AUM at year-end. In 2022, we realized $114 million in net performance income from European waterfall style funds, which represented 79% of the total net realized performance income for the year. Importantly, we expect net performance income from European style funds to continue to account for the significant majority of our total net realized performance income in the years ahead. As we laid out at our Investor Day in 2021, we expect to see a continued increase in our European style funds as older release funds mature and enter harvest periods. Last quarter, we stated we had approximately $300 million in European style funds that were past their investment period, and expected approximately $40 million to be recognized in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, we actually recognized $67 million of performance income from European style funds. Now at year-end, due to the interest generating nature of many of these accounts above their hurdle rates, we still have more than $300 million in European style funds past their investment periods. We now expect net realized performance income from European style funds of approximately $100 million and $175 million in 2023 and 2024 respectively. Beyond 2024, we currently expect annual realized net performance income to continue to grow as some of our larger direct lending commingled funds raised over the past few years entered their harvest period. As an update since our Investor Day of August 2021, the expected aggregate future net realized income from European waterfall funds raised through year-end 2022 has increased by approximately $1 billion to about $2.5 billion. In terms of our American style funds monetizations will be market dependent and episodic, and depend on market conditions and other factors. We have approximately $250 million in accrued net performance income and American style funds past their investment periods. For the full year in 2022, our effective tax rate on our realized income was approximately 9%, assuming all operating group units were exchanged fully into common shares. For 2023, we would expect a slightly higher effective tax rate ranging from 10% to 15% on a fully-exchanged basis, with the range depending on the level of realization. As Mike touched on earlier, the growth in our AUM in part reflects our consistent long-term performance and 2022 was another strong year. In credit our US senior direct lending strategies generated gross returns of 1.9% for the quarter and 9.5% for the full year. Our publicly-traded BDC Ares Capital just reported record fourth quarter core earnings and had another strong year, generating a net return of 1.9% for the fourth quarter and 7.1% for the full year. Our junior direct lending strategies generated a gross return of minus 0.8% for the quarter and positive 2.5% for the year, with much a decline related to market-based adjustments particularly impacting the fixed rate securities in those portfolios. Our European direct lending strategies generated gross returns of 2% for the quarter and 10.5% for the year. All of these strategies have returned significantly in excess of the comparable liquid markets for the full year. Although, US real estate equity composite gross returns declined 6% for the quarter, but were up 11.3% for the year, and our European real estate equity funds gross returns declined 7% in the quarter, and declined 3.8% for the year, still significantly outperforming the public REIT indices. Despite strong fundamentals in the industrial and multifamily sectors, market values have broadly declined as higher interest rates have weighed on discount rates and exit multiples. Within our non-traded REITs, AREIT generated a 0.3% net return for the fourth quarter and a 12.7% return for the year and AI REIT generated a net return of 0.1% for the fourth quarter and 26.8% for the year. Our performance was supported by the strong rental growth and occupancy statistics that Mike referenced earlier. In private equity both of our strategies significantly outperformed the broader equity markets during the year. Our corporate private equity composite generated gross returns of 0.7% for the quarter and 4.3% for the full year. Our Special Opportunities Fund I generated a gross return of 3.9% for the quarter and 9.1% for the full year. Our secondary strategy reports returns on a one-quarter lag basis. Private equity secondaries generated gross returns of minus 5.6% for the quarter and minus 4.9% for the year. Real estate secondaries generated gross returns of minus 1.8% for the quarter and a positive 20.3% for the full year. At the beginning of the year, we look to set our quarterly dividend at a fixed level for the coming year. Based on the significant outperformance of our fee-related earnings relative to our dividends and our strong growth prospects, we've elected to increase our quarterly dividend to $0.77 per share of Class A and non-voting common stock, or $3.08 annual, a 26% increase from the $2.44 dividend per share in 2022, as Carl mentioned. We believe this new dividend level is appropriate based on our current level of FRE and our growth prospects from our significant dry powder for deployment our flexible strategy and large fundraising pipeline. Before I turn the call back to Mike, let me touch on our forward outlook. As you will recall, we gave the market long-term guidance for 2025 at our Investor Day in August of 2021, including a target of $500 billion and more in AUM a run rate FRE margin of 45%, FRE growth of 20% per year and growth in dividends per Class A share of 20% per year. Up to this point, I'm pleased to say we have meaningfully outperformed these expectations with over a 40% FRE CAGR from mid-2021 through the year-end 2022. As FRPR was not contemplated in our Investor Day, 20% per year FRE growth rate guidance, we would like to clarify that we expect a 20% or more annual growth in our FRE from 2022 through 2025 excluding FRPR from our non-traded REITs. We do expect to generate attractive levels of FRPR on a growing base of eligible funds, but the growth rate is naturally harder to predict. We remain on track to meet or exceed the other elements of our Investor Day guidance. I'll now turn the call back over to Mike for his concluding remarks. Thanks Alex. Look, it's a number of those factors all wrapped into one. First is, yes, we have a lot of conviction on our FRE growth as I mentioned in the script. We reiterated our guidance at the 20% per year growth. That's ex the FRPR are related to the REIT, because that's a little bit more difficult to predict. So we know that we have that strength. We also just came off of a very strong year where we easily covered the dividend for the year based on our FRE growth. And then, going into next year, as you mentioned, we continue to see a nice pipeline of the European style waterfalls coming in. So when you mix all those factors together we have a high degree of confidence that that's the appropriate dividend level for the year. Thanks, Alex. Thanks, Mike. That one is... Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Thanks, Mike. The first thing, I'd say is that, as we went into 2022, we did talk a little bit about how that was really a year of growth of the platform and integration across the platform. That resulted in about 450 net new hires on the platform through the year. Now as that happens throughout the year, you do have that headwind coming into 2023 of those 450 hires being paid for the full year. We still certainly expect to be hiring a little bit throughout this year, but likely not at the same pace that we've seen in the prior year, as we've integrated those folks brought them in and really need to assess and evaluate the capabilities and get our fundraising off the ground. So once that fundraising then is completed and we deploy it as you look into the back half of 2023, and into 2024 and 2025, what you'll start to see is that's when you'll see more significant margin expansion. So as we kind of guided at the beginning of last year, we thought that we would have a very moderate margin expansion in 2022. I'd say that, it still won't be at the pacing that maybe we had stated back in 2019, 2020 and 2023 because of the headwinds that we received from that full year of hiring. And then as we deploy, capital from this fundraising cycle into 2024 and 2025 that's when you'll see that margin expansion really accelerate towards that 45% plus that we talked about. Yeah, I was saying, because you asked about G&A as well. So, about half of our G&A is headcount-related. So you see a very close correlation to G&A growth, as headcount grows. The other half is a little bit more episodic in terms of what events are occurring at what times, or where capital is needed across the platform in terms of investment. So when you're thinking about G&A, there is a pretty strong tie to our comp levels. Sure. When you thinking about \u2013 think the portfolio you're thinking about exactly right that, the credit funds that are within there are much less episodic in nature. They are based on the duration of the underlying assets. Generally, those assets don't make it to the end of their life before they are refinanced. So that's what drives a lot of the payments within that balance and that's what makes it a lot more predictable. As those loans today yield above the hurdle rates, you're consistently building those amounts that you have on accrual. And as interest rates rise, as it's predominantly a floating rate portfolio, you do see the benefit of that. Now, there is a difference between the amount you'll actually realize in what's currently accrued today, what's currently accrued today does have some of the variability related to unrealized gain loss, which as you know as these loans mature they will mature at par and that full yield will come in. So there's a slight benefit that you get from that aspect of it. There's also a benefit that you'll get in future years that's not modeled into an accrued balance today of that increase in interest rate. So that's why you couldn't have a difference between what we've accrued on our books, and what we believe that we will recognize over that several year time period. We do believe that these balances are more predictable because of their credit nature. Now that being said, there are some private equity style funds in there that are from our Special Opportunities group and from our real estate group their European style, and are still more episodic as they get to the end of their life. But we generally know that those are later in their lives and we're starting to see monetizations come through on those already. So \u2013 but you're exactly right to think of it in terms of being credit-driven and therefore being more predictable in nature as well as there are benefits that we see in that portfolio from rising interest rates."

            "content": "Thanks, Carl, and good afternoon. I hope everybody is doing well. Despite significant volatility and uncertainty in the markets throughout the year, we generated exceptional growth and strong performance across our financial and operational metrics. Year-over-year, we grew 32% in management fees, 40% in fee-related earnings, and 30% in after-tax realized income per Class A common share, while also delivering a strong year of fund performance for our investors. This financial outperformance during challenging markets isn't new to Ares, as our management fee-centric business model and flexible investing approach have enabled us to accelerate our growth during past turbulent market cycles and recessions. The strong relative performance of alternative investments last year, compared to the publicly traded equity and fixed income markets only further reinforces our belief in the benefits of private market investing. Investors remain significantly under allocated to alternatives, which represent just over 10% in total global AUM. With a robust fundraising pipeline and our expanded investment capabilities heading into 2023, we believe that we're well positioned for continued strong growth as we expect investors to increase their alternative allocations. While 2021 was a transformational year for our platform, with multiple strategic acquisitions, 2022 was a year of integration, and platform building to position the company for future growth. During the year, we added approximately 450 professionals with 150 in origination and investing, and 85 in fundraising and wealth management, including new senior wealth management heads in Europe and Asia Pacific. We also spent the year enhancing our retail platform through product expansion, growing our distribution capabilities and deepening relationships with strategic distribution partners. Our affiliated insurance business, Aspida began directly originating annuity contracts in late June and finished the year with significant growth and momentum. We also continue to expand our relationships with existing and new institutional investors and experienced a significant increase in our institutional strategic partnerships. For the year, we added over 100 new institutional investors, while seeing over 90% of inflows coming from existing investors either through reups or commitments to new products. At the end of 2022, nearly 90% of our AUM was from investors that held multiple funds managed by Ares. We ended the year with $352 billion in AUM, an increase of 15% from $305.8 billion at the end of 2021 driven primarily by fundraising of $57 billion, including more than $12 billion in the fourth quarter. Although, we didn't have many large commingled funds in the market last year, our fundraising benefited from a growing base of capital from non-campaign fund sources, including our perpetual funds, certain managed accounts and other smaller funds. To that point of the $57 billion of fundraising in 2022, over $40 billion was capital raised from outside of our 20 largest institutional commingled fund families. We also continue to innovate and offer new strategies to our investor base. For example, more than 40% of our fundraising last year was from new strategies or products that didn't exist five years ago at Ares. During the fourth quarter, we held notable fundraises, including a first close on our fourth US opportunistic real estate fund of more than $1.4 billion; and a final close on Infrastructure Debt Fund V, which reached approximately $5 billion of committed capital including related vehicles. We believe that our Infrastructure Debt Fund V is the largest infrastructure sub debt fund ever raised and is a testament to our leadership in that segment of the market. Also our non-traded BDC Ares raised $847 million of equity commitments in a private placement in November through January and closed on a $625 million leverage facility. While we experienced a slowdown of net inflows into our two non-traded REITs flows remain positive with a combined $440 million of gross quarterly proceeds inclusive of our 1031 exchange program versus $157 million of quarterly redemption requests. We believe that our all-weather careful investment approach, lower use of leverage and sticky capital within our 1031 exchange program benefits our fee-paying AUM. In addition, we're still growing the distribution capabilities around the non-trade REITs. In December, we added a second large wirehouse for distribution and we expect to add two or more wirehouses or private bank relationships for our suite of retail products in the first half of this year. We anticipate additional inflows from these new relationships over time, as we continue to ramp our sales efforts. We are firm believers that the long-term growth opportunity for alternative products in the retail channel will be robust. Retail investors are meaningfully under allocated to alternatives compared to some institutional investors and key allocators across the retail space are looking to meaningfully expand their exposure to alternatives. Over time, we intend to offer drawdown and evergreen style strategies across our primary asset classes suited for both mass affluent and high net worth investors. As you may recall, we didn't expect 2022 to be a record fundraising year for us without many of our largest fund families in the market. For 2023, driven by the recent launch of several of our largest commingled fund families, we believe our aggregate fundraising will be well in excess of last year's and will approach our record in 2021 of $77 billion. In the aggregate, we expect to have approximately 30 commingled and perpetual life funds in the market this year including seven of our 10 largest institutional commingled funds. We're observing a flight to larger higher quality managers as investors are consolidating their allocations with preferred managers. Not only does this scale benefit us in fundraising, but it could enhance our competitive advantages as other players have less capital to deploy. As an example, late last year, we launched our sixth European direct lending funds and most of the predecessor funds largest investors are working towards making a commitment in the first close. We expect to have a substantial first close in this fund in late Q1 or early Q2. We also recently launched our third US senior direct lending fund and expect to see similar demand for that fund as well with the first close slated for the second quarter. The total capital for the previous vintages for these two European and US direct lending funds was just over $30 billion combined including fund leverage. Additionally, the second vintage of our alternative credit fund is in the market and we anticipate a first close in late March or April. As a reminder, our alternative credit strategy deployed flexible capital, focused on large diversified portfolios of assets that generate contractual cash flows. The fund carries a unique performance fee structure where 10% of the carry, half from the investment team and half from Ares goes towards charitable initiatives tied to global education, fighting global hunger, and the Ares Charitable Foundation. Initial investor engagement has been very active across all three of these large private credit funds and we expect strong demand for all of these products. We recently launched fundraising for our seventh corporate private equity fund, which we believe is particularly well suited for the current volatile market environment due to the team's flexible approach and ability to invest in distressed for control investments in addition to traditional buyout transactions. Turning to deployment. Despite the lower overall transaction activity, our market share gains in private credit continued to drive strong aggregate investment activity across the platform. In Q4, we deployed $21.8 billion of capital, representing a 19% increase compared to the third quarter. On a full year basis, we deployed $79.8 billion, which was flat compared to the $79.7 billion we invested last year which we believe is pretty remarkable given the slowdown in overall deal activity year-over-year. This drove our fee paying AUM to $231.1 billion, a 23% increase compared to last year. We continue to see very attractive investment opportunities across our private credit funds with all-in yields and fees on first lien direct loans of 10% to 13% with good covenant packages. In opportunistic real estate equity where we just held the first closing in the fourth quarter, we're beginning to see a small number of investment opportunities come to market, driven by liquidity pressures. In our PE business, our special opportunities team has been active with over $650 million deployed in the quarter in a mix of rescue capital, enterprise value-enhancing transactions, and stressed or distressed public credit purchases. In our secondaries business, we're seeing a growing number of both LP- and GP-led opportunities as certain LPs seek liquidity and fund sponsors seek to accelerate liquidity into legacy fund vehicles. Overall, among our many strategies that can take advantage of constrained liquidity in the market, we're seeing more activity for our private capital solutions. Going forward, with nearly $85 billion of available capital and several large first closes for our large commingled products in the coming months, we expect to have a strong capital base to take advantage of the market opportunities for our clients. I mentioned earlier that our affiliated insurance platform is gaining momentum after launching the annuity origination business in June. In the second half of 2022, Aspida nearly doubled its AUM to $6 billion, up from $3.6 billion in June including an additional $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter. We're now building an attractive portfolio of assets without the issues associated with the legacy back book. As we seek to raise additional third-party capital, we expect to scale our affiliated insurance platform further in the coming years. Our portfolios are generally defensively positioned as we head into the New Year. With nearly 60% of our invested assets in floating rate credit, we continue to benefit from rising interest rates. And these assets are generally in the top half of the capital structure which further enhances our positioning. In our US and European direct lending portfolios, we continue to see solid fundamentals, low defaults and resilience in our credit metrics with weighted average loans to value at year-end of 46% and 49.5% respectively, as well as continued strong EBITDA trends with last 12 months' comparable growth of 9% for both the US and European portfolios. Our global real estate portfolio continues to see strong rental growth and high occupancy rates, with our highest conviction sectors of industrial and multifamily, which comprises approximately 77% of our gross assets. In addition, other adjacent high-conviction sectors such as single-family rental, self-storage and life science accounted for another 11% of gross assets. Our non-traded REIT, AREIT reported multifamily rent increases on new leases and renewals of 13.1% and 11.6% respectively. In our AI REIT industrial-only portfolio, 99% of our space is leased. And during the year over 10% of the portfolio issued new or renewed leases at an average increase of 47% growth above the comparable or previous lease rate. Our global real estate portfolio overall continues to be underweight in office with less than an 8% allocation across the global portfolio and most of our exposure in the US is in the real estate debt that's largely senior in the capital structure. Our private equity group's portfolios continue to perform with year-over-year EBITDA growth of 9% and are positioned in more defensive sectors like healthcare, business services and light industrials. We believe that the strong secular growth that we continue to experience across our business is ultimately a result of our strong and consistent performance. In 2022, nearly all of our strategy composite returns outperformed comparable public markets for the year. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Jarrod for comments on our financials and additional details on the performance of our funds. Jarrod? Thanks, Jarrod. So we spent 2022 investing in talent and strengthening our front- and back-office teams to set us up for strong growth in the years ahead. We believe that we're now in a position to capitalize on these investments with a large fundraising cycle, a strengthened capability to invest across a greater segment of the addressable market and an enhanced global platform. Based on the foundation that's already been laid, we have good visibility into the next several years of growth. In addition, we're seeing strong synergies, earnings contributions and future earnings potential from our recent acquisitions that have us all very excited. Our ESG and DEI teams are executing at a higher level as we continue to focus on our impacted areas. Overall, our culture makes us a stronger workforce and better investors, as we strive to make a positive impact for our stakeholders and our communities. As it relates to potential new acquisitions, our recent transactions filled specific product gaps in areas that we identified as high-growth opportunities. We now have a broader platform to build businesses organically. And as a result, the bar for new M&A activity is naturally higher. That said, we'll continue to look for strategic add-on acquisitions and strong growth areas, where we can leverage our platform advantages and bring attractive investment products to our LPs. Just this week, we agreed to purchase the remaining 20% of Ares SSG's management business still owned by the original founders, with the closing subject to receipt of regulatory approvals. Our purchase of the remaining stake was contemplated in the original agreement but both parties mutually agreed to accelerate the timing. In connection with this almost entirely all stock transaction, we're planning to rebrand the business Ares Asia, and expect it will be our platform for continued growth in the Asia Pacific region. I'm proud and grateful to the incredibly hard work and dedication of our team and for all that they do every day to deliver for all of our stakeholders also deeply appreciative of our investors' continuing support for our company and I want to thank you for your time today. And with that operator, I think we're ready to open the line for questions. All good here, Craig. Thanks. Sure. I think Kipp's on, so I'll give you my view but I think the good news is given the size of ARCC and the fact that they just announced, it's a good indicator of the state of play within the existing portfolios and probably a broader proxy for what we're seeing across the private credit portfolios here at Ares. We announced that if you look at year-over-year EBITDA growth in that book and it was true for our European, it was about 9.1% LTM period-over-period. So while I think like many we're seeing slower growth, there's still good fundamental strength within that book. Two and we've talked about this on prior calls, a lot of these private credit assets both corporate and real assets are sitting higher up the balance sheet than in prior cycles and are benefiting from a significantly higher amount of equity subordination than we saw in the last two credit downturns. And so if you look at positioning in terms of loan to value, they're generally speaking in and around 45% loan to value. And the reason I mention that is I think a lot of the impact from rising rates ultimately will be borne by the equity as the discount rate changes, valuation shifts and then there's a value transfer from the equity to the debt. Needless to say as we've seen base rates go up close to 500 basis points, it does put strain on interest coverage. Interest coverage in the portfolios though given the low starting point is still at levels that make us comfortable and are consistent with where prior cycles were. So what makes us so unique Craig is we're seeing strong fundamental performance and the conversation about defaults right now is actually happening at a time when rates are going up. And earnings are not necessarily slowing, whereas, in prior cycles we've seen rates going down and earnings beginning to slow at a much faster pace. So from the private credit perspective, it's a really interesting situation because we're accumulating significant excess return ahead of a conversation about any potential defaults. To that point, I still believe that while we will see an increase in amendment activity and default activity, it should largely be beneficial to total return. And to put that in perspective if you look at where ARCC's non-accrual rates stood at the end of the year, they're about 1.7% on fair value, which is well-below historical averages. So pretty unique position in terms of performance, a lot of liquidity and dry powder on the platform to both defend existing exposures and play offense if need be, but I think a pretty interesting vintage across the Board for private credit. Kipp, I covered a lot there. I don't know if you wanted to add? Yeah. Look I think we have a lot of experience being opportunistic on corporate M&A at the parent company within the publicly traded subsidiaries and within our portfolio. It's core to who we are as investors and managers. I would expect that those opportunities will present themselves given how liquidity constrained certain parts of the market are and certain competitors are. It's still a little early for that Craig, but needless to say to the extent that there are opportunistic chances for us to either acquire portfolios of assets or businesses at attractive entry points you should expect that we'll do Yes. Thanks for the question Alex. So, interesting we noted this in the prepared remarks, I was pleased to see that when we totaled everything up after what was a challenging year for markets generally that our deployment was right on par with what it was in 2021 and 2021 was obviously a different market backdrop just in terms of velocity of capital and transaction activity. And I think that that speaks to the breadth of the platform by geography, by asset class and it speaks to the ability of most of our funds to pivot opportunistically between liquid and illiquid markets and move around the balance sheet when the markets are transitioning. So, if you were to drill down into where the capital is being put to work, there was obviously a slight mix shift towards public markets as we were seeing. And we've talked about this before opportunities emerge in the public markets that were frankly more attractive than what we were self-originating in the private markets. As those markets start to come more in line with one another we were able to start to be more opportunistic on the private side of the house as well and that continues. So, look even in markets where you have lower transaction volumes given the competitive dynamic today, meaning challenged access to the public equity market challenged access in the loan and high-yield markets, lower bank liquidity, private market solutions are pretty important. Right now is the marginal liquidity provider. So, we're finding ample things to do irrespective of a lower M&A environment. When you look at ultimately pipeline development, I think we're not going to see M&A volumes at least in the private markets pick up to where they were until we all agree that we stabilized from a rate perspective. So, my own personal perspective as we get towards the end of the year and everyone has a general consensus view that the hiking cycle is over, I would expect that there's a fair amount of pent-up demand and we'll see the M&A machine turn back on. I'd also highlight obviously places like special opportunities where we closed our second fund last year has been, very active. Places like alternative credit, very active. Opportunistic real estate debt and equity, very active. So, a little bit of a mix shift but still really, really exciting investment opportunity. Yes. I think, the good news is we're in market and have been in market, with good success with private credit, private equity and real assets funds. I would say, generally speaking, denominator effect is impacting, what I would call, regular way private equity strategies or growth equity the most. You also have a little bit of a numerator effect in the sense that private valuations are lagging public comps and so, I think, it's hitting both sides of that equation. Our private equity business is, obviously, positioned a little bit differently with SOF able to invest around the balance sheet in distressed and transitioning companies in industries. And our core buyout franchise, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, having the ability to invest in distressed for control in addition to traditional growth buyouts, which we think is a pretty unique setup. For private credit and there was an interesting article in the paper a couple of weeks ago, just talking about pension allocations, as an example, being just shy of 4% of allocations with a general commitment to see that doubling. And I would say that, that's probably true for most of the other institutional investor segments as well. So we are not seeing any reduced demand for private credit. And in many cases, we're actually seeing appetite increase. And I think the increased reflection, to your question, that people are going into the cycle under-allocated. Number two, it's easier to deploy in credit in a market like this and so, for folks who are looking to capture excess return in this vintage credit is an easier way to put money in the ground. And three, just to put it in perspective, if you look at, generally speaking, performing first lien senior secured credit across the private credit landscape, you're generating 10% to 13% rates of return, short duration floating rate. That's a really compelling place to be on a relative value basis, but it actually is liquidity-enhancing, because a lot of these institutional investors, whether they're pension funds or endowments or insurance companies are probably trying to beat a bogey of 6% on the low end and 8% on the high end. So if you're generating current short duration floating at 10 plus with rates still on the rise everything in excess of your hurdle is actually helping to refill the bucket of return that you gave up in your fixed income and equity book. So there's a lot at play here driving dollars into the private credit landscape and I would expect that to continue. Sure. Just to clarify we signed, but we're still waiting for regulatory approval. We decided to pull it forward really as an indication of the opportunity that we see there and just felt that by owning 100% versus 80% would give us just a better opportunity to align incentives along a shared vision for growth and really drive growth across the region under the unified Ares brand. So we're super excited about it. And this acceleration I think is a good indication of what we would see there. If you look at the businesses that exist today the legacy SSG businesses we bought was a leader in private credit in two fund families one being a distressed and special sits business, and the other being a more regular way senior lending business. And both of those families of funds have performed well and grown in our two years of ownership. We've been adding people and capabilities across the region. We've talked about on prior calls that we had a successful launch and closing of an Australian-New Zealand direct lending business. We have added senior folks in and around our real estate and infrastructure business. We've added secondaries professionals and raised capital to expand our secondaries business there. So I would say at a high level while a lot of those markets are still developing and don't necessarily offer the same scale of opportunity or breadth of opportunity that the U.S. and Europe do our vision for our APAC business is that at maturity it will be of a similar size as the US and European markets and all of our strategies will be represented there in each of the markets in the region. So it's going to take us a while to build that. And we're going to obviously need to see the markets mature and evolve from a capital formation and regulatory standpoint, but that's the vision. I think from a growth standpoint the good news is that they have been growing at a similar pace to the rest of the platform obviously off of a smaller base, but enjoying good growth and we'd expect that to continue. Jarrod, you want to speak to that one? Yes. Thanks for the question. I think you're spot on that energy transition and climate infrastructure are increasingly important topics across the landscape. I think the good news is we were early in identifying that transition as an opportunity. So as a reminder in our fifth infrastructure fund here which goes back now 2.5 vintages, we pivoted from more traditional energy infrastructure into renewables and renewable energy. And now in the rearview mirror when you look at that fund, about 60% of our deployment in that fifth fund wound up being in the energy transition and renewable power with appropriately high returns relative to traditional power players. That set us up to launch our first climate infrastructure fund, a couple of years ago. Candidly the fundraise took longer than I would have expected because I think we were a little early in recognizing the long-term secular trend there. Good news is it was well raised and well invested and we are now in the market with our second climate infrastructure fund and are actively raising that. And while it's not closed yet, I think given some of the demand for exposure to energy transition, we have confidence that it will be. Obviously, there's a lot of positive catalyst, particularly in the US market on the heels of the Inflation Reduction Act. That's also helping to bolster investor demand. Two, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we obviously made the acquisition of the AMP infrastructure lending business. That team and fund family has been fully-integrated into the platform. We had a successful close on IDF V at $5 billion. Last year that fund is well deployed. And while it invest broadly across the infrastructure spectrum, not surprisingly they too were benefiting from the increase in appetite for in transaction activity within energy transition. And then probably most recently, which we're super excited about is the announcement that we made out of our SPAC Ares Acquisition Corp., where we are entering into a transaction to merge with Ex Energy, which is a fourth generation small modular nuclear reactor business, which we think is really at the forefront and cutting edge of the future of the energy transition. So we're very focused on it. We have multiple products and avenues to invest behind it, and I would think that with continued good performance that that's going to continue to be a good growth area for us.\nGerry O'Hara: Great. Thanks for the reminder and update. That\u2019s it for me. Appreciate it. Thanks Gerry. Yeah. So the good news is these numbers get publicly released so you guys will be able to see how we're doing. I think the good news from our perspective is that we've been having a different experience than some of the larger peers. If you look at our wealth management platform right now, we have obviously our two non-traded REITs AI REIT and AREIT. We have our interval fund. We have our recently launched private markets fund and as we talked about our recently formed non-traded BDC. And if you look across all four, we've actually had positive flows. So to put that in perspective, if you look at inflows into the non-traded REITs, Q4 inflows were about $430 million against outflows about $157 million, so a healthy cushion. Just to contextualize it that $430 million was down from a little over $840 in Q3. So not surprisingly given, I think some of the noise in the channel but also just some of the market reaction to transitions in the real estate business. We've seen slower inflows, but we haven't seen a disproportionate amount of outflows and that's generally been the case throughout the course of the year. Going into 2023, still too early. But again as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, while our two REITs are quite substantial, aggregating about $13.5 billion in the aggregate, we're just growing off of a smaller base. That puts us in a position where we can continue to add distribution partners. And as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we fully expect that we'll be adding two new wirehouse partners for those products in the first half of this year. So some of the headwinds we're able to grow through just as we're adding new distribution relationships. And then we do have some unique elements to our business in terms of how we invest, but probably most importantly is we have a 1031 exchange program that feeds into both of our REITs that just promotes a stickier investor base if you will. So it's something we're watching closely. We are not slowing our investments in the channel. We're still very long-term believers in the growth in that market. And at least as we're experiencing it we've seen a modest slowdown in inflows, but we're not seeing net outflows. Sure. So the update is you're right. We have fully integrated what was the landmark platform. We're very pleased with the way that the integration has grown. We have added a significant number of new people across the platform here in the US and Europe and as I mentioned earlier in Asia Pacific. What we have tried to build just to leverage the strengths that we have within the GP and LP community is kind of a broader set of secondary solutions across the different verticals. We have added a credit secondaries business, which we think really plays to the strength that we have in private credit. We have spun up our team and are actively raising capital there something we're super excited about. We are in the market with our next generation of infrastructure secondaries, which is a big growth area for us. We are currently in the market with our ninth real estate fund, which was a fund that was ready to launch when we acquired. And we did to your point close out our prior vintage of private equity, and we'll be coming back into the market at some point with kind of the Ares version of what that strategy is going to be going forward. We're also excited that we're able to leverage the momentum we have in the wealth management channel to launch the public markets fund, which is largely anchored by our secondaries capability. We're seeing good scaling there and we would expect that to continue to grow. So the business has been fully-integrated. I think, we've repositioned certain of the strategies into higher growth parts of the market. We've opened up growth opportunities in credit and Asia and Infra in a way that didn't exist prior to the acquisition and now we're executing. So we'll keep everybody abreast of the progress there but a lot to be excited about. Yes. Look there's -- needless to say when you just think about real estate the impact of rising rates you have to just think about how interest rate increases correlate to changes in the cap rate and valuation environment and how increased rate challenges certain property sectors from a from a debt service standpoint. I think to your comment we are fortunate that close to 80% of our exposures are in multifamily and industrial and the fundamentals there have been very strong. And so even in a world where valuations may be coming in you're growing through them with an installed base of tenants that is continuing to drive pretty strong NOI at the property level. And I think that's kind of the way to think about it which is not all real estate is created equal. We're in gateway markets with great assets that are all performing really well. In terms of Q4 versus rest of the year, I would only read into that just the math of rates and not any kind of fundamental deterioration in performance. Because as you mentioned when you go drill down in terms of our re-up and re-leasing occupancy rates and what we're able to command given the assets we own the fundamental strength in the portfolio we think is pretty clear. I do think for what it's worth that the real estate markets are going to be one of the more challenging parts of the private market landscape. It's one of the reasons why we're so focused right now on our opportunistic real estate franchises just to make sure that we're appropriately capitalized to take advantage of the distress that should roll through certain parts of that market as rates continue to go up here. Sure. Thank you. No we don't have any. We thank everybody for their time. Sorry, if we went a little late but we appreciate everybody tuning in and for the support and we look forward to giving everybody the update next quarter. Thank you."

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on October 27th, 2022. I will now turn the call over to Carl Drake, Head of Public Markets, Investor Relations for Ares Management.\nCarl Drake: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for our third quarter conference call. I'm joined today by Michael Arougheti, our Chief Executive Officer; and Jarrod Phillips, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin. I want to remind you that comments made during this call contain forward-looking statements and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those identified in Risk Factors in our SEC filings. Our actual results could differ materially, and we undertake no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Please also note that past performance is not a guarantee of future results. During this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Please refer to our third-quarter earnings presentation available on the Investor Resources section of our website for reconciliations of the measures to the most directly-comparable GAAP measures. Please note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Ares Fund. This morning, we announced that we declared our fourth-quarter common dividend of $0.61 per share of our Class-A and non-voting common stock, representing an increase of 30% over our dividend for the same quarter a year-ago. The dividend will be paid on December 30th, 2022, to holders of record on December 16th. Now, I'll turn the call over to Michael Arougheti, who will start with some quarterly financial and business highlights.\nMichael Arougheti: Great. Thank you, Carl, and good morning everyone. I hope you're doing well. In the face of geopolitical tensions and rising inflation, energy costs, and interest rates, our business continues to generate steady growth and deliver strong relative performance for our investors. During the third-quarter, we continued our strong growth in our AUM and fee-related earnings despite the challenging environment and a continued slowdown in overall primary market activity. Our suite of products continues to resonate with our investors as we raised more than $14 billion of gross commitments for the quarter, bringing the year-to-date fundraising total to more than $44 billion. We're pleased with the breadth of our fundraising activity to date, which only included $2.1 billion in fundraising this year from our largest commingled funds. The flexibility of our investment strategies is also reflected in our steady deployment, which remains strong and was relatively flat versus our activity levels a year-ago. These factors drove growth in our AUM metrics, management fees, fee-related earnings, and realized income ranging from 21% to 28% on a year-over-year basis. Before I walk-through some quarterly business highlights, let me start by framing why our business has been so resilient during volatile markets like we're in today. It all starts with our management fee-centric business, which provides a more stable realized income compared to more performance fee-based and balance sheet heavy business models. For example, on a year-to-date basis, we generated more than 90% of our total fee revenues from our management fees and over the same period 92% of our realized income was derived from our fee-related earnings. This rich mix of FRE based earnings has also been steadily increasing over the past three years. Another important component of our business is our asset-light balance sheet, with balance sheet investments representing less than 0.5% of our total AUM. In addition to generating strong returns on equity, this means that we're less susceptible to changes in-market values for risk assets, particularly during times of high market volatility. The structure of our AUM and long-dated and perpetual vehicles also provides insulation from client withdrawals. About 88% of our AUM and 95% of our management fees are from either long-dated funds or perpetual capital vehicles. And due to the long-term nature of this capital, we have not experienced significant redemption issues during volatile periods. This enables us to be patient investors and utilize the capabilities of our experienced teams and our significant dry powder to make new investments and to support portfolio companies during more difficult markets. We believe that the nature and mix of our AUM also provides stability. Approximately 60% of our assets under Management are tied to a diverse range of credit strategies. These credit investments provide protection from declines in valuation multiples during economic downturns since our credit positions are generally in the top half of the capital structures of our portfolio investments. In other words, across the spectrum of private assets, our AUM focus in credit is generally positioned to have comparatively less risk. We believe this also provides meaningful benefits to both our fund investors and to Ares stockholders during rising interest-rate environments, as more than 90% of our debt assets firm wide are floating-rate and can earn higher income as interest rates increase. As an example, ARCC reported on Tuesday that its core earnings would have been 8% higher at the prevailing short-term rates at September 30th been in effect for the entire third-quarter. As rates continue to increase, this should continue to enhance Ares Capital's core earnings as evidenced by the 17% year-to-date increase in ARCC's third quarter dividend, and it provides for the potential for increased ARRC part one fees as well, all else being equal. Across the rest of our asset mix, we believe that our growing AUM and real assets with investments in real estate sectors with strong rent growth and an infrastructure assets that have built-in inflation escalators will be well-positioned to perform in the current market environment. We also believe that our private equity business is also differentiated with its focus on resilient, less cyclical, higher growth industries along with its flexible capital strategy of deploying assets across debt and equity in distressed and other opportunistic assets. So turning to deployment. The current market environment is providing opportunities for us to continue to take market-share and be a consistent capital provider when other traditional providers and public sources are retrenching. Our significant dry powder and the flexibility of our strategy has enabled us to provide a variety of capital solutions to private companies or to play in liquid markets as relative value shifts. Our deployment for the third quarter remained strong at $18 billion, with more than $12 billion in our credit strategies during Q3. We actively invested across the credit spectrum, including take privates, add-on acquisitions, secondary market purchases, financing asset portfolios, and many other types of situations. Nearly half of our activity in our U.S. and European direct lending businesses combined in the quarter was tied to existing incumbent borrowers and our focus continues to be on larger upper middle market companies. In real assets, we selectively invested over $1 billion, primarily in our core real estate segments of industrial and multifamily, and we invested $0.5 billion across our infrastructure strategy. We also deployed over $2 billion in private equity across both our ASOF and ACOF strategies. Our special opportunities team is very excited about the opportunities being presented, particularly investing in high yielding debt in the more volatile liquid markets. Our secondaries group deployed over $500 million as they're seeing increasing transaction activity for both LPs seeking liquidity and GPs seeking additional capital for growth. And we'd expect secondary opportunities to gain momentum over the coming quarters as private equity investors and managers seek solutions for the capital allocation and balances that they're facing. We also invested $1.4 billion across Ares SSG and via our affiliated insurance platforms. There's been a lot of discussion in the market about the denominator effect in slowing allocations to alternatives by investors. Through the end of the third quarter, we have not experienced this to the same degree and we understand others have. Our leading floating rate credit strategies and real asset strategies also continue to resonate with investors as they are seen as either beneficiaries or insulated from some of today's market headwinds. Overall for the third-quarter, we raised $14.2 billion across more than 50 different funds and accounts with more than 90% of the direct capital derived from our existing investor base. One highlight for the quarter was our final closing of our inaugural sports, media, and entertainment fund at $3.7 billion in commitments within the fund and related vehicles. This strategy is a great example of how we can leverage our team and the advantages of our broad platform to create exciting new adjacent strategies for our investors. ASOF II raised $1.3 billion during the third quarter and just held its final closing at its hard cap of $7.1 billion, which is more than double the size of our inaugural fund from three years ago. At quarter end, our 10th U.S. value-add real estate private equity fund held its final closing at $1.8 billion, well ahead of its target and over 75% larger than its predecessor fund. And we're pleased to report that our infrastructure debt strategy is being well received as we closed on another $500 million, bringing the total amount of AUM to $3.9 billion for our fifth fund. We also increased our AUM in our first Australia and New Zealand direct lending fund as we continue to build out investment capabilities and capital in the Asia Pacific region. Within real estate, our fourth U.S. opportunistic fund, which was recently launched, has attracted significant interest from investors and is expected to hold the first closing in Q4. With a $3 billion target, we anticipate that the early closings will equal or exceed the size of the predecessor fund. Our perpetual capital funds also continued to see strong inflows. Our two non-traded REITs raised approximately $850 million of equity commitments during Q3 with approximately $100 million in redemptions. Overall, debt and equity commitments raised from perpetual funds totaled $4.2 billion during the third-quarter as perpetual capital increased 24% from the year ago period to $89 billion. We expect to add at least one wirehouse for non-traded REIT distribution during the fourth quarter with more expected next year. Our affiliated insurance company, Aspida, is beginning to gain momentum and at $1.2 billion of new annuities in the third quarter across its reinsurance platform and new retail platform that launched at the end of June. Aspida now has over $4.5 billion in AUM of which a little over 50% is now sub-advised by our own investment teams. We're also excited about the expanding opportunity set for our secondaries business. On November 7th, we'll be completing the final step of our integration process and fully transitioning the Landmark business to be referred to as Ares Secondaries to better leverage the platform and the strength of the Ares brand. We continue to invest heavily in the Secondaries Group by adding senior talent, including real estate capabilities in Asia Pacific, and our new revenue synergies are playing out as we expected. We plan to launch our third infrastructure secondaries fund and we expect to launch new strategies within credit and private equity secondaries. The retail private markets fund is also starting to see inflows pickup, and we're partnering with retail technology platforms to enable access on wirehouse platforms next year. Now, let me turn to the future pipeline. As discussed on our last earnings call, we were at the beginning stages of launching a significant fundraising cycle for a number of funds where the predecessor funds were among our largest commingled funds. In addition to our ongoing activities with perpetual funds, managed accounts, and our existing commingled funds we've had in the market this year, we have recently launched or expect to launch commingled funds in the next three months that will target more than $45 billion, inclusive of fund leverage. We continue to expect first closings of some of these new funds in the first-half of 2023. This $45 billion of target fundraising includes our two largest fund series, our sixth European direct lending fund, and our third U.S. senior direct lending fund, along with others including our second flagship closed end alternative credit fund, our seventh corporate private equity fund, our fourth U.S. opportunistic real-estate fund, our second climate infrastructure fund, and our third infrastructure secondaries fund. As the public markets continue to report losses across equities and fixed-income, our fund results were generally strong across our various credit, real estate, and private equity strategies. In direct lending, our senior direct lending and junior direct lending strategies generated gross returns of 1.4% and 0.3% for the quarter and 12% and 6.7% for the last 12 months respectively. European direct lending returns also held up well, totaling 3.4% in the quarter on a gross basis and 11% for the last 12 months. The European direct lending portfolio is benefiting from lower overall leverage, strong interest coverage, and generally strong covenant packages. Real estate continued its strong performance as our U.S. equity composite generated gross quarterly returns of 2.8% and 33.4% over the past 12 months along with increased NAVs for both of our non-traded REITs. Our focus on industrial and multifamily continues to generate strong performance based on the fundamental tailwinds for rent growth, generally in excess of inflation in these sectors. Our European real estate composite declined 1.8% growth for the quarter, but increased 9.4% for the trailing 12 months. Our private equity portfolio performed particularly well during the third quarter, despite the overall declines in the public equity markets. Our ACOF composite increased 2.7% growth in the quarter and is up 10.7% over the past 12 months, primarily driven by strong revenue and EBITDA growth across the portfolio, as we've invested behind resilient sectors with attractive secular tailwinds. Our special opportunities business continues to thrive in this environment, not only raising and deploying a significant amount of capital in the quarter but also generating strong Q3 gross returns of 4.1%. Over the past 12 months, ASOF I has generated gross returns of 9.8%. In secondaries where returns are reported on a one quarter lag basis, our private equity strategies declined 5.6% on a gross basis, largely related to currency depreciation related to our European assets. But over the past 12 months, the strategy is still generated a positive 14.8%. Real estate secondaries was very strong, up 6.4% on a gross basis in the quarter and up 45.4% over the past year. And now with that, let me turn the call over to Jarrod to walk through our third quarter financial results in detail and to provide an updated outlook. Jarrod?\nJarrod Phillips: Thanks Mike. Hello everyone. And thank you for joining us again this quarter. As Mike mentioned, our third quarter results emphasized the resilient nature of our business as we delivered strong growth in management fees, fee-related earnings, and fee-paying AUM. Our quarterly management fees increased 23% year-over-year to $552 million driven by continued deployment and growth in our fee-paying AUM. Our other fee income totaled $28 million in the third quarter, up over $5 million in the second quarter and more than double a year ago. The quarterly increase was driven predominantly by property-related development fees from our non-traded REITs in addition to our typical capital structuring and origination fees and certain of our direct lending perpetual funds. In the third quarter, we generated $233 million of FRE, an increase of 28% over the third quarter of 2021. As expected, we had virtually no fee-related performance revenues during the third quarter and we continue to expect 90% or more of our annual FRPR to occur in the fourth quarter. Through September 30th, our non-traded REITs had agreed $159 million gross performance participation for Ares. As these funds pay on an annual basis, this value is not included in our accrued net performance income or our fee-related performance revenues since it remains subject to the fund's future returns. FRE as a percentage of realized income was over 95% in the third-quarter, driven by the steady growth in our management fees and more modest net realized performance income. Our FRE margin for the third quarter was 40.2%, up slightly over the second quarter and up over 100 basis points versus the third quarter of 2021. We continue to feel good about the 45% margin target as well as the other targets we laid out at our Investor Day last year. We generated $11 million of realized net performance income roughly in-line with the third quarter of 2021 and down slightly on a year-to-date basis compared to 2021. Realizations this quarter were driven mainly by exits in our real estate equity funds, which has performed well and are now approaching the end of their fund life. Realized income for the third quarter totaled $243 million, up 22% year-over-year. After-tax realized income per share of Class A common stock was $0.75 for the third quarter, up from $0.62 in the third quarter of 2021 and well ahead of our declared dividend of $0.61. As we highlighted at our Investor Day last year, we have been meaningfully scaling our European waterfall funds over the past five years and many of the early funds are beginning to season. We continue to expect to ramp-up in their contribution to realized net performance income in the years ahead with accelerated growth thereafter as larger funds begin to contribute. In total, we have $105 billion in European waterfall style eligible funds, of which about $80 billion in credit or credit life funds, which we believe should build a growing base of more consistent net realized performance income in future years once we reach the harvesting periods for these funds. Looking at the realized performance income potential in our European waterfall funds over the next few years, we currently have approximately $20 billion in incentive generating AUM, primarily from funds that are out of their reinvestment period. In these funds, we currently have approximately $300 million of accrued and accumulated net performance income, and we expect to realize the vast majority of this amount over the next two years. We expect the recognition of this income to ramp-up over the coming quarters with roughly one-third in 2023 and then two-thirds expected to be realized in 2024. In the current fourth quarter, we are anticipating some early European waterfall distributions, totaling roughly $40 million in realized net performance fee income related to the strong returns in our funds this year. We continue to have significant value in American style waterfall funds that are eligible for realizations as well, where we're being patient due to the current softer realization environment and these private equity strategies. Our accrued net performance income, which includes both European and American waterfall style funds, increased 5.8% in the quarter to $888 million and is up nearly 10% year-to-date despite the difficult market backdrop. This increase was largely due to increases in EBITDA offsetting multiple compression in our private equity portfolio and rising interest rates and the credit portfolio, increasing the yield of those investments further in excess of the fixed hurdle rates of the funds. Turning to our AUM and related metrics, our assets under management totaled $341 billion, an increase of over 2% quarter-over quarter, and up 21% from $282 billion in the third quarter of 2021. Our AUM growth was driven by strong fundraising across the platform. Importantly, we generated these inflows with only $2.1 billion in closes this year from any of our five largest flagship funds as the expansion of both our product set and distribution channels continues to increase our fundraising capability. Going forward, our fundraising pipeline is as strong as Mike stated. The significant number of sizable flagships will have in the market is expected to set us up for an increase in fund raising for 2023 compared to 2022. Our fee-paying AUM totaled $219 billion at quarter-end, an increase of 3.5% from the second quarter and up 27% in the third quarter of 2021. Our growth in fee-paying AUM was primarily driven by deployment in our direct lending, alternative credit, real estate debt, and special opportunity strategies, which are all paid on invested capital. Having significant amount of dry powder, should be highly advantageous as we navigate future volatility. As of September 30th, our available capital totaled nearly $88 billion, and we ended the quarter with over $45 billion AUM not yet paying fees available for future deployment. As a result, we remain well positioned to capitalize on current market dislocations. Looking at our historical pace of deployment, we have generally deployed our available capital over an 18- to 24-month period. However, we recognize that periods of extreme volatility can impact our deployment pace. Finally, our incentive eligible AUM increased by over 15% year-over-year to $198 billion, of this amount $66 billion was uninvested at quarter end, which represents a meaningful amount of potential future value creation opportunities for us. So in summary, we believe the combination of this available capital with our management fee and FRE rich business in asset-light balance sheet, positions us well in this uncertain environment. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Mike for his concluding remarks.\nMichael Arougheti: Thanks Jarrod. I believe our results underscore the durability and consistent trajectory of our business and our ability to take advantage of weaker competition during times of volatility and uncertainty. Over the past two quarters, the global equity markets declined more than 20% and banks and the liquid credit markets have been severely constrained. During this time, we've delivered strong relative investment performance across most of our funds, continued growth in AUM, management fees and fee-related earnings, and improved our operating margins even while continuing to scale our platform. While there are clearly challenges that lie ahead, we have a deep and experienced team that has demonstrated an ability to grow consistently through volatile markets. The combination of our experience, sizable platform, portfolio positioning, long-dated capital base, and ample dry powder, all provide us with the tools that we need to generate successful investment outcomes for our clients, which in turn we believe will drive successful results for Ares' stockholders. I'd like to end by expressing my appreciation for the hard work and dedication of all of our employees around the globe. I'm also deeply thankful to our investors for their continued support of our Company. And with that, I'd just thank you for your time today. And operator, could you please open up the line for questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler of Bank of America. Please go ahead when you're ready, Craig.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Good morning Mike, hope you and the team are doing well.\nMichael Arougheti: Thanks Craig.\nCraig Siegenthaler: So we appreciate the updated commentary on the European waterfall opportunity. It looks like the 2023 and '24 performance fees are mostly going to come from a handful of 2017 and 2018 vintage drawdown funds in private credit. But the subsequent vintages have scaled larger. So does this mean this European waterfall ramp will continue beyond 2024 with the newer vintages, or is this fee stream going to be more cyclical and could exhibit some deceleration like your American waterfall funds?\nJarrod Phillips: Hi Craig, it's Jarrod. Thanks for the question. I think the way you'd want to think about it is, and we've talked about it a lot - it will track similar to how management fees also. As we deploy, we earn more management fees. In this case, that's what we think so exciting about these European waterfall style funds is that as the subsequent vintages have been raised larger and as they're deploying, they're often deploying at a yield on the individual assets above the hurdle rate. So they're building that pre-balance over time. So we actually expect a steady and growing balance of accrued related to these, European style waterfall and that it would continue period-over-period, much like management fees do.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Jarrod, that's great. Just as my follow-up, you had a really strong quarter on the investing front. Credit drove 12 out of the 18 can this, trajectory sort of continue? And are there any headwinds to investing, especially on the credit side of the business, where I think you're more flexible versus some of the other funds where you need more willing sellers?\nMichael Arougheti: No, I think deployment can continue. As we talked about in the prepared remarks, Craig, the beauty of the platform is; one, it's diversified by asset class and by geography, and the bulk of our strategies have the ability to pivot into the liquid markets when we get into a volatile backdrop, move up and down the balance sheet. So not surprisingly, even when primary market slows, we still have the ability to deploy pretty actively, and that's showing up in the numbers.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Great, thank you guys.\nMichael Arougheti: Thanks Craig.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.\nAlex Blostein: Hi, good morning everybody, thanks for the question as well. I wanted to start off with a question around retail strategy. AREITs one and two, I guess, seen pretty good flows in the quarter at about $1 billion. We've obviously seen a slowdown from some of the larger peers. I think you've been adding distribution partners over the last couple of quarters? So, help me maybe dissect a little bit how much of the continued strength in fundraising for those vehicles has been a function of new platforms versus same-store sales generally remaining pretty strong. And then, I guess, as a follow-up to that, what are, the sort of near-term plans for the further sort of expansion in the retail channel?\nMichael Arougheti: Sure, thanks, Alex. So good news, bad news is that the two non-traded REITs raised $842 million in the quarter, which was up from $818 million last quarter. And I think also importantly, those inflows came against some fairly insignificant outflows, which is what we saw last quarter as well. I think quarterly redemptions this quarter were about $85 million. And so I think we are outperforming the peer set, both in terms of the inflow and the net. That's the good news. The bad news, if you want to call it that, is we're actually still doing that with our existing selling group so all of that is same-store. As we talked about in the prepared remarks, we expect to add one-wire platform for the non-traded REITs by the end of the year, and have a pipeline of other partners that we would expect to bring online into the new year.\nAlex Blostein: Great, that's helpful, thanks Mike. And then my...\nMichael Arougheti: Sorry, you just asked about product expansion. I think folks are aware we have our PMF product, which we referenced in the script as well. We're beginning to see inflows accelerate there. And we are in registration, as people know, with ASIF, our private BDC, which we are hopeful will be well received given our private credit franchise.\nAlex Blostein: Awesome, thanks for that. My follow-up was for Jarrod just thinking through the follow-up to Craig's question around the European waterfall. Obviously, that will create a bit of more recurring nature to the overall earnings base for Ares in addition to, obviously, very strong growth in management fees in FRE. How does that inform your dividend philosophy? I think, for now, the dividend is largely tied to the direction of fee-related earnings growth? But with lots of visibility into realized income or realized performance fees from European waterfall style funds, should we be thinking that your approach to dividend will sort of include that? In other words, the payout, as a percentage of FRE, could ultimately increase and the direction of travel is meaningfully higher from here?\nJarrod Phillips: It's something we'll continue to monitor, certainly. However, as you know, being a balance sheet like manager, we pride ourselves on our flexibility and our ability to take advantage of different markets and opportunities. And I wouldn't want to guess what might be available to us as these really come on in earnest, and I'd want to maintain our flexibility in regards to that. So if there was an acquisition opportunity or organic growth opportunity that, that cash would be well suited to investing, I wouldn't want to take that opportunity away. But it's certainly something that we'll always be aware of as we're mapping out what our dividend will be.\nAlex Blostein: All right, we'll stay tuned. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have Patrick Davitt of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead when you are ready Patrick.\nPatrick Davitt: Hi, good morning everyone. You mentioned the $1.2 billion of organic growth from the insurance platform. They just launched annuity writing there in June. So is that a good kind of baseline to think about the run rate organic growth from that annuity writing or do you expect it to continue to ramp from here?\nMichael Arougheti: My expectation is it will ramp from there. To remind folks, we talked at our Investor Day that prior to being onboarded onto the Ares platform, that distribution engine was originating close to $2 billion per year organic. We're obviously quickly getting to that level, but I think we went into this endeavor with a view that as we scale that we would be able to do better than that. So I think it is a very exciting baseline given how early we are in the underwriting [maneuvers] having started only at the end of June, but my hope and expectation would be that as we continue to scale the capital base, the speed of those numbers could grow.\nPatrick Davitt: Great helpful. And a quick follow-up, you mentioned the non-traded REIT accrual of $159 million. Are there any other chunky 4Q crystallizations you have - visibility on other than that in the European waterfall you pointed out?\nJarrod Phillips: Yes, to be clear, the REITs are in [FRPR], and they're not included in our accrual. The other amount that comes into FRPR - is the perpetual capital related to the credit funds. We have about $10 billion of AUM, and we had about $10 billion last year as well. There's a couple of factors to take into consideration there, which is, you have the rising interest rates that benefit it, but credit spreads, as they widen within a given year, they can be a little bit of a drag. So I think, all in, when you consider what we have from the REITs and what you have from the credit side, that we'd expect that number to be slightly larger than it was last year. But overall, there's a lot of inputs that will go into it in the fourth quarter in terms of what credit spreads are doing, what interest rates do and as well as the fair value of the assets of the REIT. And in terms of the realization that we had, the realization that we had - the realization that we had or that we mentioned there of $40 million, that's really related to our European-style waterfall that pay periodically in order to make certain tax payments that are required by those funds. It's not the start of the European waterfall in earnest, which we really look to 2023 and 2024 for.\nPatrick Davitt: Got it, very helpful, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Patrick. Your next question comes from Benjamin Budish from Barclays. Please go ahead when you are ready.\nBenjamin Budish: Hi guys, thanks so much for taking question. I just wanted to check on the $45 billion you mentioned from the flagship fund rating cycle. I think last quarter you talked about $30 billion coming from just four funds. Does the $45 billion include like an upsized expectation for the four or is that just you're now sort of including a broader expectation from more strategies?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, I think given the attractiveness of the deployment environment and the demand that we're seeing from our investors for some of our core credit fund, that's a reflection that we've actually pulled one of our flagships up in the fundraising queue to raise it earlier than we had originally anticipated.\nBenjamin Budish: Okay, great, that's very helpful. And, then I kind of wanted to follow-up on the retail side. Can you maybe talk about -- it sounds like a flows are kind of continue really nicely. What's the sort of competitive environment like -- I'm kind of thinking specifically like the wirehouses where you're already distributed; how often are advisors deciding between Ares fund versus competitor, how much exclusivity is there? Just how should we kind of think about that?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, I think the good news is, the market is still fairly fragmented, but in my opinion beginning to consolidate, and it's consolidating with managers like Ares who have a couple of things going for them; one, a broad and diverse set of products that's attractive to the financial advisor and retail community; two, strong performance in those products; three, a commitment to distribution in education in that channel as evidenced by the 130 plus people that we have in and around our Wealth Management Solutions business; and four is a deep and long-standing relationship with the street and the wire platforms having raised and manage things like ARCC and ACRE and all work institutional funds that already sit in the hands of a lot of high-net worth clients. So there are others that have those competitive strengths but they are few and far between. And if you look at the published results of whose taking share, I think we are slowly creeping up the lead tables at the top in terms of those that are seeing incremental flows. I can't tell you exactly to be honest how an adviser in the field is choosing to put their client into these products, whether they're choosing an Ares real estate product alongside another competitive product, or they're choosing one. But if you look at the flows, they are broad-based, they are deepening. We're actually seeing the number of advisers that we're doing business with increasing. And we're actually seeing the average ticket increase. So the numbers would tell you that, even if the advisers choosing between competitive product, that we are actually doing business with more advisers to a larger dollar amount per adviser.\nBenjamin Budish: Okay, great. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\nMichael Arougheti: Thank you.\nOperator: We now have Brian McKenna with JMP Securities. Your line is now open.\nBrian McKenna: Great, thanks. So the closing of your second special opportunities fund is very timely. So $7 billion of dry powder --- $7 billion of dry powder, what specific areas of the market are most interesting right now to invest into for this fund? And then returns for the first vintage are quite impressive with the 26% net IRR. So what's the expectation for returns in the second fund?\nMichael Arougheti: Hi Brian, we're fortunate that Scott Graves who runs that product is here with us, so I'll let him answer that.\nScott Graves: Good morning. The market for the ASOF strategy is obviously very attractive. It's a strategy which will pivot on a relative value basis between what we're seeing in private market debt and equity hybrid securities against the backdrop of secondary market solutions at a discount. That relative value bounces back and forth, and it's done in multiple times this year. In the first quarter, private markets were clearly our focus, now is where we refined it at around the value. We obviously saw a significant trade-off in secondary fixed income, accelerated into that market in the second-quarter, saw the rally coming off of the second quarter earnings, pivoted back to privates, now we're pivoting back to publics. So it tends to move back and forth. But this strategy is really ideal for what we refer to as vintage diversification. So when you see other more traditional illiquid alternative asset strategies decelerate in deployment due to a lack of transaction volume, this is a strategy which can accelerate into that market and create that vintage diversification.\nBrian McKenna: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have Gerald O'Hara of Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nGerald O'Hara: Great. Thanks and good morning folks. Appreciate the color on the future pipeline, whole host of funds coming to market. Perhaps, you can give us a little bit of incremental color on how we should think about the FRE margin from there. Is it going to be a function of those raised and deployed and invested? Is there any sort of possibility of kind of a step-function there as one or multiple funds kind of go-live in their investment cycle? Or anything that you could perhaps give us some increment incremental context, that would be helpful.\nMichael Arougheti: Sure, I'll remind you, and we really looked into this year, like I said, at the beginning of the year, that this was a year we'd be making investments in our people and our technology so that we could prepare for what we knew was coming pretty large fund raise cycle. So ultimately that fundraise cycle will take anywhere from a year in that range, and we'll still be hiring behind that. And then as we deploy that, the majority of those funds are earning management fees upon deployment. So that will, as you've noted, allow us to accelerate our margins. So if you look at and what we've laid out as our margin target of 45% plus. That's why we reaffirmed that in the script, and if we feel comfortable there, as this is an accelerant to that; the ability to deploy these funds will certainly be very margin-accretive.\nJarrod Phillips: Jarrod here. Just to clarify that, if you look at which funds we referenced were in that pipeline, the bulk of those are our largest credit funds which pay on deployment. But one that is not is our seventh corporate private equity fund which pays on committed. So to the extent that that is successful in 2023 in raising, you will see a step-function margin improvement in that particular part of the business.\nGerald O'Hara: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then just as a follow up, I just kind of reading headlines this morning, you kind of see the term golden age for private credit. And clearly, you all are at the forefront, but as I sort of think about to put myself in the shoes of perhaps and the dominant or pension plan allocator who's looking at public credits that are perceived at least with potentially less risk and now higher yield, how are the competitive dynamics kind of shaking out with your private credit opportunities versus other opportunities or fixed income products in the market?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, there's a lot to unpack there. So I'm going to try to be succinct, and if you want to drill down on any particular standing. First, you have to differentiate between performance of fixed rate, fixed income within traditional investor portfolios in the form of sovereign debt, investment grade debt, and high-yield debt. And obviously, when rates are going up, you have the dual impact of value declines in the existing book and increasing pressures at the company-level. So I think there's a, lot of folks that are just dealing with the rapid decline in values that has come with the rapid rise in rates. That actually makes private credit and other floating rate fixed income product all the more valuable and important to start to recoup some of those losses at this point in the rate cycle. So I think, first, I just want to make sure that we're differentiating that. The positioning between private credit and traditional fixed income is often balancing act. I think right now they're having two totally different experiences on either side of the house in terms of the rate move. In terms of private credit and its competitive positioning, and I think Scott hinted at this. Right now if you look at the traditional markets and their ability to provide liquidity to private companies, I don't know if we have a golden age of private credit going on, but we have a golden age in some respects of private markets in the sense that we have more companies in the private markets than we ever had before. They're staying private longer. Public markets are getting more and more concentrated. I think people are reevaluating the value of liquidity in the public markets. So there's more capital that is finding its way into those private markets and that maybe, I didn't see the headline what people are referring to. So again, that structural shift in the markets in the economy, right now the public markets for all intents and purposes are not opened as a provider of capital to growing private companies. The leveraged loan market is largely unavailable. The high yield market is largely unavailable. So from a competitive positioning standpoint, having the amount of dry powder that we have across the platform I think we feel great about the competitive positioning. We're in a position now to be one, if not the only type of liquidity providers that are active in a market like this.\nGerald O'Hara: Okay, that's perfect. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have Finian O'Shea of Wells Fargo Securities.\nFinian O'Shea: Hi, good afternoon or good morning. Sorry, another one on deployment. We're seeing headlines of a move back toward all-cash buyouts. Is this something you're seeing more widely in middle-market private equity? And understanding that a lot of these companies will eventually borrow or lever up, is there an impact from that that is more or less favorable to direct lending?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, I don't know if I would say that based on what we're seeing, and Mitch and Kipp are here with me as well, that we're seeing all-cash buyouts in the pipeline. I think what you may be referring to is, if you just think about what's going on in the private equity universe. Valuation multiples are obviously compressing, given the change in discount rate and against the rise in interest rates. There's a lot of price discovery happening in the market, in the primary market in terms of where transactions will clear. And I think the leverage providers like us have been pretty disciplined around where we're willing to attach from a leverage standpoint and at what price and what terms. So to the extent that there is a disconnect between the leverage finance markets and where a private equity buyer would like to clear a transaction, I think they will use incremental cash to bridge it. So maybe the way to think about is not all-cash but higher cash contribution in order to clear quality transaction in today's market, but I don't think that we're seeing a move to all cash. But to your point, is it good for private credit, I think the answer again in a market like this where liquidity sources are scarce, limited, and we're one of the few that have scale and flexibility, I think it's going to be a pretty good vintage course.\nFinian O'Shea: Thanks, that's helpful. Just a small follow. I think you mentioned the base rate impact would be another approximately 8% improvement for the fourth-quarter for performance. Is that the extent of it in the context of the today's LIBOR curve, or is there still a visible uptick into next year?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, so just to clarify that, 8% was just reciting what Kipp and Mitch and others have talked about on the ARCC call, which was all else being equal if we just enjoyed the in-place rise in rates, income would have gone up 8%. So the answer is, there is absolutely more to go to the extent that we have continued rate increases which we all expect. And the reason that we talked about the 8% is the way that these flowed through the portfolio companies and then ultimately into our portfolios is it backward-looking averages, and so it takes a couple of months to get the full effect of any rate increase. So if we maintain the current trajectory rate increases, you'll continue to see that phenomenon. And I think as Jarrod mentioned, most of the incentive fees that we earn off of our floating rate credit funds are against fixed rate hurdles. And so not only are we delivering higher ROE in distributions at the portfolio level to our investors, but it has a meaningful impact on the incentive fee-generating opportunity that we have in our credit book.\nFinian O'Shea: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have Adam Beatty with UBS. Your line is now open.\nAdam Beatty: Thank you and good morning. Couple of follow-ups on Aspida. I appreciate the comments earlier around organic growth and the kind of sizing that out. Just wanted to get your thoughts on how you're thinking about potential inorganic opportunities there, number-one, from what you're seeing in the marketplace and also, number two, from a perspective of balance sheet capacity? Thank you.\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. So the way that we set up Aspida intentionally was to have side-by-side pillars of our organic annuities and life business next to our Aspida reinsurance business which gives us the opportunity to look at organic annuities distribution, flow reinsurance, and then inorganic opportunities all side-by-side. And what we are trying to do there is make sure that we understand the ROEs that we can generate in each of those opportunities as we use our capital. I think the good news is given the market right now that we're in, we are generating higher ROEs. I think that we originally underwrote just given where we're able to price liabilities against the assets that we're generating. So our view right now is all three of those are attractive and scaling. And the inorganic opportunities we've talked about are pretty significant and growing. We continue to see traditional insurance companies simplify their business models and look for either reinsurance partners or look to sales of portions of their business to folks like Aspida, so I think the inorganic opportunities as good as we've seen. In terms of balance sheet capacity, I would maybe just remind you, our view as a balance sheet light asset managers that we have been growing that platform largely with third party capital. And so while we made a significant upfront investment to get all the capabilities and talent around that business, the scaling from that formation moment has been largely done with third-party capital, and I would expect that to continue.\nAdam Beatty: That's great, thank you Mike. Just one follow-up on that around the changing rate regime. Do you expect that to change the opportunities for inorganic growth one-way or the other? Thanks.\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, I do. I think there are a number of catalysts that will bring assets into the market. The changing rate regime is one of them. So like I said. I would expect that the pipeline of inorganic will largely pickup over time, rates being one of the drivers.\nAdam Beatty: Okay, super. That's all from me today. Thank you.\nMichael Arougheti: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have the next question on the line from Rufus Hone of BMO Capital Markets. May proceed with your question.\nRufus Hone: Great. Good morning. Thanks very much. I wanted to come back to some of the comments you made around private credit. And I was wondering whether you're seeing any differentiation between the U.S. and European direct lending businesses in terms of the fundamental performance of the company's you lend to. And the credit metrics you're seeing across the different geographies seen from the ARCC call that the U.S. business hasn't seen much change in recent months, and I'm just wondering if you feel the same about Europe? And more generally, when do you expect some credit deterioration to start to come through? Thank you.\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. So the simple answer is, as we sit here today we are not seeing material, credit weakness in any of our credit portfolio. So you talked about ARCC. On our most recent earnings call, we highlighted that nonaccruals were low at 1.6% of the portfolio at cost, meaningfully lower at fair value. And if you look at that Company, it has almost 20-year history, the 10-year average was about 2.5%. If you look at our European direct lending investments, actually stronger fundamental performance in terms of interest coverage, leverage and some underlying metrics just based on how those portfolios were positioned going into the current environment. So again, very low nonaccruals and strong performance. And we see that in the liquid markets as well, right? If you look at coverage levels in the high-grade market, I think we're pushing 10 to 11 times interest coverage in high grade. We're at five to six times interest coverage in the high-yield market, well in excess of two times coverage in the loan market. So there's a lot to be concerned about on the forward trajectory for the global economy. But these portfolios are going into this uncertain period with a lot of fundamental strength and just given the interest rate environment that we were in, while the rate of change is significant, the absolute level of interest rates, at least until this point, has not shown up in any kind of portfolio distress. When will we see it you asked, I wish I had a perfect crystal ball to tell you. I do think that the European economies will have a different experience just given the structure of the economy, and how they're experiencing inflation versus how we are. But I'm not as anxious maybe as some of the public markets are indicating we should be just given the strength of the underwriting. And as I said in our prepared remarks, the bulk of these assets are controlled at the top half of the capital structure with a significant amount of structural protection around them and a lot of equity subordination from institutional equity providers that is there to help these companies get through uncertain times. So I think we are appreciative that we all should expect that it's going to become more challenging before it becomes less challenging. But going in with a lot of strength, and we're not seeing a lot of differentiation right now between the U.S. and Europe.\nRufus Hone: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nMichael Cyprys: Great, hi good morning, and thanks for squeezing me in. Just wanted to circle back on the portfolio marks that you guys took in the quarter, I was hoping you might be able to elaborate a bit on what some of the drivers were of the positive marks that you had in real estate and PE in a period where markets were broadly down, and we had seen some others take some markdowns on their books that looked pretty strong for you guys? And then in credit, it seemed a bit more mix. Some of your credit strategies were marked up, but then when I look at the AUM role for credit that was negative there. So I was hoping you could maybe unpack what was positive versus what was negative and markdown in credit?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, I think we said it in the prepared remarks, I don't think that there's that much more to drill down on the - if you look at private equity in the ACOF funds, what that's a reflection of is the sectors that we are invested in, including energy, our higher growth, higher return on invested capital type businesses. And so, the pace of EBITDA growth across those portfolios, which was in the mid to high single-digits, outpaced the deterioration in valuation multiple. Same thing for our real estate business, as we talked about, given our rigorous focus on industrial and multifamily, we continue to see very significant increases in rents and lease rates, continue to see very healthy occupancy rates. So the fundamental performance continues to outpace any deterioration in value that's being caused by a shift in rates. In terms of credit, again, most of the credit portfolio, as you saw this with ARCC. Are modestly down on book value, largely as a reflection of the rate environment, but again, are growing through that. And don't forget the value of current income in this rate environment. So the way to think about the attractiveness of the private credit markets is, if you see a 300-basis-point increase in base rates, 150 to 200 basis point increase in spreads, you're accumulating a significant amount of excess return relative to where you were six to nine months ago. And so even if you are absorbing a decline in your NAV of 1% to 2%, the all-in return in those portfolios continues to be meaningfully positive, which is why I think it's so attractive to investors and is proving to be quite durable. So we're not really seeing significant underperformance on the credit side of the house.\nMichael Cyprys: Great, and just a follow-up. I know you guys have flagged the significant floating rate exposure that you guys have on the credit book. But just any help on how you think about the credit impact to those issuers of having to pay a lot more in terms of interest income? How are they protecting themselves? How much of that is hedged out on that side? How you view that as a potential credit negative event for the issuer? And what happens with those hedges rolling off over time? How do you think about that and protect those issuers?\nMichael Arougheti: Sure, so a couple of comments here. One, we obviously are very actively engaged with these portfolio companies. One of the benefits of being in the private credit markets the way that we are as the lead agent lead investor, we're highly engaged, so yes, there is a fair amount of hedging that is going on in the underlying portfolios. Those will eventually roll off and/or become less effective than they were maybe six to nine months ago. But there are effective hedges in place that is muting the impact from a coverage standpoint at the portfolio company level. I just want to take a step back because usually when we're talking about future risk of recession and default rates, we're talking about it coming off of, to my earlier comment, much weaker fundamental performance and not really attributing it to a rise in rates. So one way to think about this is all of the value of the rate increases that is theoretically challenging the companies is coming to us. And now everybody is waiting to see if earnings decline. But as of now, all of that \"value transfer\" has come to us as a private credit owner, whereas in past cycles, you would have the opposite, that the bulk of the decline in credit coverage would be coming from earnings degradation that would be harmful to us as well as harmful to the equity. So now we get to go into this cycle to the extent that the company gets somewhat challenged from the combination of continued rate increases and earnings declines where we have the flexibility to work with our equity partners in those portfolios to resolve the liquidity needs of the company. And obviously, we've been doing this for a long time. That could take the form of increased interest, but increased noncash interest. It could take the form of structural accommodations. It could take the form of allowing cash to come into the business in the form of equity or subordinated debt below us. So there are a lot of tools that you will use as you're transitioning. But I think it's important that people appreciate, through the lens of the private credit, most of that value and yours to the benefit of the private credit portion of the capital stack sitting at the top half of the balance sheet. And is not that it's a good thing, per se, for the company, but it is a transfer of value from the company to the credit or from the equity to the credit. And that's generally how this has played out in past cycles as well. But we're still a long way from that. Like I said, there's a pretty significant amount of broad-based health across the portfolios. And while the rate increases have been significant, this market has thrived and flourished in a 5% base rate requirement before. So I think people need to have some historical perspective as well.\nMichael Cyprys: And what portion would you say is hedged or protected at the portfolio company level?\nMichael Arougheti: I think in the U.S. book, it's about 30%. And in the European book, it's significantly higher than that.\nMichael Cyprys: Great, thank you.\nMichael Arougheti: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to hand the call back to Michael Arougheti for some closing comments.\nMichael Arougheti: I don't think that we have any other event to say thank you for your continued support and your time today, and we hope that you have a wonderful end of the year and look forward to catching up around our fourth quarter earnings in the New Year.\nOperator: Thank you for joining.

            "name": "Jarrod Phillips",
            "content": "Thanks Mike. Hello everyone. And thank you for joining us again this quarter. As Mike mentioned, our third quarter results emphasized the resilient nature of our business as we delivered strong growth in management fees, fee-related earnings, and fee-paying AUM. Our quarterly management fees increased 23% year-over-year to $552 million driven by continued deployment and growth in our fee-paying AUM. Our other fee income totaled $28 million in the third quarter, up over $5 million in the second quarter and more than double a year ago. The quarterly increase was driven predominantly by property-related development fees from our non-traded REITs in addition to our typical capital structuring and origination fees and certain of our direct lending perpetual funds. In the third quarter, we generated $233 million of FRE, an increase of 28% over the third quarter of 2021. As expected, we had virtually no fee-related performance revenues during the third quarter and we continue to expect 90% or more of our annual FRPR to occur in the fourth quarter. Through September 30th, our non-traded REITs had agreed $159 million gross performance participation for Ares. As these funds pay on an annual basis, this value is not included in our accrued net performance income or our fee-related performance revenues since it remains subject to the fund's future returns. FRE as a percentage of realized income was over 95% in the third-quarter, driven by the steady growth in our management fees and more modest net realized performance income. Our FRE margin for the third quarter was 40.2%, up slightly over the second quarter and up over 100 basis points versus the third quarter of 2021. We continue to feel good about the 45% margin target as well as the other targets we laid out at our Investor Day last year. We generated $11 million of realized net performance income roughly in-line with the third quarter of 2021 and down slightly on a year-to-date basis compared to 2021. Realizations this quarter were driven mainly by exits in our real estate equity funds, which has performed well and are now approaching the end of their fund life. Realized income for the third quarter totaled $243 million, up 22% year-over-year. After-tax realized income per share of Class A common stock was $0.75 for the third quarter, up from $0.62 in the third quarter of 2021 and well ahead of our declared dividend of $0.61. As we highlighted at our Investor Day last year, we have been meaningfully scaling our European waterfall funds over the past five years and many of the early funds are beginning to season. We continue to expect to ramp-up in their contribution to realized net performance income in the years ahead with accelerated growth thereafter as larger funds begin to contribute. In total, we have $105 billion in European waterfall style eligible funds, of which about $80 billion in credit or credit life funds, which we believe should build a growing base of more consistent net realized performance income in future years once we reach the harvesting periods for these funds. Looking at the realized performance income potential in our European waterfall funds over the next few years, we currently have approximately $20 billion in incentive generating AUM, primarily from funds that are out of their reinvestment period. In these funds, we currently have approximately $300 million of accrued and accumulated net performance income, and we expect to realize the vast majority of this amount over the next two years. We expect the recognition of this income to ramp-up over the coming quarters with roughly one-third in 2023 and then two-thirds expected to be realized in 2024. In the current fourth quarter, we are anticipating some early European waterfall distributions, totaling roughly $40 million in realized net performance fee income related to the strong returns in our funds this year. We continue to have significant value in American style waterfall funds that are eligible for realizations as well, where we're being patient due to the current softer realization environment and these private equity strategies. Our accrued net performance income, which includes both European and American waterfall style funds, increased 5.8% in the quarter to $888 million and is up nearly 10% year-to-date despite the difficult market backdrop. This increase was largely due to increases in EBITDA offsetting multiple compression in our private equity portfolio and rising interest rates and the credit portfolio, increasing the yield of those investments further in excess of the fixed hurdle rates of the funds. Turning to our AUM and related metrics, our assets under management totaled $341 billion, an increase of over 2% quarter-over quarter, and up 21% from $282 billion in the third quarter of 2021. Our AUM growth was driven by strong fundraising across the platform. Importantly, we generated these inflows with only $2.1 billion in closes this year from any of our five largest flagship funds as the expansion of both our product set and distribution channels continues to increase our fundraising capability. Going forward, our fundraising pipeline is as strong as Mike stated. The significant number of sizable flagships will have in the market is expected to set us up for an increase in fund raising for 2023 compared to 2022. Our fee-paying AUM totaled $219 billion at quarter-end, an increase of 3.5% from the second quarter and up 27% in the third quarter of 2021. Our growth in fee-paying AUM was primarily driven by deployment in our direct lending, alternative credit, real estate debt, and special opportunity strategies, which are all paid on invested capital. Having significant amount of dry powder, should be highly advantageous as we navigate future volatility. As of September 30th, our available capital totaled nearly $88 billion, and we ended the quarter with over $45 billion AUM not yet paying fees available for future deployment. As a result, we remain well positioned to capitalize on current market dislocations. Looking at our historical pace of deployment, we have generally deployed our available capital over an 18- to 24-month period. However, we recognize that periods of extreme volatility can impact our deployment pace. Finally, our incentive eligible AUM increased by over 15% year-over-year to $198 billion, of this amount $66 billion was uninvested at quarter end, which represents a meaningful amount of potential future value creation opportunities for us. So in summary, we believe the combination of this available capital with our management fee and FRE rich business in asset-light balance sheet, positions us well in this uncertain environment. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Mike for his concluding remarks. Hi Craig, it's Jarrod. Thanks for the question. I think the way you'd want to think about it is, and we've talked about it a lot - it will track similar to how management fees also. As we deploy, we earn more management fees. In this case, that's what we think so exciting about these European waterfall style funds is that as the subsequent vintages have been raised larger and as they're deploying, they're often deploying at a yield on the individual assets above the hurdle rate. So they're building that pre-balance over time. So we actually expect a steady and growing balance of accrued related to these, European style waterfall and that it would continue period-over-period, much like management fees do. It's something we'll continue to monitor, certainly. However, as you know, being a balance sheet like manager, we pride ourselves on our flexibility and our ability to take advantage of different markets and opportunities. And I wouldn't want to guess what might be available to us as these really come on in earnest, and I'd want to maintain our flexibility in regards to that. So if there was an acquisition opportunity or organic growth opportunity that, that cash would be well suited to investing, I wouldn't want to take that opportunity away. But it's certainly something that we'll always be aware of as we're mapping out what our dividend will be. Yes, to be clear, the REITs are in [FRPR], and they're not included in our accrual. The other amount that comes into FRPR - is the perpetual capital related to the credit funds. We have about $10 billion of AUM, and we had about $10 billion last year as well. There's a couple of factors to take into consideration there, which is, you have the rising interest rates that benefit it, but credit spreads, as they widen within a given year, they can be a little bit of a drag. So I think, all in, when you consider what we have from the REITs and what you have from the credit side, that we'd expect that number to be slightly larger than it was last year. But overall, there's a lot of inputs that will go into it in the fourth quarter in terms of what credit spreads are doing, what interest rates do and as well as the fair value of the assets of the REIT. And in terms of the realization that we had, the realization that we had - the realization that we had or that we mentioned there of $40 million, that's really related to our European-style waterfall that pay periodically in order to make certain tax payments that are required by those funds. It's not the start of the European waterfall in earnest, which we really look to 2023 and 2024 for. Jarrod here. Just to clarify that, if you look at which funds we referenced were in that pipeline, the bulk of those are our largest credit funds which pay on deployment. But one that is not is our seventh corporate private equity fund which pays on committed. So to the extent that that is successful in 2023 in raising, you will see a step-function margin improvement in that particular part of the business.\nGerald O'Hara: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then just as a follow up, I just kind of reading headlines this morning, you kind of see the term golden age for private credit. And clearly, you all are at the forefront, but as I sort of think about to put myself in the shoes of perhaps and the dominant or pension plan allocator who's looking at public credits that are perceived at least with potentially less risk and now higher yield, how are the competitive dynamics kind of shaking out with your private credit opportunities versus other opportunities or fixed income products in the market?"

            "name": "Michael Arougheti",
            "content": "Great. Thank you, Carl, and good morning everyone. I hope you're doing well. In the face of geopolitical tensions and rising inflation, energy costs, and interest rates, our business continues to generate steady growth and deliver strong relative performance for our investors. During the third-quarter, we continued our strong growth in our AUM and fee-related earnings despite the challenging environment and a continued slowdown in overall primary market activity. Our suite of products continues to resonate with our investors as we raised more than $14 billion of gross commitments for the quarter, bringing the year-to-date fundraising total to more than $44 billion. We're pleased with the breadth of our fundraising activity to date, which only included $2.1 billion in fundraising this year from our largest commingled funds. The flexibility of our investment strategies is also reflected in our steady deployment, which remains strong and was relatively flat versus our activity levels a year-ago. These factors drove growth in our AUM metrics, management fees, fee-related earnings, and realized income ranging from 21% to 28% on a year-over-year basis. Before I walk-through some quarterly business highlights, let me start by framing why our business has been so resilient during volatile markets like we're in today. It all starts with our management fee-centric business, which provides a more stable realized income compared to more performance fee-based and balance sheet heavy business models. For example, on a year-to-date basis, we generated more than 90% of our total fee revenues from our management fees and over the same period 92% of our realized income was derived from our fee-related earnings. This rich mix of FRE based earnings has also been steadily increasing over the past three years. Another important component of our business is our asset-light balance sheet, with balance sheet investments representing less than 0.5% of our total AUM. In addition to generating strong returns on equity, this means that we're less susceptible to changes in-market values for risk assets, particularly during times of high market volatility. The structure of our AUM and long-dated and perpetual vehicles also provides insulation from client withdrawals. About 88% of our AUM and 95% of our management fees are from either long-dated funds or perpetual capital vehicles. And due to the long-term nature of this capital, we have not experienced significant redemption issues during volatile periods. This enables us to be patient investors and utilize the capabilities of our experienced teams and our significant dry powder to make new investments and to support portfolio companies during more difficult markets. We believe that the nature and mix of our AUM also provides stability. Approximately 60% of our assets under Management are tied to a diverse range of credit strategies. These credit investments provide protection from declines in valuation multiples during economic downturns since our credit positions are generally in the top half of the capital structures of our portfolio investments. In other words, across the spectrum of private assets, our AUM focus in credit is generally positioned to have comparatively less risk. We believe this also provides meaningful benefits to both our fund investors and to Ares stockholders during rising interest-rate environments, as more than 90% of our debt assets firm wide are floating-rate and can earn higher income as interest rates increase. As an example, ARCC reported on Tuesday that its core earnings would have been 8% higher at the prevailing short-term rates at September 30th been in effect for the entire third-quarter. As rates continue to increase, this should continue to enhance Ares Capital's core earnings as evidenced by the 17% year-to-date increase in ARCC's third quarter dividend, and it provides for the potential for increased ARRC part one fees as well, all else being equal. Across the rest of our asset mix, we believe that our growing AUM and real assets with investments in real estate sectors with strong rent growth and an infrastructure assets that have built-in inflation escalators will be well-positioned to perform in the current market environment. We also believe that our private equity business is also differentiated with its focus on resilient, less cyclical, higher growth industries along with its flexible capital strategy of deploying assets across debt and equity in distressed and other opportunistic assets. So turning to deployment. The current market environment is providing opportunities for us to continue to take market-share and be a consistent capital provider when other traditional providers and public sources are retrenching. Our significant dry powder and the flexibility of our strategy has enabled us to provide a variety of capital solutions to private companies or to play in liquid markets as relative value shifts. Our deployment for the third quarter remained strong at $18 billion, with more than $12 billion in our credit strategies during Q3. We actively invested across the credit spectrum, including take privates, add-on acquisitions, secondary market purchases, financing asset portfolios, and many other types of situations. Nearly half of our activity in our U.S. and European direct lending businesses combined in the quarter was tied to existing incumbent borrowers and our focus continues to be on larger upper middle market companies. In real assets, we selectively invested over $1 billion, primarily in our core real estate segments of industrial and multifamily, and we invested $0.5 billion across our infrastructure strategy. We also deployed over $2 billion in private equity across both our ASOF and ACOF strategies. Our special opportunities team is very excited about the opportunities being presented, particularly investing in high yielding debt in the more volatile liquid markets. Our secondaries group deployed over $500 million as they're seeing increasing transaction activity for both LPs seeking liquidity and GPs seeking additional capital for growth. And we'd expect secondary opportunities to gain momentum over the coming quarters as private equity investors and managers seek solutions for the capital allocation and balances that they're facing. We also invested $1.4 billion across Ares SSG and via our affiliated insurance platforms. There's been a lot of discussion in the market about the denominator effect in slowing allocations to alternatives by investors. Through the end of the third quarter, we have not experienced this to the same degree and we understand others have. Our leading floating rate credit strategies and real asset strategies also continue to resonate with investors as they are seen as either beneficiaries or insulated from some of today's market headwinds. Overall for the third-quarter, we raised $14.2 billion across more than 50 different funds and accounts with more than 90% of the direct capital derived from our existing investor base. One highlight for the quarter was our final closing of our inaugural sports, media, and entertainment fund at $3.7 billion in commitments within the fund and related vehicles. This strategy is a great example of how we can leverage our team and the advantages of our broad platform to create exciting new adjacent strategies for our investors. ASOF II raised $1.3 billion during the third quarter and just held its final closing at its hard cap of $7.1 billion, which is more than double the size of our inaugural fund from three years ago. At quarter end, our 10th U.S. value-add real estate private equity fund held its final closing at $1.8 billion, well ahead of its target and over 75% larger than its predecessor fund. And we're pleased to report that our infrastructure debt strategy is being well received as we closed on another $500 million, bringing the total amount of AUM to $3.9 billion for our fifth fund. We also increased our AUM in our first Australia and New Zealand direct lending fund as we continue to build out investment capabilities and capital in the Asia Pacific region. Within real estate, our fourth U.S. opportunistic fund, which was recently launched, has attracted significant interest from investors and is expected to hold the first closing in Q4. With a $3 billion target, we anticipate that the early closings will equal or exceed the size of the predecessor fund. Our perpetual capital funds also continued to see strong inflows. Our two non-traded REITs raised approximately $850 million of equity commitments during Q3 with approximately $100 million in redemptions. Overall, debt and equity commitments raised from perpetual funds totaled $4.2 billion during the third-quarter as perpetual capital increased 24% from the year ago period to $89 billion. We expect to add at least one wirehouse for non-traded REIT distribution during the fourth quarter with more expected next year. Our affiliated insurance company, Aspida, is beginning to gain momentum and at $1.2 billion of new annuities in the third quarter across its reinsurance platform and new retail platform that launched at the end of June. Aspida now has over $4.5 billion in AUM of which a little over 50% is now sub-advised by our own investment teams. We're also excited about the expanding opportunity set for our secondaries business. On November 7th, we'll be completing the final step of our integration process and fully transitioning the Landmark business to be referred to as Ares Secondaries to better leverage the platform and the strength of the Ares brand. We continue to invest heavily in the Secondaries Group by adding senior talent, including real estate capabilities in Asia Pacific, and our new revenue synergies are playing out as we expected. We plan to launch our third infrastructure secondaries fund and we expect to launch new strategies within credit and private equity secondaries. The retail private markets fund is also starting to see inflows pickup, and we're partnering with retail technology platforms to enable access on wirehouse platforms next year. Now, let me turn to the future pipeline. As discussed on our last earnings call, we were at the beginning stages of launching a significant fundraising cycle for a number of funds where the predecessor funds were among our largest commingled funds. In addition to our ongoing activities with perpetual funds, managed accounts, and our existing commingled funds we've had in the market this year, we have recently launched or expect to launch commingled funds in the next three months that will target more than $45 billion, inclusive of fund leverage. We continue to expect first closings of some of these new funds in the first-half of 2023. This $45 billion of target fundraising includes our two largest fund series, our sixth European direct lending fund, and our third U.S. senior direct lending fund, along with others including our second flagship closed end alternative credit fund, our seventh corporate private equity fund, our fourth U.S. opportunistic real-estate fund, our second climate infrastructure fund, and our third infrastructure secondaries fund. As the public markets continue to report losses across equities and fixed-income, our fund results were generally strong across our various credit, real estate, and private equity strategies. In direct lending, our senior direct lending and junior direct lending strategies generated gross returns of 1.4% and 0.3% for the quarter and 12% and 6.7% for the last 12 months respectively. European direct lending returns also held up well, totaling 3.4% in the quarter on a gross basis and 11% for the last 12 months. The European direct lending portfolio is benefiting from lower overall leverage, strong interest coverage, and generally strong covenant packages. Real estate continued its strong performance as our U.S. equity composite generated gross quarterly returns of 2.8% and 33.4% over the past 12 months along with increased NAVs for both of our non-traded REITs. Our focus on industrial and multifamily continues to generate strong performance based on the fundamental tailwinds for rent growth, generally in excess of inflation in these sectors. Our European real estate composite declined 1.8% growth for the quarter, but increased 9.4% for the trailing 12 months. Our private equity portfolio performed particularly well during the third quarter, despite the overall declines in the public equity markets. Our ACOF composite increased 2.7% growth in the quarter and is up 10.7% over the past 12 months, primarily driven by strong revenue and EBITDA growth across the portfolio, as we've invested behind resilient sectors with attractive secular tailwinds. Our special opportunities business continues to thrive in this environment, not only raising and deploying a significant amount of capital in the quarter but also generating strong Q3 gross returns of 4.1%. Over the past 12 months, ASOF I has generated gross returns of 9.8%. In secondaries where returns are reported on a one quarter lag basis, our private equity strategies declined 5.6% on a gross basis, largely related to currency depreciation related to our European assets. But over the past 12 months, the strategy is still generated a positive 14.8%. Real estate secondaries was very strong, up 6.4% on a gross basis in the quarter and up 45.4% over the past year. And now with that, let me turn the call over to Jarrod to walk through our third quarter financial results in detail and to provide an updated outlook. Jarrod? Thanks Jarrod. I believe our results underscore the durability and consistent trajectory of our business and our ability to take advantage of weaker competition during times of volatility and uncertainty. Over the past two quarters, the global equity markets declined more than 20% and banks and the liquid credit markets have been severely constrained. During this time, we've delivered strong relative investment performance across most of our funds, continued growth in AUM, management fees and fee-related earnings, and improved our operating margins even while continuing to scale our platform. While there are clearly challenges that lie ahead, we have a deep and experienced team that has demonstrated an ability to grow consistently through volatile markets. The combination of our experience, sizable platform, portfolio positioning, long-dated capital base, and ample dry powder, all provide us with the tools that we need to generate successful investment outcomes for our clients, which in turn we believe will drive successful results for Ares' stockholders. I'd like to end by expressing my appreciation for the hard work and dedication of all of our employees around the globe. I'm also deeply thankful to our investors for their continued support of our Company. And with that, I'd just thank you for your time today. And operator, could you please open up the line for questions? Thanks Craig. No, I think deployment can continue. As we talked about in the prepared remarks, Craig, the beauty of the platform is; one, it's diversified by asset class and by geography, and the bulk of our strategies have the ability to pivot into the liquid markets when we get into a volatile backdrop, move up and down the balance sheet. So not surprisingly, even when primary market slows, we still have the ability to deploy pretty actively, and that's showing up in the numbers. Thanks Craig. Sure, thanks, Alex. So good news, bad news is that the two non-traded REITs raised $842 million in the quarter, which was up from $818 million last quarter. And I think also importantly, those inflows came against some fairly insignificant outflows, which is what we saw last quarter as well. I think quarterly redemptions this quarter were about $85 million. And so I think we are outperforming the peer set, both in terms of the inflow and the net. That's the good news. The bad news, if you want to call it that, is we're actually still doing that with our existing selling group so all of that is same-store. As we talked about in the prepared remarks, we expect to add one-wire platform for the non-traded REITs by the end of the year, and have a pipeline of other partners that we would expect to bring online into the new year. Sorry, you just asked about product expansion. I think folks are aware we have our PMF product, which we referenced in the script as well. We're beginning to see inflows accelerate there. And we are in registration, as people know, with ASIF, our private BDC, which we are hopeful will be well received given our private credit franchise. My expectation is it will ramp from there. To remind folks, we talked at our Investor Day that prior to being onboarded onto the Ares platform, that distribution engine was originating close to $2 billion per year organic. We're obviously quickly getting to that level, but I think we went into this endeavor with a view that as we scale that we would be able to do better than that. So I think it is a very exciting baseline given how early we are in the underwriting [maneuvers] having started only at the end of June, but my hope and expectation would be that as we continue to scale the capital base, the speed of those numbers could grow. Yes, I think given the attractiveness of the deployment environment and the demand that we're seeing from our investors for some of our core credit fund, that's a reflection that we've actually pulled one of our flagships up in the fundraising queue to raise it earlier than we had originally anticipated. Yes, I think the good news is, the market is still fairly fragmented, but in my opinion beginning to consolidate, and it's consolidating with managers like Ares who have a couple of things going for them; one, a broad and diverse set of products that's attractive to the financial advisor and retail community; two, strong performance in those products; three, a commitment to distribution in education in that channel as evidenced by the 130 plus people that we have in and around our Wealth Management Solutions business; and four is a deep and long-standing relationship with the street and the wire platforms having raised and manage things like ARCC and ACRE and all work institutional funds that already sit in the hands of a lot of high-net worth clients. So there are others that have those competitive strengths but they are few and far between. And if you look at the published results of whose taking share, I think we are slowly creeping up the lead tables at the top in terms of those that are seeing incremental flows. I can't tell you exactly to be honest how an adviser in the field is choosing to put their client into these products, whether they're choosing an Ares real estate product alongside another competitive product, or they're choosing one. But if you look at the flows, they are broad-based, they are deepening. We're actually seeing the number of advisers that we're doing business with increasing. And we're actually seeing the average ticket increase. So the numbers would tell you that, even if the advisers choosing between competitive product, that we are actually doing business with more advisers to a larger dollar amount per adviser. Thank you. Hi Brian, we're fortunate that Scott Graves who runs that product is here with us, so I'll let him answer that. Sure, I'll remind you, and we really looked into this year, like I said, at the beginning of the year, that this was a year we'd be making investments in our people and our technology so that we could prepare for what we knew was coming pretty large fund raise cycle. So ultimately that fundraise cycle will take anywhere from a year in that range, and we'll still be hiring behind that. And then as we deploy that, the majority of those funds are earning management fees upon deployment. So that will, as you've noted, allow us to accelerate our margins. So if you look at and what we've laid out as our margin target of 45% plus. That's why we reaffirmed that in the script, and if we feel comfortable there, as this is an accelerant to that; the ability to deploy these funds will certainly be very margin-accretive. Yes, there's a lot to unpack there. So I'm going to try to be succinct, and if you want to drill down on any particular standing. First, you have to differentiate between performance of fixed rate, fixed income within traditional investor portfolios in the form of sovereign debt, investment grade debt, and high-yield debt. And obviously, when rates are going up, you have the dual impact of value declines in the existing book and increasing pressures at the company-level. So I think there's a, lot of folks that are just dealing with the rapid decline in values that has come with the rapid rise in rates. That actually makes private credit and other floating rate fixed income product all the more valuable and important to start to recoup some of those losses at this point in the rate cycle. So I think, first, I just want to make sure that we're differentiating that. The positioning between private credit and traditional fixed income is often balancing act. I think right now they're having two totally different experiences on either side of the house in terms of the rate move. In terms of private credit and its competitive positioning, and I think Scott hinted at this. Right now if you look at the traditional markets and their ability to provide liquidity to private companies, I don't know if we have a golden age of private credit going on, but we have a golden age in some respects of private markets in the sense that we have more companies in the private markets than we ever had before. They're staying private longer. Public markets are getting more and more concentrated. I think people are reevaluating the value of liquidity in the public markets. So there's more capital that is finding its way into those private markets and that maybe, I didn't see the headline what people are referring to. So again, that structural shift in the markets in the economy, right now the public markets for all intents and purposes are not opened as a provider of capital to growing private companies. The leveraged loan market is largely unavailable. The high yield market is largely unavailable. So from a competitive positioning standpoint, having the amount of dry powder that we have across the platform I think we feel great about the competitive positioning. We're in a position now to be one, if not the only type of liquidity providers that are active in a market like this.\nGerald O'Hara: Okay, that's perfect. Thanks for the color. Yes, I don't know if I would say that based on what we're seeing, and Mitch and Kipp are here with me as well, that we're seeing all-cash buyouts in the pipeline. I think what you may be referring to is, if you just think about what's going on in the private equity universe. Valuation multiples are obviously compressing, given the change in discount rate and against the rise in interest rates. There's a lot of price discovery happening in the market, in the primary market in terms of where transactions will clear. And I think the leverage providers like us have been pretty disciplined around where we're willing to attach from a leverage standpoint and at what price and what terms. So to the extent that there is a disconnect between the leverage finance markets and where a private equity buyer would like to clear a transaction, I think they will use incremental cash to bridge it. So maybe the way to think about is not all-cash but higher cash contribution in order to clear quality transaction in today's market, but I don't think that we're seeing a move to all cash. But to your point, is it good for private credit, I think the answer again in a market like this where liquidity sources are scarce, limited, and we're one of the few that have scale and flexibility, I think it's going to be a pretty good vintage course.\nFinian O'Shea: Thanks, that's helpful. Just a small follow. I think you mentioned the base rate impact would be another approximately 8% improvement for the fourth-quarter for performance. Is that the extent of it in the context of the today's LIBOR curve, or is there still a visible uptick into next year? Yes, so just to clarify that, 8% was just reciting what Kipp and Mitch and others have talked about on the ARCC call, which was all else being equal if we just enjoyed the in-place rise in rates, income would have gone up 8%. So the answer is, there is absolutely more to go to the extent that we have continued rate increases which we all expect. And the reason that we talked about the 8% is the way that these flowed through the portfolio companies and then ultimately into our portfolios is it backward-looking averages, and so it takes a couple of months to get the full effect of any rate increase. So if we maintain the current trajectory rate increases, you'll continue to see that phenomenon. And I think as Jarrod mentioned, most of the incentive fees that we earn off of our floating rate credit funds are against fixed rate hurdles. And so not only are we delivering higher ROE in distributions at the portfolio level to our investors, but it has a meaningful impact on the incentive fee-generating opportunity that we have in our credit book.\nFinian O'Shea: Thank you. Sure. So the way that we set up Aspida intentionally was to have side-by-side pillars of our organic annuities and life business next to our Aspida reinsurance business which gives us the opportunity to look at organic annuities distribution, flow reinsurance, and then inorganic opportunities all side-by-side. And what we are trying to do there is make sure that we understand the ROEs that we can generate in each of those opportunities as we use our capital. I think the good news is given the market right now that we're in, we are generating higher ROEs. I think that we originally underwrote just given where we're able to price liabilities against the assets that we're generating. So our view right now is all three of those are attractive and scaling. And the inorganic opportunities we've talked about are pretty significant and growing. We continue to see traditional insurance companies simplify their business models and look for either reinsurance partners or look to sales of portions of their business to folks like Aspida, so I think the inorganic opportunities as good as we've seen. In terms of balance sheet capacity, I would maybe just remind you, our view as a balance sheet light asset managers that we have been growing that platform largely with third party capital. And so while we made a significant upfront investment to get all the capabilities and talent around that business, the scaling from that formation moment has been largely done with third-party capital, and I would expect that to continue. Yes, I do. I think there are a number of catalysts that will bring assets into the market. The changing rate regime is one of them. So like I said. I would expect that the pipeline of inorganic will largely pickup over time, rates being one of the drivers. Great. Thank you. Sure. So the simple answer is, as we sit here today we are not seeing material, credit weakness in any of our credit portfolio. So you talked about ARCC. On our most recent earnings call, we highlighted that nonaccruals were low at 1.6% of the portfolio at cost, meaningfully lower at fair value. And if you look at that Company, it has almost 20-year history, the 10-year average was about 2.5%. If you look at our European direct lending investments, actually stronger fundamental performance in terms of interest coverage, leverage and some underlying metrics just based on how those portfolios were positioned going into the current environment. So again, very low nonaccruals and strong performance. And we see that in the liquid markets as well, right? If you look at coverage levels in the high-grade market, I think we're pushing 10 to 11 times interest coverage in high grade. We're at five to six times interest coverage in the high-yield market, well in excess of two times coverage in the loan market. So there's a lot to be concerned about on the forward trajectory for the global economy. But these portfolios are going into this uncertain period with a lot of fundamental strength and just given the interest rate environment that we were in, while the rate of change is significant, the absolute level of interest rates, at least until this point, has not shown up in any kind of portfolio distress. When will we see it you asked, I wish I had a perfect crystal ball to tell you. I do think that the European economies will have a different experience just given the structure of the economy, and how they're experiencing inflation versus how we are. But I'm not as anxious maybe as some of the public markets are indicating we should be just given the strength of the underwriting. And as I said in our prepared remarks, the bulk of these assets are controlled at the top half of the capital structure with a significant amount of structural protection around them and a lot of equity subordination from institutional equity providers that is there to help these companies get through uncertain times. So I think we are appreciative that we all should expect that it's going to become more challenging before it becomes less challenging. But going in with a lot of strength, and we're not seeing a lot of differentiation right now between the U.S. and Europe. Yes, I think we said it in the prepared remarks, I don't think that there's that much more to drill down on the - if you look at private equity in the ACOF funds, what that's a reflection of is the sectors that we are invested in, including energy, our higher growth, higher return on invested capital type businesses. And so, the pace of EBITDA growth across those portfolios, which was in the mid to high single-digits, outpaced the deterioration in valuation multiple. Same thing for our real estate business, as we talked about, given our rigorous focus on industrial and multifamily, we continue to see very significant increases in rents and lease rates, continue to see very healthy occupancy rates. So the fundamental performance continues to outpace any deterioration in value that's being caused by a shift in rates. In terms of credit, again, most of the credit portfolio, as you saw this with ARCC. Are modestly down on book value, largely as a reflection of the rate environment, but again, are growing through that. And don't forget the value of current income in this rate environment. So the way to think about the attractiveness of the private credit markets is, if you see a 300-basis-point increase in base rates, 150 to 200 basis point increase in spreads, you're accumulating a significant amount of excess return relative to where you were six to nine months ago. And so even if you are absorbing a decline in your NAV of 1% to 2%, the all-in return in those portfolios continues to be meaningfully positive, which is why I think it's so attractive to investors and is proving to be quite durable. So we're not really seeing significant underperformance on the credit side of the house. Sure, so a couple of comments here. One, we obviously are very actively engaged with these portfolio companies. One of the benefits of being in the private credit markets the way that we are as the lead agent lead investor, we're highly engaged, so yes, there is a fair amount of hedging that is going on in the underlying portfolios. Those will eventually roll off and/or become less effective than they were maybe six to nine months ago. But there are effective hedges in place that is muting the impact from a coverage standpoint at the portfolio company level. I just want to take a step back because usually when we're talking about future risk of recession and default rates, we're talking about it coming off of, to my earlier comment, much weaker fundamental performance and not really attributing it to a rise in rates. So one way to think about this is all of the value of the rate increases that is theoretically challenging the companies is coming to us. And now everybody is waiting to see if earnings decline. But as of now, all of that \"value transfer\" has come to us as a private credit owner, whereas in past cycles, you would have the opposite, that the bulk of the decline in credit coverage would be coming from earnings degradation that would be harmful to us as well as harmful to the equity. So now we get to go into this cycle to the extent that the company gets somewhat challenged from the combination of continued rate increases and earnings declines where we have the flexibility to work with our equity partners in those portfolios to resolve the liquidity needs of the company. And obviously, we've been doing this for a long time. That could take the form of increased interest, but increased noncash interest. It could take the form of structural accommodations. It could take the form of allowing cash to come into the business in the form of equity or subordinated debt below us. So there are a lot of tools that you will use as you're transitioning. But I think it's important that people appreciate, through the lens of the private credit, most of that value and yours to the benefit of the private credit portion of the capital stack sitting at the top half of the balance sheet. And is not that it's a good thing, per se, for the company, but it is a transfer of value from the company to the credit or from the equity to the credit. And that's generally how this has played out in past cycles as well. But we're still a long way from that. Like I said, there's a pretty significant amount of broad-based health across the portfolios. And while the rate increases have been significant, this market has thrived and flourished in a 5% base rate requirement before. So I think people need to have some historical perspective as well. I think in the U.S. book, it's about 30%. And in the European book, it's significantly higher than that. Sure. I don't think that we have any other event to say thank you for your continued support and your time today, and we hope that you have a wonderful end of the year and look forward to catching up around our fourth quarter earnings in the New Year."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to Ares Management Corporation's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, 28th of July, 2022. I will now turn the call over to Carl Drake, Head of Public Market Investor Relations to begin. Carl, over to you. \nCarl Drake: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today for our second quarter conference call. I'm joined today by Michael Arougheti, our Chief Executive Officer; and Jarrod Phillips, our Chief Financial Officer. We also have a number of executives with us today, who will be available during Q&A. Before we begin, I want to remind you that comments made during this call contain forward-looking statements, and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those identified in our risk factors in our SEC filings. Our actual results could differ materially, and we undertake no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Please also note that, past performance is not a guarantee of future results. During this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Please refer to our second quarter earnings presentation available on the Investor Resources section of our website for reconciliations of the measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Please note that, nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Ares fund. This morning, we announced that we declared our third quarter common dividend of $0.61 per share of our Class A, and non-voting common stock, representing an increase of 30% over our dividend for the same quarter a year ago. The dividend will be paid on September 30 to holders of record on September 16. Now, I'll turn the call over to Michael Arougheti, who will start with some quarterly financial and business highlights. \nMichael Arougheti: Thank you, Carl, and good afternoon. I hope everyone is doing well. Despite prevailing market volatility and economic uncertainty, our second quarter results demonstrate the resiliency and durability of our business, highlighted by strong growth across our AUM and fee-related earnings, as well as our ability to generate attractive fund performance for our investors. We raised $16.4 billion of new gross commitments, driving our AUM to $334 billion, up 35% year-over-year, and our fee-paying AUM was up 37% year-over-year. Our management fees continued their steady growth, up 41% year-over-year and our fee-related earnings growth was even better increasing almost 50% as we continue to gain operating efficiencies from our strong top line momentum. Our continued growth was driven primarily by our opportunistic and diverse investing activities, often taking advantage of the retrenchment of the banks, and the public markets to provide solutions to high-quality companies and asset owners. Our firm is structured to navigate volatile markets as we build large direct sourcing networks, coupled with flexible strategies that are able to invest across asset classes, geographies and markets. As we mentioned on previous calls, 2022 is the year, where we're investing in our front and back office platforms in advance of our expected growth in the years to come. Yet despite adding 200 professionals in the first half of 2022, and continuing to invest in systems and infrastructure to support future growth, our FRE margins expanded to a record 40.1% in the quarter. We recognize that investors and analysts have been concerned about the impact on alternative managers, from the more challenging market, and economic conditions, marked by high inflation, rising interest rates, and a possible recession. We believe that, our business and portfolios are well positioned to navigate these types of risks. In fact, we have a track record of accelerated growth during past periods of economic recession and market volatility. For example, we increased both our AUM and management fees at a compound annual growth rate of more than 25%, during both the global financial crisis of 2007 to 2009, and the volatility introduced by the COVID pandemic from 2019 to 2021. Our goal at Ares is to perform for our investors throughout market cycles and to be able to invest opportunistically and flexibly when other market participants won't or can't. To accomplish this, we've built our business to withstand market volatility across our AUM, our revenue mix, and the composition of our balance sheet. Approximately 64% of our invested assets are in credit investments, which provide protection from losses or declines in valuation multiples during economic downturns by generally being in the top half of the capital structures of our portfolio investments. While every cycle is different, I would note that the direct lending asset class outperformed other credit investments such as high-yield bonds, syndicated bank loans and investment-grade bonds during the past two full cycles, encompassing the Fed tightening, recession and recovery. Our credit portfolio also provides meaningful benefits to both our fund investors and Ares during rising interest rate environments as roughly 90% of our credit group debt assets are in floating-rate instruments. We would expect this to drive higher ARCC Part one and other credit-based incentive fees in the second half of this year. In fact, ARCC reported on Tuesday that, a full run rate earnings impact from the recent increase in base interest rates through the end of the second quarter, could have increased its second quarter core earnings by about 11%, and add an additional 100 basis point increase in base rates from June 30, could add a 17% increase from second quarter core earnings all else being equal. As you know Ares Management would see a corresponding increase in its ARCC Part I fees. Across the rest of our asset mix, we believe that our growing AUM and real assets, such as real estate and infrastructure will also provide meaningful inflation protection due to the built-in inflation escalators generally incorporated in these assets. Our private equity business is also differentiated with its focus on resilient industries, and flexible capital deployment across debt equity and even distressed assets which may protect our downside through dislocated markets. I would also note that the structure of our AUM and long-dated and perpetual vehicles also provides insulation. About 88% of our AUM and 95% of our management fees are from either long-dated funds or perpetual capital vehicles. Due to the long-term nature of this capital, we have not experienced significant redemption issues during volatile periods. This has enabled us to be patient investors and utilize the capabilities of our experienced teams to support portfolio companies during challenging times. Having significant dry powder and access to capital is also critical to success. At quarter end, we're well-positioned with over $90 billion of available capital of which $52.7 billion is not yet generating management fees, and available to support further FRE growth when deployed. Combining our significant dry powder with the flexible investment mandates of many of our funds, we expect to take further advantage of increasingly attractive opportunities that we believe will arise in the coming quarters as the competitive landscape potentially improves. We believe that our management fee-centric model also provides greater stability to our realized income compared to more performance fee-based and balance sheet-heavy business models. In the first half of 2022, 91% of our RI is derived from our fee-related earnings, and this stability in our earnings has been steadily increasing over the past three years. We have also consistently generated 83% or more of total fee revenues from our management fees. The final component of our model is our asset-light balance sheet where investments represent less than 0.5% of our total AUM. This means that we're less susceptible to changes in market values for risk assets. Putting this all together, we believe that Ares is well-positioned to continue its strong growth with our fee-related earnings and our common stock dividend increasing at least 20% per annum through 2025. From a fundraising perspective there's been a lot of discussion about the more difficult institutional fundraising environment caused by the denominator effect as the value of public equity and fixed income portfolios have traded off substantially. We have not seen this impact in our fundraising to-date and we feel very good about our future fundraising pipeline. During the second quarter, we continued to see strong demand across our investment groups raising $16.4 billion of gross commitments across more than 15 different funds and numerous SMAs, including more than $5 billion of capital raised in our perpetual capital vehicles. As we look forward in addition to our ongoing fundraising activities, we expect to begin another commingled flagship fundraising cycle with four of our largest fund complexes launching successor funds in the second half of this year targeting first closings in 2023. This includes our seventh corporate private equity fund, our sixth European direct lending fund, our second flagship closed-end alternative credit fund and our third U.S. junior capital direct lending fund. We also expect to follow up with our third US senior direct lending fund next year. We continued our momentum with retail investors in the second quarter raising over $1.6 billion in the retail channel. Our retail channel AUM now stands at $57 billion at June 30. With respect to Ares Wealth Management Solutions, we continue to expand in a variety of ways as we see a significant opportunity to gain share in what we believe is a multi-trillion dollar market opportunity just in the next several years. As a global leader in credit and real assets, we believe that we're uniquely positioned to gain share with high net worth investors through our growing suite of income-generating, less volatile non-traded alternative investment products. We've added a senior leader in Asia Pacific and we will be adding a senior leader in Europe shortly both of whom are focused on helping us expand our retail distribution globally. We're also adding additional resources to our 108 professionals globally expanding new products and increasing our distribution channels. We continue to make progress with our distribution here in the US market and we expect to add one or more new wirehouses for our non-traded REIT distribution in the second half of the year. And on the new product front, we launched a new secondary private markets fund with more than $250 million of capital during the second quarter and we remain on file with a new non-traded BDC. Our deployment activity in the second quarter highlights the power of the size, diversity and scale of the platform that we've built over the past several decades. Although private credit and private equity market volumes were generally slower in the second quarter, we had our second largest deployment quarter to-date as we stepped in to gain share in these large addressable markets. We invested $24.1 billion in the quarter, well ahead of the $16.3 billion that we deployed in the first quarter of the year. We saw strong deployment across our US and European direct lending businesses, totaling $7.7 billion and $3.8 billion respectively, as we focus on the expansion needs of our incumbent relationships and larger higher-quality companies, which saw access to private capital while banks retrenched and the capital markets were largely closed. We believe that this compelling environment could continue for some time as many banks and traditional capital providers are generally risk-averse during dislocated markets. In private equity, our special opportunity strategy was very active, deploying $1.7 billion in the quarter as the market environment opened up new opportunities. Of note, our ASOF team has one of the largest investment pipelines that they've seen to date, finding new opportunities in the liquid secondary market as well as a large pipeline of private opportunities in companies seeking creative capital solutions. Our alternative credit business, which also invest opportunistically in diversified portfolios of cash flowing assets also deployed $1.7 billion taking advantage of increased demand for private capital across their target sectors due to a pullback from traditional capital providers. Our real assets group deployed over $5 billion of capital including over $2 billion across our non-traded REITs and $2 billion in our other real estate funds largely maintaining our focus on industrial and multifamily assets. Our newly acquired infrastructure debt business was also active investing nearly $750 million of capital in the quarter. We invested over $800 million through our secondary solution strategy. Interestingly, some of the denominator effect issues I referenced earlier are creating an increased need for portfolio management among private asset owners, which we expect to contribute to an acceleration of secondary transactions. In terms of fund performance, results remained generally strong in the second quarter as cash flow growth trends continued and we didn't see meaningful signs of fundamental weakness in our portfolios. The standout performers for us in the quarter were our US real estate equity strategy, which generated gross returns in the second quarter and last 12 months of 5.1% and 54.9% and our European real estate equity strategy, which generated gross returns in the second quarter and last 12 months of 5.3% and 20.3%. Our non-traded REITs also continued to generate strong income and returns with second quarter net returns for AI-REIT of 6.3% and 3.1% for AREIT. Our US and European real estate portfolios continue to benefit from the overweighting of the best performing industrial and multifamily sectors with significant underweight in office, retail and hospitality. Of note, our $7.6 billion Ares Industrial REIT, which is a good proxy for our US industrial assets saw rent gains on new and renewal leases, up 42% on average in the second quarter and the portfolio was 99.5% leased at quarter end, illustrating the strong demand in the industrial real estate market. In AREIT, our multifamily portfolio generated rent increases on new leases of 21% and on renewing leases 18% during the second quarter. We are seeing cap rates moving higher albeit unevenly across real estate property types but portfolio cash flow growth remains a strong offset in our target markets. Within our significant funds in credit, our direct lending credit strategies continue to outperform liquid market alternatives. Ares Capital Corporation generated a net return of 1.2% in the second quarter and 13.4% for the last 12 months. Similarly, our two largest direct lending strategy composites in the US and Europe also had steady returns. Our US senior direct lending strategy had a gross return of 2.3% for the second quarter and 15.5% for the last 12 months and our European direct lending strategy generated gross returns of 2.6% for the quarter and 11.3% for the last 12 months. Our performance benefited from our floating rate portfolios, strong EBITDA growth and our credit selection in larger companies with a focus on defensive industries. Our private equity returns were also steady, driven by strong EBITDA growth in the second quarter, partially offset by lower equity multiples. Our corporate private equity composite generated gross returns of positive 1.5% in the second quarter and 14% for the last 12 months, while Ares Special Opportunities Fund I generated gross returns of minus 1.5% in the second quarter and 16.8% for the last 12 months. Our ACOF portfolio, particularly benefited from strong growth in healthcare services and our energy investments. Let me now turn the call over to Jarrod to walk through our second quarter financial results in detail and to provide an updated outlook. Jarrod?\nJarrod Phillips: Thank you, Mike. Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us. As Mike mentioned, our second quarter results highlight the resilient nature of our business model, our diverse deployment capability, the breadth of our product offering and our excellent long-term relationships with our investors. In the face of market volatility and ongoing economic uncertainty, we delivered robust growth in management fees, fee-related earnings and fee-paying AUM. Our fundraising also continues to be strong, with year-to-date gross inflows of $30 billion. In a softer environment for realizations, our management fee-centric business model continues to drive stability in our financial results. Our quarterly management fees increased 41% year-over-year to $525 million, driven by continued deployment and growth in our fee-paying AUM. As Mike highlighted, 95% of our management fees are derived from long-dated or perpetual capital funds. Our other fee income has also been growing reaching approximately $22 million in the second quarter slightly above the first quarter and more than triple a year ago. This increase was driven predominantly by property-related fees from our non-traded REITs in addition to our typical capital structuring and origination fees in certain of our direct lending perpetual funds. In the second quarter, we generated $219.8 million of FRE, an increase of 49% over the second quarter of 2021. As expected, we had virtually no fee-related performance revenues during the second quarter. We continue to expect 90% or more of our annual FRPR to occur in the fourth quarter. As of 6/30, the non-traded REITs had an accrual totaling $140.8 million of gross performance participation for Ares. As these funds pay on an annual basis this value is not included in our accrued net performance income or our fee-related performance revenues, since it remains subject to the fund's future returns. However, the first half of the year for these two funds was strong and sets us up well as we enter the back half of 2022. Our FRE as a percentage of realized income was 89% in the second quarter and over 90% year-to-date. Our FRE margin for the second quarter was a record 40.1% up slightly over the first quarter and up 150 basis points versus the second quarter of 2021. We continue to be on track to achieve our 45%-plus target run rate FRE margin by the end of 2025. Despite slowing transaction volumes as valuations recalibrated in the private markets we still generated over $26 million in realized net performance income in the second quarter, largely from credit and real estate. During the second quarter European waterfall style funds comprised 95% of our total realizations. Realized income for the second quarter totaled $247.2 million, up 19% from the second quarter of 2021 and up 37% when comparing year-to-date 2022 versus the prior year comparable period. After-tax realized income per share of Class A common stock was $0.74 for the second quarter, up from $0.64 in the second quarter of 2021 and well ahead of our declared dividend of $0.61. Our accrued net performance income declined 1% in the quarter to $839.5 million due to market value adjustments and realized distributions in the quarter, but was up more than 37% over the last 12 months. Given the largely floating rate nature of our assets and our credit funds as interest rates rise, we expect to see higher rates of return over our fixed hurdle rates in these funds. As we highlighted at our Investor Day last year we have a growing number of European waterfall funds that are seasoning. And we expect to ramp up in their contribution to realized net performance income in the years ahead with continued growth thereafter. Looking at the realized performance income potential in our European waterfall funds over the next couple of years, we currently have $13 billion in AUM primarily from our 2017 and prior vintage funds that are generally out of their reinvestment period and are expected to have only a few years remaining on their fund life. In these funds we currently have approximately $250 million of accrued net performance income and we would expect to ramp up the realizations of this accrued amount with the vast majority realized over the next 24 months. Of course we continue to have significant value in American style waterfall funds that are eligible for realizations as well, but the ramp in European style funds will be new for us. Turning to our AUM and related metrics, our assets under management totaled $334.3 billion, an increase of nearly 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 35% from $247.9 billion in the second quarter of 2021. Our AUM growth was driven by strong fundraising across the platform. Several notable fundraising highlights during the second quarter include $1.6 billion in new CLOs an additional $1.5 billion in debt and equity commitments to our inaugural sports, media and entertainment fund, $1.3 billion in inflows through alternative credit funds. Nearly $900 million across our secondary fund and nearly $800 million in our sixth European real estate equity fund and related vehicles another $700 million in our tenth U.S. value-add real estate fund and nearly $300 million for our sixth Asian special situations fund. Importantly, we generated these inflows without closes from any of our top five largest fund series during the first half of the year as the expansion of both our product set and distribution channels continues to increase our fundraising capability. In addition, in light of the recent market volatility, strong client demand and improving market opportunity our second special opportunities fund has increased its hard cap from $6.1 billion to $7.1 billion. And we have a strong line of sight to achieving the new hard cap and expect to close on an incremental $1.4 billion in the third quarter. Going forward our fundraising pipeline is very strong. And as Mike mentioned, we expect to launch four of our largest commingled fund series in the second half of this year, with first closes anticipated in 2023. I would note that the four predecessor funds raised approximately $30 billion of gross commitments. And we hope to build upon that amount. Our fee-paying AUM totaled $211.3 billion at quarter end, an increase of more than 6% from the first quarter and up over 37% from the second quarter 2021. Our growth in fee-paying AUM was primarily driven by meaningful deployment in our direct lending, alternative credit, real estate debt and special opportunity strategies which are paid as we invest.  With market volatility likely to be a constant theme throughout 2022 and 2023, we're well prepared to invest in this market dislocation. Our available capital totaled $91 billion and we ended the quarter with $52.7 billion of AUM, not yet paying fees available for future deployment. If deployed, this corresponds to potential annual management fees totaling $505 million, which represents over 25% of our last 12 months total management fees. Our incentive eligible AUM increased by 2% quarter-over-quarter and nearly 30% year-over-year to $195.1 billion. Of this amount, $69 billion was uninvested at quarter end which represents a meaningful amount of potential future value creation opportunities for us.  We believe our firm is well prepared for the likelihood of continued market uncertainty into the back half of the year. Our management fee-driven FRE-centric business model provides stability which is further supported by the expanding balance of perpetual capital and the long-dated nature of our funds protecting us from redemption pressures.  Our dry powder of $91 billion provides a significant opportunity to deploy in an increasingly attractive investing environment. Given our available capital position a growing balance of credit-focused European waterfall-style funds to help mitigate an uncertain realization environment and significant earnings benefits from rising interest rates, we believe we are well positioned to continue to generate strong results.  I'll now turn the call back over to Mike for his concluding remarks. \nMichael Arougheti: Thanks Jarrod. I believe our results reinforce the attractiveness of Ares' business model and the important role that private capital plays during times of volatility and uncertainty. As banks retrench and as the capital markets become less reliable, private capital providers like Ares step up, filling the gaps and regain market share. In our view this countercyclicality is an attractive attribute of our business model. So, while there are clearly challenges that lie ahead, we have long tenured teams with a demonstrated track record of growth through volatile markets and while every business cycle is different and this high inflationary environment is certainly new to our economy over the last four decades. Our experience sizable platform, portfolio positioning long-dated capital base and ample dry powder provide us with the tools that we need to generate successful investment outcomes for our clients which in turn we believe will drive impressive results for Ares' shareholders. Through these reasons that we remain confident in our growth trajectory including our longer-term AUM forecast of $500 billion or more by year-end 2025. I want to end by expressing my appreciation for the hard work and the dedication of our employees around the globe. I'm also deeply thankful to our investors for their continued support for our company. Thanks for your time today. And operator could you please open the line for questions.\nOperator:  And our first question today is from Craig Siegenthaler of Bank of America. Craig, your line is now open.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Good afternoon, Mike. Hope you and the team are doing well.\nMichael Arougheti: Thank you.\nCraig Siegenthaler: We wanted to start with investing. It was nice to see two back-to-back quarters of stronger deployments in credit. But can you talk about how spreads and yields on new originations today are comparing to last year across our US and European direct lending franchise? \nMichael Arougheti: Sure. It's hard to say exactly Craig because obviously as we're price discovering and structure discovery in the private markets a lot of it is where we attach and detach and generally where we're comfortable pricing risk. So -- but order of magnitude, if you were to look at the market today factoring in OID and credit spread adjustment and the new SOFR environment, first lien loans in the middle market are probably somewhere in the 500 to 550 range with 90 to 95 OID. So kind of pricing 7% to 875  all-in for first lien piece of paper. That's significantly wider than we saw coming into the beginning of the year. \nCraig Siegenthaler: And just as my follow-up on credit quality. How have you seen credit quality migrate across your US direct lending portfolios year-to-date? And any color in terms of nonaccruals, delinquencies, restructurings? And then a mini follow-up here but just as in the event of a covenant trip, if you've had any, what type of solutions have you been seeking year-to-date?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. Kipp's on the line. I'll answer that and Kipp if you have any color chime in because I thought that Kipp did a great job addressing this on the ARCC earnings call earlier in the week. But interestingly a lot of the anxiety that people are feeling right now is forward looking into the back half of the year because if you look at our private credit portfolio the same would be true as we said in our prepared remarks for our real estate and PE portfolios. The reality is, there's still a lot of good fundamental performance and strength. So with regard to private credit and US direct lending in particular, we talked about on the call a 16% year-over-year growth in EBITDA. So still pretty strong. Revenues are up. EBITDAs are up. And if you look at nonaccruals, nonaccruals at cost in the ARCC portfolio at the end of the quarter were 1.6% and significantly lower than that at fair value that's measured against, what would be a 10-year average of 2.5%. Now the same would be true, if you were to look at the liquid markets with the high-yield market at or near historical lows in terms of default rate. So obviously, we have to be measured as we think about credit performance going forward. But at least, as the book sits today still demonstrating a fair amount of credit strike. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Alez your line is now open. \nAlex Blostein: Yes, everybody. Good morning. Good afternoon. Mike, maybe just building on some of the credit discussion. I was surprised to see US direct lending and European direct lending performance being up over 2% in the quarter, relative to obviously the syndicated market being down but also some of your public peers in direct lending, some were challenging results. So maybe kind of help us bridge the gap of what drove the absolute positive returns, in a world with obviously wider credit spreads for the broader market. And as you think about deployment, in what sounds like is still a pretty robust backdrop with you doing larger deals in this environment, how are the terms changing? So I heard you on the yield and the spreads, but what kind of protections are you guys starting to build in more to make sure that the credits you're extending will protect you in case the environment deteriorates from here? \nMichael Arougheti: Yes. Thanks, Alex. That's a good question. So a couple of things. One, and this is true for the credit book. It's also true for PE and for real estate, where we've talked about the fundamental performance outpacing multiple declines or mark-to-market impacts from spread widening and that's an important thing to keep in mind. So again, if you have a book that's growing 16% deleveraging in high-quality companies that are outperforming, even as spreads widen the effect of base rate increases and spreads widening mitigates a little bit. Spreads blew out a little bit more post quarter end. So some of that may be timing. But if you were to look at the middle market index generally, for the quarter, the middle market index broadly was only down about 1%. So, I think it's important to keep in mind, when you see rapid valuation changes happening in the public markets debt or equity, some of that is attributable to a change in the discount rate. A lot of it is attributable to technical funds flow. And the reality is in the private markets. Multiples are holding up much better. And the market is just much more stable in terms of, flows and performance. In terms of credit protection, obviously, we're going from what was a very active deployment environment coming out of the pandemic in 2021 into 2022, moving from an issuer-friendly backdrop to a lender-friendly backdrop. So that shows up in spread and in structure. And so you'll see tightening happening Alex, in every part of the credit dock from number of covenants available nature of those covenants baskets, et cetera. And I would say generally, the more prolonged the potential for stress, the tighter the docs will get. \nAlex Blostein: Great. Thanks for that. And then the my second question, maybe just a follow-up around some of the comments you made around retail which sounds like the Wealth Management segment as a whole continues to be pretty strong. I think you highlighted $1.6 billion of retail flows in the quarter. Can you help unpack that a little bit in terms of, which products specifically comprise this $1.6 billion? And just what are some of the latest thoughts you're hearing on the ground from the wires and your distribution partners, given the retail channel has gotten a little bit softer overall from what obviously, was a very robust environment last year? \nMichael Arougheti: Yes. So, the majority of that was from our two non-traded REITs so about -- of that was from our non-traded REITs. We had close to $100 million through ATM equity issuance at ARCC and then we had about another $400 million, coming in through our diversified credit interval funds and some of the other funds that we're raising through the retail channel on the co-mingled side.  What we're seeing on the ground, it's interesting and it really depends on the product. We're not seeing a meaningful slowdown in growth right now month-over-month, which is we're happy to see that. We're also not seeing significant redemption. So if you look, at that $818 million of inflows an example into our non-traded REITs, I think we had redemptions to match that of about $38 million. I think that's a commentary on the positioning of some of those funds. In terms of the performance, the full cycle investment strategy the lower leverage and the yield. But I think the appetite in that channel continues to be really strong across the board, for some of this alternative product. The other advantage we have, is we continued to invest as frankly despite the growth that we're experiencing we're underpenetrated, with some of these products across the wires. And so as I said in my prepared remarks, we would expect to add one or two new wires in the back half of the year, for the non-traded product, which is generally going to give us a little bit more organic growth opportunity just as we broaden out that distribution. So at least from our perspective what we're seeing on the ground is the demand is there. I think the secular trend is intact. And the redemptions are lower than I think some of our peers have seen.\nAlex Blostein: Great. Thanks so much again.\nMichael Arougheti: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Gerry O'Hara of Jefferies. Gerry, your line is now open. Gerry O'Hara of Jefferies, your line is now open. Your question.\nGerry O'Hara: Great. Thanks. Sorry about that. I appreciate the color on the floor. Flagship is expected to enter the market here in the back half of 2022 and I guess early 2023 become fee-paying. Jarrod, perhaps you could give us a little sense of how we should think about kind of the trajectory on the FRE margins that would be associated with this onboarding of fee-paying AUM given that we're still quite a bit of ways away from your longer term 2025 target? Thank you.\nJarrod Phillips: Sure. Thanks. Good to hear from you. And I think taking a look at those coming online, obviously, as we've talked about it's not just those that give us tailwinds in terms of our margin expansion but it's also the undeployed AUM that models out to about a little bit over $500 million of management fees that will come on as we deploy that AUM. Both of those things working in conjunction, help us to reaffirm that target that we laid out there of 45%-plus by 2025. So I think we continue to be well on pace for that this quarter. We have seen a little bit of expansion in our G&A expenses as we saw return to more normal travel behavior. And I expect that we'll see a little bit of that as we go here over the quarters. And as Mike mentioned in the prepared remarks and we've talked about before, we really view 2022 as a year where we're hiring and building up the platform for that $500 billion plus AUM business that we expect to have in the future that we laid out at our Investor Day. So it's certainly a tailwind to it. It's -- as you know it comes on at deployment not at committed. So that will help the margin, but it will expand over time and kind of reaffirm what we've laid out in the past.\nGerry O'Hara: Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess Mike maybe one for you as well. I think we're all grappling with how to evaluate ESG as it kind of is an overlay or getting built into the investment process. But maybe you could give us a little bit of a reminder as to what the targets if any are for Ares as a whole, or just maybe how you're thinking about the evolution into the investment process? Thank you.\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. Happy to Gerry. Just to clarify when you mean targets, can you just expand on what exactly you'd like me to comment on? I'm happy to.\nGerry O'Hara: Well, if there's any targets that have been put forth either at a company level or within your portfolio of companies that would be helpful. And if they are not specific targets just sort of an overall approach. Anything from a color perspective would be I think helpful?\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. I'll try to cover a very wide-ranging topic in a fairly concise answer here. We are very committed to best-in-class execution across all of our ESG activities. And the way that we think about positioning of ESG, number one we have an ESG group that reports directly into me. I think it's a demonstration of the strategic importance of that function as we continue to develop it over time. And that team at corporate is supported by, gosh, probably close to 100 what we would call ESG champions in the field that represent each of the investment and non-investment functions as they think about embedding ESG best practices into their business. The way we think about it in a simplistic framework is corporate sustainability is one pillar of our ESG framework and that's where we basically are looking at all things Ares as it relates to ESG. So what's our carbon footprint? What can we do to improve? And so on and so forth. With regard to targets there, we have not made any kind of net-zero commitment. But I think over time we likely will. We just put out our first TCFD report about a month ago in our second corporate sustainability report. So if you want to dig in, you can see some of the goals that we're setting for ourselves there and that will give people a general sense for the road we're on. We marry corporate sustainability initiatives with what we broadly call our responsible investment initiatives and that's where we're embedding ESG practices into our due diligence portfolio management and investing activities that is quite robust and is becoming more developed. Obviously, there's a significant amount of investor demand to see progress along that framework. So I would expect to see a number of our funds in the market and coming to market to designate articulate in Europe and I think you'll begin to see other products coming online in the near future, not the least of which is for example our climate infrastructure fund, which just by its very nature is right in the heart of the energy transition and all things ESG. We have been leading in our private credit business as a very significant provider of sustainability-linked loans into the private market across the franchise. And as a borrower, we've also been a pretty significant user of SLLs in our own borrowing. And so, we're trying to lead by example in the private credit markets as well. So, this is a long multiyear journey, Gerry, but we've got it very well resourced. We've got a significant operating plan in place and I think we're executing well against it.\nGerry O'Hara: Appreciate the color, and apologies for the broad-based question. But, thank you.\nMichael Arougheti: No, no worries. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad you brought that out. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from the line of Patrick Davitt of Autonomous Research. Patrick, your line is now open.\nPatrick Davitt: Good afternoon, everyone. So there's some press reports the last couple of weeks suggesting that some of the large private credit managers are dialing back on deal financing risk on direct lending. You obviously reported a pretty meaningful uptick there in 2Q. So through that lens, could you speak to how you're balancing the increased credit risk versus deployment opportunity dynamics, and how you see that flowing through to continued deployment here in the second half?\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. I think we have to differentiate between dialing back when we talk about deployment and dollars invested versus dialing back in terms of credit selectivity, structuring and pricing discipline, et cetera. So, we are absolutely dialing back as well in terms of our expected return for the risk that we're taking and the structure of that risk. It's not showing up in the deployment numbers, because we are the largest player in the market with a broad global footprint and the ability to play up and down the capital structure in different geographies and industries. So, what you don't see in those numbers, is actually more selectivity, more structuring and pricing discipline and more price discovery as we work through the available pipeline. The other thing keep in mind, and I referenced this in the prepared remarks is, the banks are obviously retrenching. They're dealing with a fairly sizable I wouldn't say catastrophic in any way, but fairly sizable inventory of unsyndicated exposure. That's obviously having them reduce risk appetite. The capital markets are challenged right now. So, when we get into that type of environment, we tend to see larger higher quality borrowers that otherwise would have gone into those markets come direct to the private credit market and effectively expand the addressable market opportunity. So, that's part of, I think, what is driving the numbers in the quarter and should into the back of the year. One thing I would highlight, when you look at our deployment numbers, we did make a meaningful acquisition of a middle market portfolio from annually in the quarter about $2.4 billion. So that skews the numbers slightly in terms of the deployment when you're just thinking about new issue volumes versus secondary. So, I would say we are being more selective. We're being more demanding. Dialing back, I'll leave it to you as to kind of how you want to define that. But I absolutely think you're supposed to be more measured in the market that's transitioning the way that this one is.\nPatrick Davitt: Very helpful. Thanks. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all for me.\nMichael Arougheti: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Finian O'Shea of Wells Fargo. Finian, your line is now open. Please proceed.\nFinian O'Shea: Hi, everyone. Good afternoon. Question on the fundraising headwinds. We're not seeing that in the large alternative managers as you noted. But are you seeing any fundraising challenges within middle market private equity through your lens of the direct lending business franchise? And if so, how do you see that impact playing out?\nMichael Arougheti: Yeah, Hi, Fin. It's a good question. I think the simple answer is yes. And we talked about it in the prepared remarks, which is everyone refers to denominator effect. But it's really a combination of numerator effect in 2021 and denominator effect in 2022. So, if you just look at it, generally speaking, over the last three years, we had very significant deployment -- probably accelerated deployment coming out of the heart of COVID, which had a lot of private equity GPs coming back to market earlier than they otherwise expected on the heels of significant performance, 40% 50% 60% type rates of returns last year. So, going into 2022, I think a lot of institutional investors were at or near their full allocation for regular way private equity. And then, the denominator effect kicks in, which makes that full allocation start to feel like an over-allocation. Again, as I said in the script, I think it's largely for the time being a private equity phenomenon and what winds up happening in markets like that is fundraisings get drawn out, as people resolve their allocations and available capital. And then, I think other solutions for liquidity kick-in. So secondary, as an example should actually see an acceleration in demand both from LPs and GPs as people are trying to manage through the current liquidity environment. And I think creative private credit solutions the likes of which we provide through our special ops teams, our alternative credit teams, and our direct lending teams will also become a bigger factor as people are owning companies longer. So, you referenced the larger platforms. We've been talking about this for years. If you think about the secular growth trends and also growing across the broad spectrum but the larger platforms are growing at a minimum 2x the market growth and just capturing more share of wallet and I think that will continue to accelerate, particularly in a market like this where I think LPs that are potentially over-allocated or at allocation will likely lean in on some of the more strategic GP relationships. So, the interesting thing about our business is positioned on either side of that, right? So, if you see a modest slowdown in primary LBO activity in the middle market, you're going to see a pickup in structured debt and equity investing to resolve the in-place book of business as well as likely a ramp in secondaries. But again, I don't think that there's anything problematic about it. We've seen it before and I think it will resolve itself. But it's definitely leading to slower fundraising for regular way PE at least in the early part of this year. \nFinian O'Shea: Thanks. That's helpful. And just a follow-up on real estate continuing to do very well there's very strong pricing as you outlined. Can you talk about how much as you see it how much this phenomenon has played out in terms of pricing gains as leases roll over? How will it go for the rest of the portfolio and perhaps in the future? \nMichael Arougheti: I think Bill Benjamin; our Global Head of Real Estate is on. I'll let him if he is -- give you his views and I can chime in with some color to the extent I have anything to add. Bill are you on?\nBill Benjamin: I'm on. Thanks Mike. Across our industrial portfolio, we believe and this is about an 80 million square feet or more that our leases in place are 20% below market. And it might even be more so on the Tier 1 coastal markets. So, there has been yield expansion, prices are softening, but there's a lot of inbuilt rental growth in our existing portfolio. And in addition in multifamily, our second largest holdings, we are seeing new leases again at double-digit increases to outgoing leases whether it's an incumbent tenant or a replacement tenant for vacancy. So, we feel the rental story in our two major asset allocations is very much intact which will support values even as cap rates rise. There will be a moderating. We hit 2021 was a 20% year 20% growth in asset values in the major markets. We don't see that being sustained by any sense. But rents will support the values we have. And we continue to be underweight the very challenged sector of office. We're seeing some come back in retail, but we only have small holdings there. \nMichael Arougheti: And one thing I would also maybe just to add -- one quick addition which I think is just important for people to keep in mind. If you think about past real estate cycles and where we've seen distress, they've largely occurred in markets and situations where the market was oversupplied. We are in exactly the opposite situation. So, even before we got into supply chain constraint we were in an appropriately if not undersupplied market. When you factor in supply chain constraints and inflation on raw material inputs the time to deliver new product into some of these undersupplied markets and the cost to deliver product into these undersupplied markets obviously makes the value of the in-force real estate just that much more attractive. So, it is a slightly different dynamic that exists today in most of the markets that we play in that I think people are used to seeing through the lens of historical cycle. So it's also less leverage. We're seeing less for selling. So there's just a lot more stability in the market than we would have seen in prior cycles. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question of the day comes from Robert Lee at KBW. Robert, your line is now open, would you like to proceed?\nRobert Lee: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking the questions and answers. I know it's still a small business and really just getting off the ground. But can you maybe update us a little bit on the speed? I believe it was this year it was going to -- you had mentioned it was talked about starting to actually originate and underwrite business and it's certainly a pretty strong environment for fixed annuities given the rate environment. So, you maybe just update us on progress there maybe how we should think about that maybe starting to contribute to asset growth?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Rob. So we obviously showed folks a high-level view of growth expectations at our Investor Day. And I would say we are still on that trajectory. You do have a good memory, we said that we would expect that we would begin the organic distribution of our annuity product this quarter and we did in fact doing that. So that machine turned on about a month ago and now we're starting to ramp that.. Importantly too, our reinsurance business is growing. I think at our Investor Day we talked about roughly $1 billion of reinsurance flows. That number is now $2 billion. So we're seeing good growth with the existing scenic relationships as well as the addition of new relationships, and we continue to have success on raising behind that growth largely with third-party capital. So we have hit a couple of those important milestones that you referenced in terms of turning on the organic growth engine and the capital raising and are absolutely on plan with the path that we laid out at the Investor Day. \nRobert Lee : Great. And then maybe just a follow-up. You've talked about this in the past. I mean, obviously, the last couple of years, you've significantly expanded the business through acquisitions. I know you've talked about there being a higher hurdle to future acquisitions. But just given the environment maybe some managers having a little bit more issue raising capital with -- they had some good products. I mean, do you see anything that may create opportunities over the next 18 months or so if this environment unfortunately continues, or how are you thinking about that potential use of capital?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, it's a good point to make, because when we were talking about acquisitions prior to this bad market volatility, it was obviously largely about identifying large addressable markets, where we felt like we could bring some kind of strategic advantage to. And just as a quick aside, the acquisition integration and growth strategy, it's been going exactly as we hoped it would. And so the combination of the Black Creek acquisition Landmark and the AMP debt are all, I think, we're pleased to have them on the platform going into this environment. We have seen in the past just, as a reminder, if you look at the GFC we acquired Allied Capital in 2010 and the reverberations of the GFC, we acquired ACAS, we had a number of tuck-in CLO manager acquisition. So our historical experience would tell us that when you see distress in the market in smaller less well-capitalized managers that are either having balance sheet issues or personnel issues, we'll look to transact. And so I would expect that that would happen again if this market persisted. It's still too early Rob to see that flow. It usually first shows up frankly as portfolio acquisition opportunities or portfolio acquisitions with small team lift outs as opposed to platform trades. But if it persists and is prolonged I would expect to see some things get catalyzed and I would expect that we would get calls on those, but I think that's still a ways away.\nRobert Lee : Great. That's all I had. Thanks for taking my questions today.\nMichael Arougheti: Thanks, Rob.\nOperator: Thanks. And our next question is from Adam Beatty of UBS. Adam, your line is now open.\nAdam Beatty : Thank you and good afternoon. I wanted to ask about competition in terms of deploying capital in two areas: direct lending and real estate. On the direct lending side, it sounds like banks kind of pulling back has given you an opportunity, maybe for some new issuer or borrower relationships. I'm just wondering, how much competition you're seeing there obviously not from banks, but maybe from other alternative managers or what have you? And also in real estate the themes of kind of multi-family, industrial logistics are pretty familiar. So just wondering as you go out for those assets the competition, you're encountering in that area and how you're dealing with it? Thank you.\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. I'll give a general overview for both, because I think the answer is the same. And I apologize for kind of grossly oversimplifying. But we just finished talking about the consolidation of dollars with fewer managers. The reality is as that continues to play out large players like us have come to realize that scale is a huge benefit and driver of positive investment outcomes and growth. And the reason is, we just frankly have more people against more markets with a better toolkit that's more relevant to more people in the market. And so we're capturing disproportionate share. And so the origination engine is a huge advantage. The capital scale and flexibility is a huge advantage. The portfolio management investment is a huge advantage. The information that we're able to pull across all these different markets. So the simple answer is, while there's always competition, the larger we get, the more entrenched our relationships become, the more we're able to outcompete people for higher-quality assets. And that's true in direct lending and it's true in real estate, in a market that is consolidating, whether you're talking about brokers, banks, sell-side advisers, they're consolidating as well. And I think that means that, while there is continued flows into the market, I would expect we'll see just a disproportionate share of that flow and disproportionate share of the investment opportunity. Direct lending is a little bit unique relative to real estate in the sense that, as a lender, versus an equity investor, we're able to monetize incumbent relationships within the portfolio much more actively. So if you look at our private credit books, 50% to 60% of our deal flow is typically coming from incumbent borrowers. As we continue to build specialty lending verticals like technology, software, sports media and entertainment, life sciences, they start to grow the non-sponsored side of the business, which is also a way to mitigate any marginal competition that we feel. So we're seeing over half of our flow in largely noncompeting situations just monetizing the existing relationships we have. On the equity side, when we talk about real estate, we don't have those incumbent lender relationships. We have those incumbent broker, operating partner, bank relationships that also drive disproportionate flow. And I think we're not alone in that. I think the other large-scaled alt managers would tell you that they're having a similar experience.\nAdam Beatty: Got it. Makes sense. Thank you, Mike. And then just one quick follow-up on -- you talked a little bit about the potential increased opportunity for secondaries, given need to rebalance, reallocate, manage portfolios and what have you. And not to be hopefully too picky, but the way you phrased it with a little more future tense than I might have expected, like, sort of expect to contribute. And I might have thought that it would already sort of be quite active. So maybe I'm just picking on your words, or is it that there's demand, but the deals haven't come together yet? Just, how are you seeing that? Thanks.\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. No, I appreciate it. I don't think you're picking on my words. It's actually, it's both, right? So when we talked about the opportunity in secondaries leading up to this year, we were talking about a broad secular growth theme, which was being driven by a move from LP-led deals to GP-led deals, globalization of the business and move away from private equity transactions into real assets and credit. So there's this broad overarching secular growth trend which is still intact. What I was really referring to now is, there should be an accelerated cyclical growth opportunity because of this issue of overallocation in certain pockets of the market. And so, both for LPs looking to free up liquidity to invest into this vintage, or GPs who need to extend the life of their existing portfolios, I think, you'll see secondaries both on the LP side and the GP side benefit. So I think, for me, it's not picking the words. It's really secular versus cyclical. I think, now we have a cyclical opportunity that we'll just amplify the secular trend that we've been talking about for the last couple of years.\nAdam Beatty: Got it. So a couple layers there. Thank you. Mike. Appreciate it.\nAdam Beatty: Sure. You got it.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question of the day is from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Michael, your line is now open, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to proceed with your question.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a quick question on the AMP and infrastructure debt platform. I'm just hoping you could update us on the progress of the integration, how that's progressing and what sort of initiatives are underway to meaningfully scale that business. Thank you.\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. We can't comment on any specific fund raise, but what I will say qualitatively is, the integration could not be going any better. As we talked about when that acquisition was made, what we loved about it was, we had a market-leading team that was already scaled with an institutional quality track record and investor base. And the opportunity to come here was to accelerate fundraising, continue to invest in growth of the platform in new parts of the capital structure and new geographies and then, to begin to leverage some of the synergies that exist with other parts of the Ares Infrastructure business. And all of that is happening and the integration collaboration has been fantastic. So we've got really good fundraising momentum. We are adding people in new geographies, making increased investments in the European market, continuing to scale our presence in APAC and just going to be happier with the way that's going. And we'll be in a position I think to update people on the fundraising progress that we're making there next quarter.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Kenneth Lee of RBC. Kenneth, your line is now open.\nKenneth Lee: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just one on the fundraising for the four commingled funds in the second half. I think in the past, you've mentioned that, typically you would see anywhere from 20% to 40% in terms of upsizing for successor funds. Just wondering, if you would expect similar ranges for these four? Thanks.\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, Ken. I mean, that would be our hope. But I just want to highlight, these four funds, obviously, they're very meaningful flagship credit funds. And if you look at the sequential growth of the prior vintages, it's been within that range, if not better. I'm less focused on fund size and fund growth here because all of those fund products actually pay on deployment. So I think the reality is whether we grow 20%, 40% or 50%, the value contribution is going to come from bringing that liquidity on and deploying it. So yeah, we hope to see them grow consistent with our past experience, but we don't need them to grow in order to continue to deliver the types of growth rates that we've articulated to all of you.\nKenneth Lee: Got you. Very helpful. And just one follow-up if I may, just back on direct lending. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about what trends you're seeing within Europe and Asia and whether there are any differences than what you're seeing in the US on the direct lending side? Thanks.\nMichael Arougheti: Yeah. I mean, Europe I would say we're seeing similar trends to what we're seeing here in terms of bank retrenchment and challenges in the capital markets. Our competitive position in Europe, frankly is probably stronger, not to say that we don't have a leading US franchise as well, but we just have much less consistent scaled competition in that market. So I would say while the trends in terms of the ecosystem around us and the investment opportunity I would say that from a competitive dynamic standpoint, there's just less competition there and I think we've been demonstrating that market leadership is pretty valuable. On the Asia side, I think you have to think about it by region in our what I would call more regular way acquisition finance business in developed Asia, largely focused on Australia and New Zealand. That continues on a good growth trajectory and is seeing similar trends to what we're seeing in other parts of the developed world. When you start to talk about what we're seeing coming out of developing Asia slightly different. Those capital markets are pretty volatile right now, you're dealing with challenges in the China bank and bond market. You've got some regional economic issues with a slow recovery from COVID. And so that set up is different here. And obviously the direct lending market in Asia Pacific generally is just much less developed much less evolved and much less scale than this year. That's what we're excited about. But at the same time, the way that the market is developing there, it's probably a little bit more challenging from a pure direct lending standpoint than the US and Europe is.\nKenneth Lee: Got you. Very helpful. Thanks again.\nMichael Arougheti: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer. Chris, your line is now open.\nChris Kotowski: Yeah. Good afternoon. Thanks. In your recent developments on Page three of the deck, you noted the launch of Ares Private Markets Fund. And I wonder can you just flesh that out a little bit in the target audience for that fund and how you're marketing it and to the extent that you can the fee structure and ultimate potential target size?\nMichael Arougheti: Yeah. So that is a -- we referenced it in the prepared remarks. That's actually a retail-oriented fund that we launched this quarter with $250 million of seed capital from Ares and two of our strategic investors. Similar to our other retail-oriented product, we would expect that it will get raised through a combination of distribution through the RIA and wirehouse channel. It is focused on the private equity side of the market. So if you think about our broad product offering on the retail side, we have our non-traded REIT product to deliver a broad exposure to our real estate capabilities. We have our diversified credit tangible fund to give people access to our broad-based credit expertise and this is really an opportunity for people to get access to the private equity capabilities that exist here. The fund as it ramps will largely be focused on leveraging our secondary solutions business. But as it scales, the fund also has the ability to do direct private equity investing. And as the fund diversifies that's exactly what we would plan to do. So there's no real target per se seeing as it's a perpetual open-ended vehicle and we'll continue to ramp it the way that we've ramped our other non-traded product.\nChris Kotowski: So it's evergreen? And is there an incentive or carry component to it? And does that rely on marks, or is it kind of like some of the other retail closed-end vehicles that we see where it's three-year... \nMichael Arougheti: Yeah, it has both management fee and incentives. I don't have the terms of that fund in front of me. I don't know if Jarrod or anybody else does that they want to chime in if not we can get you that information off-line.\nJarrod Phillips: And Mike, I can give the numbers. That's a standard management fee of 1.4% generally across the share type and the incentive fee is based on profits, which includes your unrealized and you can find that in the entry document that's filed with the SEC.\nChris Kotowski: Okay. And we'll get those numbers quarter-by-quarter as that ramps up, right?\nJarrod Phillips: Yes, it will be -- it's excellent. Just like our non-traded REITs and our interval fund that will always have quarterly filings, public quarterly filings. \nChris Kotowski: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nJarrod Phillips: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And we have no more questions for today. So it's my pleasure to hand back to Mike Arougheti for any closing remarks.\nMichael Arougheti: Great. Thank you. Thanks for all the time today. Sorry, if we ran a little long, but we appreciate everybody's support and attention and hope that everybody gets a little bit of downtime this summer and look forward to talking to everybody next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our conference call for today.

            "name": "Jarrod Phillips",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us. As Mike mentioned, our second quarter results highlight the resilient nature of our business model, our diverse deployment capability, the breadth of our product offering and our excellent long-term relationships with our investors. In the face of market volatility and ongoing economic uncertainty, we delivered robust growth in management fees, fee-related earnings and fee-paying AUM. Our fundraising also continues to be strong, with year-to-date gross inflows of $30 billion. In a softer environment for realizations, our management fee-centric business model continues to drive stability in our financial results. Our quarterly management fees increased 41% year-over-year to $525 million, driven by continued deployment and growth in our fee-paying AUM. As Mike highlighted, 95% of our management fees are derived from long-dated or perpetual capital funds. Our other fee income has also been growing reaching approximately $22 million in the second quarter slightly above the first quarter and more than triple a year ago. This increase was driven predominantly by property-related fees from our non-traded REITs in addition to our typical capital structuring and origination fees in certain of our direct lending perpetual funds. In the second quarter, we generated $219.8 million of FRE, an increase of 49% over the second quarter of 2021. As expected, we had virtually no fee-related performance revenues during the second quarter. We continue to expect 90% or more of our annual FRPR to occur in the fourth quarter. As of 6/30, the non-traded REITs had an accrual totaling $140.8 million of gross performance participation for Ares. As these funds pay on an annual basis this value is not included in our accrued net performance income or our fee-related performance revenues, since it remains subject to the fund's future returns. However, the first half of the year for these two funds was strong and sets us up well as we enter the back half of 2022. Our FRE as a percentage of realized income was 89% in the second quarter and over 90% year-to-date. Our FRE margin for the second quarter was a record 40.1% up slightly over the first quarter and up 150 basis points versus the second quarter of 2021. We continue to be on track to achieve our 45%-plus target run rate FRE margin by the end of 2025. Despite slowing transaction volumes as valuations recalibrated in the private markets we still generated over $26 million in realized net performance income in the second quarter, largely from credit and real estate. During the second quarter European waterfall style funds comprised 95% of our total realizations. Realized income for the second quarter totaled $247.2 million, up 19% from the second quarter of 2021 and up 37% when comparing year-to-date 2022 versus the prior year comparable period. After-tax realized income per share of Class A common stock was $0.74 for the second quarter, up from $0.64 in the second quarter of 2021 and well ahead of our declared dividend of $0.61. Our accrued net performance income declined 1% in the quarter to $839.5 million due to market value adjustments and realized distributions in the quarter, but was up more than 37% over the last 12 months. Given the largely floating rate nature of our assets and our credit funds as interest rates rise, we expect to see higher rates of return over our fixed hurdle rates in these funds. As we highlighted at our Investor Day last year we have a growing number of European waterfall funds that are seasoning. And we expect to ramp up in their contribution to realized net performance income in the years ahead with continued growth thereafter. Looking at the realized performance income potential in our European waterfall funds over the next couple of years, we currently have $13 billion in AUM primarily from our 2017 and prior vintage funds that are generally out of their reinvestment period and are expected to have only a few years remaining on their fund life. In these funds we currently have approximately $250 million of accrued net performance income and we would expect to ramp up the realizations of this accrued amount with the vast majority realized over the next 24 months. Of course we continue to have significant value in American style waterfall funds that are eligible for realizations as well, but the ramp in European style funds will be new for us. Turning to our AUM and related metrics, our assets under management totaled $334.3 billion, an increase of nearly 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 35% from $247.9 billion in the second quarter of 2021. Our AUM growth was driven by strong fundraising across the platform. Several notable fundraising highlights during the second quarter include $1.6 billion in new CLOs an additional $1.5 billion in debt and equity commitments to our inaugural sports, media and entertainment fund, $1.3 billion in inflows through alternative credit funds. Nearly $900 million across our secondary fund and nearly $800 million in our sixth European real estate equity fund and related vehicles another $700 million in our tenth U.S. value-add real estate fund and nearly $300 million for our sixth Asian special situations fund. Importantly, we generated these inflows without closes from any of our top five largest fund series during the first half of the year as the expansion of both our product set and distribution channels continues to increase our fundraising capability. In addition, in light of the recent market volatility, strong client demand and improving market opportunity our second special opportunities fund has increased its hard cap from $6.1 billion to $7.1 billion. And we have a strong line of sight to achieving the new hard cap and expect to close on an incremental $1.4 billion in the third quarter. Going forward our fundraising pipeline is very strong. And as Mike mentioned, we expect to launch four of our largest commingled fund series in the second half of this year, with first closes anticipated in 2023. I would note that the four predecessor funds raised approximately $30 billion of gross commitments. And we hope to build upon that amount. Our fee-paying AUM totaled $211.3 billion at quarter end, an increase of more than 6% from the first quarter and up over 37% from the second quarter 2021. Our growth in fee-paying AUM was primarily driven by meaningful deployment in our direct lending, alternative credit, real estate debt and special opportunity strategies which are paid as we invest.  With market volatility likely to be a constant theme throughout 2022 and 2023, we're well prepared to invest in this market dislocation. Our available capital totaled $91 billion and we ended the quarter with $52.7 billion of AUM, not yet paying fees available for future deployment. If deployed, this corresponds to potential annual management fees totaling $505 million, which represents over 25% of our last 12 months total management fees. Our incentive eligible AUM increased by 2% quarter-over-quarter and nearly 30% year-over-year to $195.1 billion. Of this amount, $69 billion was uninvested at quarter end which represents a meaningful amount of potential future value creation opportunities for us.  We believe our firm is well prepared for the likelihood of continued market uncertainty into the back half of the year. Our management fee-driven FRE-centric business model provides stability which is further supported by the expanding balance of perpetual capital and the long-dated nature of our funds protecting us from redemption pressures.  Our dry powder of $91 billion provides a significant opportunity to deploy in an increasingly attractive investing environment. Given our available capital position a growing balance of credit-focused European waterfall-style funds to help mitigate an uncertain realization environment and significant earnings benefits from rising interest rates, we believe we are well positioned to continue to generate strong results.  I'll now turn the call back over to Mike for his concluding remarks. Sure. Thanks. Good to hear from you. And I think taking a look at those coming online, obviously, as we've talked about it's not just those that give us tailwinds in terms of our margin expansion but it's also the undeployed AUM that models out to about a little bit over $500 million of management fees that will come on as we deploy that AUM. Both of those things working in conjunction, help us to reaffirm that target that we laid out there of 45%-plus by 2025. So I think we continue to be well on pace for that this quarter. We have seen a little bit of expansion in our G&A expenses as we saw return to more normal travel behavior. And I expect that we'll see a little bit of that as we go here over the quarters. And as Mike mentioned in the prepared remarks and we've talked about before, we really view 2022 as a year where we're hiring and building up the platform for that $500 billion plus AUM business that we expect to have in the future that we laid out at our Investor Day. So it's certainly a tailwind to it. It's -- as you know it comes on at deployment not at committed. So that will help the margin, but it will expand over time and kind of reaffirm what we've laid out in the past.\nGerry O'Hara: Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess Mike maybe one for you as well. I think we're all grappling with how to evaluate ESG as it kind of is an overlay or getting built into the investment process. But maybe you could give us a little bit of a reminder as to what the targets if any are for Ares as a whole, or just maybe how you're thinking about the evolution into the investment process? Thank you. And Mike, I can give the numbers. That's a standard management fee of 1.4% generally across the share type and the incentive fee is based on profits, which includes your unrealized and you can find that in the entry document that's filed with the SEC. Yes, it will be -- it's excellent. Just like our non-traded REITs and our interval fund that will always have quarterly filings, public quarterly filings. Thank you."

            "name": "Michael Arougheti",
            "content": "Thank you, Carl, and good afternoon. I hope everyone is doing well. Despite prevailing market volatility and economic uncertainty, our second quarter results demonstrate the resiliency and durability of our business, highlighted by strong growth across our AUM and fee-related earnings, as well as our ability to generate attractive fund performance for our investors. We raised $16.4 billion of new gross commitments, driving our AUM to $334 billion, up 35% year-over-year, and our fee-paying AUM was up 37% year-over-year. Our management fees continued their steady growth, up 41% year-over-year and our fee-related earnings growth was even better increasing almost 50% as we continue to gain operating efficiencies from our strong top line momentum. Our continued growth was driven primarily by our opportunistic and diverse investing activities, often taking advantage of the retrenchment of the banks, and the public markets to provide solutions to high-quality companies and asset owners. Our firm is structured to navigate volatile markets as we build large direct sourcing networks, coupled with flexible strategies that are able to invest across asset classes, geographies and markets. As we mentioned on previous calls, 2022 is the year, where we're investing in our front and back office platforms in advance of our expected growth in the years to come. Yet despite adding 200 professionals in the first half of 2022, and continuing to invest in systems and infrastructure to support future growth, our FRE margins expanded to a record 40.1% in the quarter. We recognize that investors and analysts have been concerned about the impact on alternative managers, from the more challenging market, and economic conditions, marked by high inflation, rising interest rates, and a possible recession. We believe that, our business and portfolios are well positioned to navigate these types of risks. In fact, we have a track record of accelerated growth during past periods of economic recession and market volatility. For example, we increased both our AUM and management fees at a compound annual growth rate of more than 25%, during both the global financial crisis of 2007 to 2009, and the volatility introduced by the COVID pandemic from 2019 to 2021. Our goal at Ares is to perform for our investors throughout market cycles and to be able to invest opportunistically and flexibly when other market participants won't or can't. To accomplish this, we've built our business to withstand market volatility across our AUM, our revenue mix, and the composition of our balance sheet. Approximately 64% of our invested assets are in credit investments, which provide protection from losses or declines in valuation multiples during economic downturns by generally being in the top half of the capital structures of our portfolio investments. While every cycle is different, I would note that the direct lending asset class outperformed other credit investments such as high-yield bonds, syndicated bank loans and investment-grade bonds during the past two full cycles, encompassing the Fed tightening, recession and recovery. Our credit portfolio also provides meaningful benefits to both our fund investors and Ares during rising interest rate environments as roughly 90% of our credit group debt assets are in floating-rate instruments. We would expect this to drive higher ARCC Part one and other credit-based incentive fees in the second half of this year. In fact, ARCC reported on Tuesday that, a full run rate earnings impact from the recent increase in base interest rates through the end of the second quarter, could have increased its second quarter core earnings by about 11%, and add an additional 100 basis point increase in base rates from June 30, could add a 17% increase from second quarter core earnings all else being equal. As you know Ares Management would see a corresponding increase in its ARCC Part I fees. Across the rest of our asset mix, we believe that our growing AUM and real assets, such as real estate and infrastructure will also provide meaningful inflation protection due to the built-in inflation escalators generally incorporated in these assets. Our private equity business is also differentiated with its focus on resilient industries, and flexible capital deployment across debt equity and even distressed assets which may protect our downside through dislocated markets. I would also note that the structure of our AUM and long-dated and perpetual vehicles also provides insulation. About 88% of our AUM and 95% of our management fees are from either long-dated funds or perpetual capital vehicles. Due to the long-term nature of this capital, we have not experienced significant redemption issues during volatile periods. This has enabled us to be patient investors and utilize the capabilities of our experienced teams to support portfolio companies during challenging times. Having significant dry powder and access to capital is also critical to success. At quarter end, we're well-positioned with over $90 billion of available capital of which $52.7 billion is not yet generating management fees, and available to support further FRE growth when deployed. Combining our significant dry powder with the flexible investment mandates of many of our funds, we expect to take further advantage of increasingly attractive opportunities that we believe will arise in the coming quarters as the competitive landscape potentially improves. We believe that our management fee-centric model also provides greater stability to our realized income compared to more performance fee-based and balance sheet-heavy business models. In the first half of 2022, 91% of our RI is derived from our fee-related earnings, and this stability in our earnings has been steadily increasing over the past three years. We have also consistently generated 83% or more of total fee revenues from our management fees. The final component of our model is our asset-light balance sheet where investments represent less than 0.5% of our total AUM. This means that we're less susceptible to changes in market values for risk assets. Putting this all together, we believe that Ares is well-positioned to continue its strong growth with our fee-related earnings and our common stock dividend increasing at least 20% per annum through 2025. From a fundraising perspective there's been a lot of discussion about the more difficult institutional fundraising environment caused by the denominator effect as the value of public equity and fixed income portfolios have traded off substantially. We have not seen this impact in our fundraising to-date and we feel very good about our future fundraising pipeline. During the second quarter, we continued to see strong demand across our investment groups raising $16.4 billion of gross commitments across more than 15 different funds and numerous SMAs, including more than $5 billion of capital raised in our perpetual capital vehicles. As we look forward in addition to our ongoing fundraising activities, we expect to begin another commingled flagship fundraising cycle with four of our largest fund complexes launching successor funds in the second half of this year targeting first closings in 2023. This includes our seventh corporate private equity fund, our sixth European direct lending fund, our second flagship closed-end alternative credit fund and our third U.S. junior capital direct lending fund. We also expect to follow up with our third US senior direct lending fund next year. We continued our momentum with retail investors in the second quarter raising over $1.6 billion in the retail channel. Our retail channel AUM now stands at $57 billion at June 30. With respect to Ares Wealth Management Solutions, we continue to expand in a variety of ways as we see a significant opportunity to gain share in what we believe is a multi-trillion dollar market opportunity just in the next several years. As a global leader in credit and real assets, we believe that we're uniquely positioned to gain share with high net worth investors through our growing suite of income-generating, less volatile non-traded alternative investment products. We've added a senior leader in Asia Pacific and we will be adding a senior leader in Europe shortly both of whom are focused on helping us expand our retail distribution globally. We're also adding additional resources to our 108 professionals globally expanding new products and increasing our distribution channels. We continue to make progress with our distribution here in the US market and we expect to add one or more new wirehouses for our non-traded REIT distribution in the second half of the year. And on the new product front, we launched a new secondary private markets fund with more than $250 million of capital during the second quarter and we remain on file with a new non-traded BDC. Our deployment activity in the second quarter highlights the power of the size, diversity and scale of the platform that we've built over the past several decades. Although private credit and private equity market volumes were generally slower in the second quarter, we had our second largest deployment quarter to-date as we stepped in to gain share in these large addressable markets. We invested $24.1 billion in the quarter, well ahead of the $16.3 billion that we deployed in the first quarter of the year. We saw strong deployment across our US and European direct lending businesses, totaling $7.7 billion and $3.8 billion respectively, as we focus on the expansion needs of our incumbent relationships and larger higher-quality companies, which saw access to private capital while banks retrenched and the capital markets were largely closed. We believe that this compelling environment could continue for some time as many banks and traditional capital providers are generally risk-averse during dislocated markets. In private equity, our special opportunity strategy was very active, deploying $1.7 billion in the quarter as the market environment opened up new opportunities. Of note, our ASOF team has one of the largest investment pipelines that they've seen to date, finding new opportunities in the liquid secondary market as well as a large pipeline of private opportunities in companies seeking creative capital solutions. Our alternative credit business, which also invest opportunistically in diversified portfolios of cash flowing assets also deployed $1.7 billion taking advantage of increased demand for private capital across their target sectors due to a pullback from traditional capital providers. Our real assets group deployed over $5 billion of capital including over $2 billion across our non-traded REITs and $2 billion in our other real estate funds largely maintaining our focus on industrial and multifamily assets. Our newly acquired infrastructure debt business was also active investing nearly $750 million of capital in the quarter. We invested over $800 million through our secondary solution strategy. Interestingly, some of the denominator effect issues I referenced earlier are creating an increased need for portfolio management among private asset owners, which we expect to contribute to an acceleration of secondary transactions. In terms of fund performance, results remained generally strong in the second quarter as cash flow growth trends continued and we didn't see meaningful signs of fundamental weakness in our portfolios. The standout performers for us in the quarter were our US real estate equity strategy, which generated gross returns in the second quarter and last 12 months of 5.1% and 54.9% and our European real estate equity strategy, which generated gross returns in the second quarter and last 12 months of 5.3% and 20.3%. Our non-traded REITs also continued to generate strong income and returns with second quarter net returns for AI-REIT of 6.3% and 3.1% for AREIT. Our US and European real estate portfolios continue to benefit from the overweighting of the best performing industrial and multifamily sectors with significant underweight in office, retail and hospitality. Of note, our $7.6 billion Ares Industrial REIT, which is a good proxy for our US industrial assets saw rent gains on new and renewal leases, up 42% on average in the second quarter and the portfolio was 99.5% leased at quarter end, illustrating the strong demand in the industrial real estate market. In AREIT, our multifamily portfolio generated rent increases on new leases of 21% and on renewing leases 18% during the second quarter. We are seeing cap rates moving higher albeit unevenly across real estate property types but portfolio cash flow growth remains a strong offset in our target markets. Within our significant funds in credit, our direct lending credit strategies continue to outperform liquid market alternatives. Ares Capital Corporation generated a net return of 1.2% in the second quarter and 13.4% for the last 12 months. Similarly, our two largest direct lending strategy composites in the US and Europe also had steady returns. Our US senior direct lending strategy had a gross return of 2.3% for the second quarter and 15.5% for the last 12 months and our European direct lending strategy generated gross returns of 2.6% for the quarter and 11.3% for the last 12 months. Our performance benefited from our floating rate portfolios, strong EBITDA growth and our credit selection in larger companies with a focus on defensive industries. Our private equity returns were also steady, driven by strong EBITDA growth in the second quarter, partially offset by lower equity multiples. Our corporate private equity composite generated gross returns of positive 1.5% in the second quarter and 14% for the last 12 months, while Ares Special Opportunities Fund I generated gross returns of minus 1.5% in the second quarter and 16.8% for the last 12 months. Our ACOF portfolio, particularly benefited from strong growth in healthcare services and our energy investments. Let me now turn the call over to Jarrod to walk through our second quarter financial results in detail and to provide an updated outlook. Jarrod? Thanks Jarrod. I believe our results reinforce the attractiveness of Ares' business model and the important role that private capital plays during times of volatility and uncertainty. As banks retrench and as the capital markets become less reliable, private capital providers like Ares step up, filling the gaps and regain market share. In our view this countercyclicality is an attractive attribute of our business model. So, while there are clearly challenges that lie ahead, we have long tenured teams with a demonstrated track record of growth through volatile markets and while every business cycle is different and this high inflationary environment is certainly new to our economy over the last four decades. Our experience sizable platform, portfolio positioning long-dated capital base and ample dry powder provide us with the tools that we need to generate successful investment outcomes for our clients which in turn we believe will drive impressive results for Ares' shareholders. Through these reasons that we remain confident in our growth trajectory including our longer-term AUM forecast of $500 billion or more by year-end 2025. I want to end by expressing my appreciation for the hard work and the dedication of our employees around the globe. I'm also deeply thankful to our investors for their continued support for our company. Thanks for your time today. And operator could you please open the line for questions. Thank you. Sure. It's hard to say exactly Craig because obviously as we're price discovering and structure discovery in the private markets a lot of it is where we attach and detach and generally where we're comfortable pricing risk. So -- but order of magnitude, if you were to look at the market today factoring in OID and credit spread adjustment and the new SOFR environment, first lien loans in the middle market are probably somewhere in the 500 to 550 range with 90 to 95 OID. So kind of pricing 7% to 875  all-in for first lien piece of paper. That's significantly wider than we saw coming into the beginning of the year. Yes. Kipp's on the line. I'll answer that and Kipp if you have any color chime in because I thought that Kipp did a great job addressing this on the ARCC earnings call earlier in the week. But interestingly a lot of the anxiety that people are feeling right now is forward looking into the back half of the year because if you look at our private credit portfolio the same would be true as we said in our prepared remarks for our real estate and PE portfolios. The reality is, there's still a lot of good fundamental performance and strength. So with regard to private credit and US direct lending in particular, we talked about on the call a 16% year-over-year growth in EBITDA. So still pretty strong. Revenues are up. EBITDAs are up. And if you look at nonaccruals, nonaccruals at cost in the ARCC portfolio at the end of the quarter were 1.6% and significantly lower than that at fair value that's measured against, what would be a 10-year average of 2.5%. Now the same would be true, if you were to look at the liquid markets with the high-yield market at or near historical lows in terms of default rate. So obviously, we have to be measured as we think about credit performance going forward. But at least, as the book sits today still demonstrating a fair amount of credit strike. Yes. Thanks, Alex. That's a good question. So a couple of things. One, and this is true for the credit book. It's also true for PE and for real estate, where we've talked about the fundamental performance outpacing multiple declines or mark-to-market impacts from spread widening and that's an important thing to keep in mind. So again, if you have a book that's growing 16% deleveraging in high-quality companies that are outperforming, even as spreads widen the effect of base rate increases and spreads widening mitigates a little bit. Spreads blew out a little bit more post quarter end. So some of that may be timing. But if you were to look at the middle market index generally, for the quarter, the middle market index broadly was only down about 1%. So, I think it's important to keep in mind, when you see rapid valuation changes happening in the public markets debt or equity, some of that is attributable to a change in the discount rate. A lot of it is attributable to technical funds flow. And the reality is in the private markets. Multiples are holding up much better. And the market is just much more stable in terms of, flows and performance. In terms of credit protection, obviously, we're going from what was a very active deployment environment coming out of the pandemic in 2021 into 2022, moving from an issuer-friendly backdrop to a lender-friendly backdrop. So that shows up in spread and in structure. And so you'll see tightening happening Alex, in every part of the credit dock from number of covenants available nature of those covenants baskets, et cetera. And I would say generally, the more prolonged the potential for stress, the tighter the docs will get. Yes. So, the majority of that was from our two non-traded REITs so about -- of that was from our non-traded REITs. We had close to $100 million through ATM equity issuance at ARCC and then we had about another $400 million, coming in through our diversified credit interval funds and some of the other funds that we're raising through the retail channel on the co-mingled side.  What we're seeing on the ground, it's interesting and it really depends on the product. We're not seeing a meaningful slowdown in growth right now month-over-month, which is we're happy to see that. We're also not seeing significant redemption. So if you look, at that $818 million of inflows an example into our non-traded REITs, I think we had redemptions to match that of about $38 million. I think that's a commentary on the positioning of some of those funds. In terms of the performance, the full cycle investment strategy the lower leverage and the yield. But I think the appetite in that channel continues to be really strong across the board, for some of this alternative product. The other advantage we have, is we continued to invest as frankly despite the growth that we're experiencing we're underpenetrated, with some of these products across the wires. And so as I said in my prepared remarks, we would expect to add one or two new wires in the back half of the year, for the non-traded product, which is generally going to give us a little bit more organic growth opportunity just as we broaden out that distribution. So at least from our perspective what we're seeing on the ground is the demand is there. I think the secular trend is intact. And the redemptions are lower than I think some of our peers have seen. Sure. Sure. Happy to Gerry. Just to clarify when you mean targets, can you just expand on what exactly you'd like me to comment on? I'm happy to.\nGerry O'Hara: Well, if there's any targets that have been put forth either at a company level or within your portfolio of companies that would be helpful. And if they are not specific targets just sort of an overall approach. Anything from a color perspective would be I think helpful? Sure. I'll try to cover a very wide-ranging topic in a fairly concise answer here. We are very committed to best-in-class execution across all of our ESG activities. And the way that we think about positioning of ESG, number one we have an ESG group that reports directly into me. I think it's a demonstration of the strategic importance of that function as we continue to develop it over time. And that team at corporate is supported by, gosh, probably close to 100 what we would call ESG champions in the field that represent each of the investment and non-investment functions as they think about embedding ESG best practices into their business. The way we think about it in a simplistic framework is corporate sustainability is one pillar of our ESG framework and that's where we basically are looking at all things Ares as it relates to ESG. So what's our carbon footprint? What can we do to improve? And so on and so forth. With regard to targets there, we have not made any kind of net-zero commitment. But I think over time we likely will. We just put out our first TCFD report about a month ago in our second corporate sustainability report. So if you want to dig in, you can see some of the goals that we're setting for ourselves there and that will give people a general sense for the road we're on. We marry corporate sustainability initiatives with what we broadly call our responsible investment initiatives and that's where we're embedding ESG practices into our due diligence portfolio management and investing activities that is quite robust and is becoming more developed. Obviously, there's a significant amount of investor demand to see progress along that framework. So I would expect to see a number of our funds in the market and coming to market to designate articulate in Europe and I think you'll begin to see other products coming online in the near future, not the least of which is for example our climate infrastructure fund, which just by its very nature is right in the heart of the energy transition and all things ESG. We have been leading in our private credit business as a very significant provider of sustainability-linked loans into the private market across the franchise. And as a borrower, we've also been a pretty significant user of SLLs in our own borrowing. And so, we're trying to lead by example in the private credit markets as well. So, this is a long multiyear journey, Gerry, but we've got it very well resourced. We've got a significant operating plan in place and I think we're executing well against it.\nGerry O'Hara: Appreciate the color, and apologies for the broad-based question. But, thank you. No, no worries. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad you brought that out. Thank you. Sure. I think we have to differentiate between dialing back when we talk about deployment and dollars invested versus dialing back in terms of credit selectivity, structuring and pricing discipline, et cetera. So, we are absolutely dialing back as well in terms of our expected return for the risk that we're taking and the structure of that risk. It's not showing up in the deployment numbers, because we are the largest player in the market with a broad global footprint and the ability to play up and down the capital structure in different geographies and industries. So, what you don't see in those numbers, is actually more selectivity, more structuring and pricing discipline and more price discovery as we work through the available pipeline. The other thing keep in mind, and I referenced this in the prepared remarks is, the banks are obviously retrenching. They're dealing with a fairly sizable I wouldn't say catastrophic in any way, but fairly sizable inventory of unsyndicated exposure. That's obviously having them reduce risk appetite. The capital markets are challenged right now. So, when we get into that type of environment, we tend to see larger higher quality borrowers that otherwise would have gone into those markets come direct to the private credit market and effectively expand the addressable market opportunity. So, that's part of, I think, what is driving the numbers in the quarter and should into the back of the year. One thing I would highlight, when you look at our deployment numbers, we did make a meaningful acquisition of a middle market portfolio from annually in the quarter about $2.4 billion. So that skews the numbers slightly in terms of the deployment when you're just thinking about new issue volumes versus secondary. So, I would say we are being more selective. We're being more demanding. Dialing back, I'll leave it to you as to kind of how you want to define that. But I absolutely think you're supposed to be more measured in the market that's transitioning the way that this one is. Thank you. Yeah, Hi, Fin. It's a good question. I think the simple answer is yes. And we talked about it in the prepared remarks, which is everyone refers to denominator effect. But it's really a combination of numerator effect in 2021 and denominator effect in 2022. So, if you just look at it, generally speaking, over the last three years, we had very significant deployment -- probably accelerated deployment coming out of the heart of COVID, which had a lot of private equity GPs coming back to market earlier than they otherwise expected on the heels of significant performance, 40% 50% 60% type rates of returns last year. So, going into 2022, I think a lot of institutional investors were at or near their full allocation for regular way private equity. And then, the denominator effect kicks in, which makes that full allocation start to feel like an over-allocation. Again, as I said in the script, I think it's largely for the time being a private equity phenomenon and what winds up happening in markets like that is fundraisings get drawn out, as people resolve their allocations and available capital. And then, I think other solutions for liquidity kick-in. So secondary, as an example should actually see an acceleration in demand both from LPs and GPs as people are trying to manage through the current liquidity environment. And I think creative private credit solutions the likes of which we provide through our special ops teams, our alternative credit teams, and our direct lending teams will also become a bigger factor as people are owning companies longer. So, you referenced the larger platforms. We've been talking about this for years. If you think about the secular growth trends and also growing across the broad spectrum but the larger platforms are growing at a minimum 2x the market growth and just capturing more share of wallet and I think that will continue to accelerate, particularly in a market like this where I think LPs that are potentially over-allocated or at allocation will likely lean in on some of the more strategic GP relationships. So, the interesting thing about our business is positioned on either side of that, right? So, if you see a modest slowdown in primary LBO activity in the middle market, you're going to see a pickup in structured debt and equity investing to resolve the in-place book of business as well as likely a ramp in secondaries. But again, I don't think that there's anything problematic about it. We've seen it before and I think it will resolve itself. But it's definitely leading to slower fundraising for regular way PE at least in the early part of this year. \nFinian O'Shea: Thanks. That's helpful. And just a follow-up on real estate continuing to do very well there's very strong pricing as you outlined. Can you talk about how much as you see it how much this phenomenon has played out in terms of pricing gains as leases roll over? How will it go for the rest of the portfolio and perhaps in the future? I think Bill Benjamin; our Global Head of Real Estate is on. I'll let him if he is -- give you his views and I can chime in with some color to the extent I have anything to add. Bill are you on? And one thing I would also maybe just to add -- one quick addition which I think is just important for people to keep in mind. If you think about past real estate cycles and where we've seen distress, they've largely occurred in markets and situations where the market was oversupplied. We are in exactly the opposite situation. So, even before we got into supply chain constraint we were in an appropriately if not undersupplied market. When you factor in supply chain constraints and inflation on raw material inputs the time to deliver new product into some of these undersupplied markets and the cost to deliver product into these undersupplied markets obviously makes the value of the in-force real estate just that much more attractive. So, it is a slightly different dynamic that exists today in most of the markets that we play in that I think people are used to seeing through the lens of historical cycle. So it's also less leverage. We're seeing less for selling. So there's just a lot more stability in the market than we would have seen in prior cycles. Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Rob. So we obviously showed folks a high-level view of growth expectations at our Investor Day. And I would say we are still on that trajectory. You do have a good memory, we said that we would expect that we would begin the organic distribution of our annuity product this quarter and we did in fact doing that. So that machine turned on about a month ago and now we're starting to ramp that.. Importantly too, our reinsurance business is growing. I think at our Investor Day we talked about roughly $1 billion of reinsurance flows. That number is now $2 billion. So we're seeing good growth with the existing scenic relationships as well as the addition of new relationships, and we continue to have success on raising behind that growth largely with third-party capital. So we have hit a couple of those important milestones that you referenced in terms of turning on the organic growth engine and the capital raising and are absolutely on plan with the path that we laid out at the Investor Day. Yes, it's a good point to make, because when we were talking about acquisitions prior to this bad market volatility, it was obviously largely about identifying large addressable markets, where we felt like we could bring some kind of strategic advantage to. And just as a quick aside, the acquisition integration and growth strategy, it's been going exactly as we hoped it would. And so the combination of the Black Creek acquisition Landmark and the AMP debt are all, I think, we're pleased to have them on the platform going into this environment. We have seen in the past just, as a reminder, if you look at the GFC we acquired Allied Capital in 2010 and the reverberations of the GFC, we acquired ACAS, we had a number of tuck-in CLO manager acquisition. So our historical experience would tell us that when you see distress in the market in smaller less well-capitalized managers that are either having balance sheet issues or personnel issues, we'll look to transact. And so I would expect that that would happen again if this market persisted. It's still too early Rob to see that flow. It usually first shows up frankly as portfolio acquisition opportunities or portfolio acquisitions with small team lift outs as opposed to platform trades. But if it persists and is prolonged I would expect to see some things get catalyzed and I would expect that we would get calls on those, but I think that's still a ways away. Thanks, Rob. Sure. I'll give a general overview for both, because I think the answer is the same. And I apologize for kind of grossly oversimplifying. But we just finished talking about the consolidation of dollars with fewer managers. The reality is as that continues to play out large players like us have come to realize that scale is a huge benefit and driver of positive investment outcomes and growth. And the reason is, we just frankly have more people against more markets with a better toolkit that's more relevant to more people in the market. And so we're capturing disproportionate share. And so the origination engine is a huge advantage. The capital scale and flexibility is a huge advantage. The portfolio management investment is a huge advantage. The information that we're able to pull across all these different markets. So the simple answer is, while there's always competition, the larger we get, the more entrenched our relationships become, the more we're able to outcompete people for higher-quality assets. And that's true in direct lending and it's true in real estate, in a market that is consolidating, whether you're talking about brokers, banks, sell-side advisers, they're consolidating as well. And I think that means that, while there is continued flows into the market, I would expect we'll see just a disproportionate share of that flow and disproportionate share of the investment opportunity. Direct lending is a little bit unique relative to real estate in the sense that, as a lender, versus an equity investor, we're able to monetize incumbent relationships within the portfolio much more actively. So if you look at our private credit books, 50% to 60% of our deal flow is typically coming from incumbent borrowers. As we continue to build specialty lending verticals like technology, software, sports media and entertainment, life sciences, they start to grow the non-sponsored side of the business, which is also a way to mitigate any marginal competition that we feel. So we're seeing over half of our flow in largely noncompeting situations just monetizing the existing relationships we have. On the equity side, when we talk about real estate, we don't have those incumbent lender relationships. We have those incumbent broker, operating partner, bank relationships that also drive disproportionate flow. And I think we're not alone in that. I think the other large-scaled alt managers would tell you that they're having a similar experience. Yes. No, I appreciate it. I don't think you're picking on my words. It's actually, it's both, right? So when we talked about the opportunity in secondaries leading up to this year, we were talking about a broad secular growth theme, which was being driven by a move from LP-led deals to GP-led deals, globalization of the business and move away from private equity transactions into real assets and credit. So there's this broad overarching secular growth trend which is still intact. What I was really referring to now is, there should be an accelerated cyclical growth opportunity because of this issue of overallocation in certain pockets of the market. And so, both for LPs looking to free up liquidity to invest into this vintage, or GPs who need to extend the life of their existing portfolios, I think, you'll see secondaries both on the LP side and the GP side benefit. So I think, for me, it's not picking the words. It's really secular versus cyclical. I think, now we have a cyclical opportunity that we'll just amplify the secular trend that we've been talking about for the last couple of years. Sure. We can't comment on any specific fund raise, but what I will say qualitatively is, the integration could not be going any better. As we talked about when that acquisition was made, what we loved about it was, we had a market-leading team that was already scaled with an institutional quality track record and investor base. And the opportunity to come here was to accelerate fundraising, continue to invest in growth of the platform in new parts of the capital structure and new geographies and then, to begin to leverage some of the synergies that exist with other parts of the Ares Infrastructure business. And all of that is happening and the integration collaboration has been fantastic. So we've got really good fundraising momentum. We are adding people in new geographies, making increased investments in the European market, continuing to scale our presence in APAC and just going to be happier with the way that's going. And we'll be in a position I think to update people on the fundraising progress that we're making there next quarter. Yes, Ken. I mean, that would be our hope. But I just want to highlight, these four funds, obviously, they're very meaningful flagship credit funds. And if you look at the sequential growth of the prior vintages, it's been within that range, if not better. I'm less focused on fund size and fund growth here because all of those fund products actually pay on deployment. So I think the reality is whether we grow 20%, 40% or 50%, the value contribution is going to come from bringing that liquidity on and deploying it. So yeah, we hope to see them grow consistent with our past experience, but we don't need them to grow in order to continue to deliver the types of growth rates that we've articulated to all of you. Yeah. I mean, Europe I would say we're seeing similar trends to what we're seeing here in terms of bank retrenchment and challenges in the capital markets. Our competitive position in Europe, frankly is probably stronger, not to say that we don't have a leading US franchise as well, but we just have much less consistent scaled competition in that market. So I would say while the trends in terms of the ecosystem around us and the investment opportunity I would say that from a competitive dynamic standpoint, there's just less competition there and I think we've been demonstrating that market leadership is pretty valuable. On the Asia side, I think you have to think about it by region in our what I would call more regular way acquisition finance business in developed Asia, largely focused on Australia and New Zealand. That continues on a good growth trajectory and is seeing similar trends to what we're seeing in other parts of the developed world. When you start to talk about what we're seeing coming out of developing Asia slightly different. Those capital markets are pretty volatile right now, you're dealing with challenges in the China bank and bond market. You've got some regional economic issues with a slow recovery from COVID. And so that set up is different here. And obviously the direct lending market in Asia Pacific generally is just much less developed much less evolved and much less scale than this year. That's what we're excited about. But at the same time, the way that the market is developing there, it's probably a little bit more challenging from a pure direct lending standpoint than the US and Europe is. Thank you. Yeah. So that is a -- we referenced it in the prepared remarks. That's actually a retail-oriented fund that we launched this quarter with $250 million of seed capital from Ares and two of our strategic investors. Similar to our other retail-oriented product, we would expect that it will get raised through a combination of distribution through the RIA and wirehouse channel. It is focused on the private equity side of the market. So if you think about our broad product offering on the retail side, we have our non-traded REIT product to deliver a broad exposure to our real estate capabilities. We have our diversified credit tangible fund to give people access to our broad-based credit expertise and this is really an opportunity for people to get access to the private equity capabilities that exist here. The fund as it ramps will largely be focused on leveraging our secondary solutions business. But as it scales, the fund also has the ability to do direct private equity investing. And as the fund diversifies that's exactly what we would plan to do. So there's no real target per se seeing as it's a perpetual open-ended vehicle and we'll continue to ramp it the way that we've ramped our other non-traded product. Yeah, it has both management fee and incentives. I don't have the terms of that fund in front of me. I don't know if Jarrod or anybody else does that they want to chime in if not we can get you that information off-line. Great. Thank you. Thanks for all the time today. Sorry, if we ran a little long, but we appreciate everybody's support and attention and hope that everybody gets a little bit of downtime this summer and look forward to talking to everybody next quarter."

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, April 28, 2022. I will now turn the call over to Carl Drake, Head of Public Markets Investor Relations for Ares Management.\nCarl Drake: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for our first quarter conference call. I'm joined today by Michael Arougheti, our Chief Executive Officer; and Jarrod Phillips, our Chief Financial Officer. We also have a number of executives with us today who will be available during Q&A. Before we begin, I want to remind you that comments made during this call contain forward-looking statements and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those identified in our risk factors in our SEC filings. Our actual results could differ materially, and we undertake no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Please also note that past performance is not a guarantee of future results. During this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Please refer to our first quarter earnings presentation available on the Investor Resources section of our website for reconciliations of the measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Please note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Ares fund. This morning, we announced that we declared our second quarter common dividend of $0.61 per share of its Class A and nonvoting common stock. This represents an increase of 30% over a dividend for the same quarter a year ago. The dividend will be paid on June 30, 2022, to holders of record on June 16. Now, I will turn the call over to Michael Arougheti, who will start with some quarterly financial and business highlights.\nMichael Arougheti: Thank you, Carl and good morning. I hope everyone is doing well. During 2021 and especially the fourth quarter, the financing markets were incredibly active which led to record investment activity for us across most of our strategies. During the first quarter of '22, the Fed stepped up its fight against inflation and we saw a sharp rise in interest rates. The beginning of a protracted war in Ukraine and prolonged lockdowns in China, added further uncertainty and volatility to the typically seasonally slow first quarter. As a result, across many markets, general transaction activity slowed, yet some financing activity that would typically have tapped the traded markets, shifted to the private markets, where there is more certainty of execution and increasing scale to manage larger transactions. At Ares, it is part of our DNA to navigate volatility and to find opportunities in transitioning markets. To that point, despite the challenging backdrop, we continued our strong growth in the first quarter across all of our key financial metrics. On a year-over-year basis, our management fees and fee-related earnings increased 47% and 59% respectively and our realized income increased 62%. Importantly, our fee-related earnings accounted for 93% of our realized income for the first quarter and over 81% for the last 12 months. Our core FRE growth of 59% is especially gratifying in the face of this volatility and we believe that our prospects remain bright for continued strong growth across all five of our business groups. With a record $92 billion of available capital to invest, a robust fundraising pipeline over the next 18 months and compelling fund performance, we believe that we have strong visibility for continued growth in earnings over the coming quarters and years. Despite increasing interest rates, the global search for reliable income continues unabated as investors are continuing to see premium returns over the liquid market equivalent with less volatility. During the first quarter, we raised $13.7 billion of gross capital as new and existing investors allocated funds across our broadening platform. Existing investors accounted for more than 90% of our direct capital raise during the first quarter and we expect this general trend to continue, as we remain largely underpenetrated with our existing investor base. We believe our continued strong growth, reflects our investment performance, the continued scaling of our existing strategies and our expanding offering of new investment strategies and solutions, designed to serve our clients. We continue to aggressively expand in all three of our distribution channels, institutional, retail and insurance to add investors and to capitalize on the long-running growth trends in these markets. Notable highlights for the first quarter, included additional closings for several commingled funds in the market, a $1.1 billion first close on our sixth European real estate opportunistic fund, $900 million for our sixth Asian special situations Fund, $1.1 billion across our two Landmark secondaries funds, $600 million for our special opportunities fund and $400 million for our new APAC direct lending fund. Our perpetual capital funds also continue to scale. And in the aggregate, we're 63% higher year-over-year, reaching $83 billion or more than 25% of our AUM. One notable first quarter highlight was the reopening of our core alternative credit open-ended fund, where we raised an additional $1.1 billion. Our forward Black Creek nontraded REITs, now branded as Ares REITs, also continue to scale and benefit from being part of the Ares platform. For the first quarter, our two nontraded REITs, saw inflows totaling $900 million and performance continues to be strong. Our credit interval fund also continues to scale with more than $0.5 billion of new commitments and collectively our perpetual capital flows totaled $5.8 billion in the first quarter.  So, looking out over the next 12 months, we expect to have more than 25 different commingled funds in the market including several of our largest flagship funds expected to launch toward year-end. We expect 2022 will be a solid year of fundraising but the timing of these large flagship fundraises will ultimately dictate the final tally for this year, versus next year and in relation to last year's record fundraising levels.  We ended the first quarter with $325 billion in AUM up 57% versus the same period a year ago. The vast majority of our AUM growth continues to be organic, but we have made strategic acquisitions in segments that we believe are experiencing significant investor demand and that present attractive growth opportunities. A great example of this is the acquisition of our new infrastructure debt platform which closed during the first quarter.  We believe that infrastructure needs globally will be significant in the coming decade driven by population and economic growth, increasing privatization of infrastructure assets the global energy transition and the shift to sustainable and digital infrastructure. The team is integrating well, we're having positive fundraising discussions and we expect to have more to report on this next quarter. We believe that our infrastructure debt business is uniquely positioned to meet the need for capital in this space by offering a variety of credit solutions across industries and geographies. We continue to expand our Ares Wealth Management Solutions business which we believe is the second largest wealth distribution platform owned by any alternative manager. The group now has over 105 professionals and we are seeking to expand our geographic reach into new overseas markets and to enhance our capabilities.  We continue to make progress increasing our distribution with wirehouses and large private banks and we expect to see this begin to reflect in fundraising later this year. On the new product front, we leveraged our secondary solutions experience to launch a new secondary private markets fund with more than $250 million including the seed backing of several institutional investors. In addition, we filed for a new nontraded BDC which is an area where we have significant experience as one of the largest BDC managers in the country. We continued our momentum in the first quarter raising over $2 billion in the retail channel and our retail AUM now stands at $56 billion at March 31. We expect retail fundraising will continue gaining momentum in the coming quarters and years.  Despite the seasonality and volatility that I discussed earlier, we were still active making investments across our strategies during the first quarter. Certain markets were more impacted temporarily by volatility and this created trading and special situations opportunities for us whereas other markets remained active which is driven by strong secular trends.  We demonstrated the flexibility, scale and breadth of our investment capabilities as we invested more than $16 billion for the first quarter which compares to just under $13 billion a year ago. In credit, we experienced a 30% year-over-year increase in deployment activity. We continue to focus on high-quality franchise assets that we expect will continue to grow and perform well throughout market cycles. To that point earlier this week, we entered into an agreement where our credit funds will purchase a $2.4 billion middle market direct lending portfolio from Annaly Capital Management. As a major player in the direct lending sector, we knew this portfolio quite well and this portfolio acquisition will serve to accelerate our deployment, provide incumbency benefits on new portfolio names and further solidify our relationships with existing and new sponsors. Deployment across real estate was also strong in the first quarter, up 90% year-over-year including the additional deployment we're seeing in our recently acquired industrial funds. In terms of fund performance rising inflation and interest rates had only a modest impact on certain segments of our portfolio for the first quarter. Real estate continued its strong performance as the US real estate equity composite generated gross returns in the first quarter of 10.4% and 68.1% for the last 12-month period and our European real estate equity composite had gross returns of 5% in the quarter and 32% for the last 12 months. Our US and European real estate portfolios continue to benefit from an overweighting to industrial and multifamily properties with significant underweights in office retail and hospitality. In our nontraded REITs, the performance remains excellent with AI-REIT generating a first quarter net return of 17.2% and A-REIT generating a first quarter net return of 7.5%. The performance in our nontraded REITs was driven by the strong trends in industrial and multifamily property types submarket selection across our portfolios, high rent growth and utilization rates and higher new rental rates on completion builds above our underwriting base cases.  All of these factors led to strong growth in net operating income across our assets. Within credit, our private credit strategy has generated strong returns in the quarter. Our flagship US direct lending fund, Ares Capital Corporation generated a net return of 2.7% in the first quarter and 19.1% for the last 12 months. Our European direct lending strategy generated steady gross returns of 2.3% for the quarter and 12.7% for the last 12 months. Our performance benefited from our asset selection with a focus on defensive industries, along with a predominantly senior secured floating rate portfolio. In liquid credit, we outperformed our benchmarks in our high-yield and global multi-asset strategies for the first quarter and 12-month periods with slight underperformance in syndicated loans in the first quarter driven by the inclusion of high-yield baskets in some of these portfolios. And in Asia, our special situations fund composite, generated a gross return of 0.6% in the quarter and 18.1% for the last 12 months. Our private equity returns continue to outperform the volatile public equity markets. Our ACOF composite, generated gross returns of negative 1% in the first quarter and positive 30% for the 12-month period, while Ares special opportunities generated gross returns of 2.4% in the first quarter and 36% for the last 12 months. Our secondary strategies also continued their strong performance, with private equity generating gross returns of 4.6% for the quarter and 43.5% for the trailing 12-month period, while real estate generated gross returns of 12.2% for the quarter and 54.5% over the trailing 12 months. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Jarrod to walk through the first quarter financial results, Jarrod?\nJarrod Phillips: Thank you, Mike. Hello everyone, and thank you for joining us. As Mike stated, despite the typical seasonal slowdown which was compounded by increased market volatility, we achieved strong year-over-year growth in management fees, fee-related earnings, realized income and RI per share of Class A stock. Our fundraising platform, continued to drive strong organic growth of $13.7 billion. When combined with the AMP acquisition, our AUM totaled $325 billion at quarter end, up over 6% in the quarter. Starting with our revenues, our quarterly management fees increased 47% year-over-year, due to strong growth in fee paying AUM. The stability of our management fees was evident, as 94% of our management fees came from either perpetual capital for long-dated funds which allows us to manage our assets with a long-term perspective. We had a small amount of fee-related performance revenues in the first quarter from our managed accounts and credit, but as we've stated previously we expect 90% plus of FRPR will come in the fourth quarter, as our retail funds and perpetual managed accounts typically crystallize their fees at year-end. Other fee income increased to approximately $20 million in the quarter, more than triple from the previous year with the increase driven predominantly by property development-related fees from our non-traded REITs in addition to our typical capital structuring and origination fees in certain of our direct lending perpetual funds. For the first quarter, we generated $205.7 million of FRE, an increase of 59% over the first quarter of 2021. And it accounted for over 90% of our realized income in the quarter. Our FRE margin for the first quarter totaled about 40% which was up slightly over the fourth quarter and up 150 basis points versus the first quarter of 2021. We believe we continue to be on track for our 20% compound annual growth in FRE and dividends per Class A common stock, through 2025 and our 45% plus target run rate FRE margin by the end of 2025. Due to the market volatility in the first quarter, realization activity was more modest with $15.3 million of realized performance income. However, our accrued net performance income increased 5.3% in the quarter and is up 100% year-over-year to $850.8 million, reflecting the strong performance of the portfolio and the growth in future realization potential. The increase was led by returns on our credit group which is largely based on cash yields from the portfolio. We expect a limited impact to asset prices from rising rates as 90% of our debt assets in our credit group are in floating rate instruments. We expect to benefit from the floating rate nature of these assets as interest rates increase further. Going forward, we believe the companies in our credit portfolio have built significant cushions to absorb the impact of rising inflation and interest rates. For example, our largest credit fund Ares Capital, which we believe is generally representative of much of our senior direct lending portfolio reported that its average loan to value in its portfolio was historically low at 44%, net interest coverage stood at 2.9 times which is above the 10-year average of 2.6 times. In addition the strong performance in our non-traded REITs in the first quarter drove an accrual on the REIT's balance sheet of $95.5 million of gross performance participation for Ares. While this value is not included in our accrued net performance income or our fee-related performance revenues since it remains subject to the fund's future returns it is a strong start to the year for these two funds. At our Investor Day, last year in August, we outlined the potential for $1.5 billion of net realized performance income, from European waterfall style funds based on the AUM we had in such vehicles at that time. Since our Investor Day, we've raised an additional $24.5 billion of AUM in European style waterfall funds that were not included in that forecast. Looking at our current accrued net performance income of $850.8 million, $531 million or just over 60% is in European-style waterfall funds. We believe a portion of this amount will be recognizable over the next few years and our second quarter's realizations in this area are already pacing ahead of our first quarter's levels. Realized income for the first quarter totaled $222 million up 62% from the first quarter of 2021. After-tax RI per share of Class A common stock was $0.65 for the first quarter, up from $0.46 in the first quarter of 2021. Turning to AUM and related metrics. Our assets under management totaled $325 billion, an increase of more than 6% from the fourth quarter and up 57% from $207 billion in the first quarter of 2021. Our AUM growth in the first quarter included $8.2 billion from the acquisition of AMP's infrastructure debt business. Our fee-paying AUM, totaled $199 billion at quarter end, an increase of approximately 6% from the fourth quarter and up over 55% from the first quarter of 2021. Our growth in fee-paying AUM was primarily driven by a meaningful deployment in our direct lending alternative credit, real estate debt and special opportunity strategies, which are paid on invested capital along with $5 billion in fee-paying AUM from the infrastructure debt acquisition. With market volatility likely to be a constant theme through 2022, we're well-prepared to take advantage of opportunities. Our available capital grew to a record $92.4 billion, an increase of over 62% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with $58.2 billion of AUM not yet paying fees that's available for future deployment and if deployed corresponds to potential annual management fees, totaling $557 million, which represents over 30% of our last 12 months total management fees. Our incentive-eligible AUM increased by 5% quarter-over-quarter and 54% year-over-year to $191.8 billion. Of this amount, $71.4 billion was uninvested at quarter end, which represents a meaningful amount of potential future value creation opportunities for us. Earlier in the first quarter, we opportunistically accessed the debt markets before the spike in interest rates and successfully issued $500 million of 30-year fixed rate senior notes with a coupon of 3.65%. Following this issuance our rating agencies have affirmed our company's investment-grade rating and we're well-positioned with ample liquidity and balance sheet light business model. We believe this business is well-prepared for any market uncertainty ahead of us. The combination of our management fee-centric business model, the perpetual and long-duration nature of our assets and a substantial portion of our AUM and credit-related or inflation-protected assets, we believe will serve to reduce the volatility in our core financial metrics. When coupling, our ample liquidity with our substantial amount of available capital of $92 billion, we believe we're well-positioned to be opportunistic in a potentially more attractive investing environment. I'll now turn the call back over to Mike for his thoughts and concluding remarks.\nMichael Arougheti: Thanks Jarrod. Over the past few months, we've received many questions from investors about how the business may be impacted by the uncertainties ahead of us. Ares is purpose built to not just withstand, but to excel during turbulent markets. We employ a management fee-centric model and an asset-light balance sheet, which helps drive stability. We invest primarily in floating rate credit assets in real assets that have some degree of inflation protection and we take a growth mindset in our private equity strategies, while using structural protections to protect downside risk. We also have extensive restructuring and distressed investing capabilities embedded in a variety of our strategies. We have a demonstrated track record during volatile markets and we've generated some of our fastest AUM and management fee growth through periods like the Great Financial Crisis and the recent COVID pandemic. For these reasons that we remain confident in our growth trajectory including our long-term AUM forecast of $500 billion or more by year-end 2025. I want to end by expressing my appreciation for all of the hard work and dedication of our employees around the globe. I'm also deeply thankful to all of our investors for their continued support of our company. Thanks for your time today. And operator with that we can open the line for questions.\nOperator: We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session.  And our first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Good morning, Michael. Hope you and the team are doing well.\nMichael Arougheti: Hi, Craig.\nCraig Siegenthaler: So we heard Kipp's commentary on the ARCC call about being more selective and building liquidity, but I wanted to get a sense on the overall credit quality migration of the portfolio. So I was wondering if you could comment on high-level trends like restructuring activity, early-stage delinquencies, non-accrual inflows and not just at ARCC but across the global direct lending business?\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. Thanks Craig. I'm glad you opened with that, because I think there's maybe a little bit of a misunderstanding about the durability of the private credit asset class in this type of environment. And what makes this so unique is we're going into this rate hike cycle with positioning at/or near all-time highs in terms of the credit quality of the book any way you look at it. So as Kipp talked about if you look at the year-over-year EBITDA growth within the ARCC portfolio, which is indicative of what we're seeing across the board we saw 20% year-over-year cash flow growth. I don't think that we've seen that before. That book is positioned with three times interest coverage against prior cyclical averages in the low 2s. We had almost record low nonaccruals at 1.2% at cost. We are entering at very low loans to value. And in that portfolio we were attaching at about 45% loan to value. So a significant amount of credit support below. And so while I understand that there are folks who are used to expecting credit deterioration in rising rate environments the reality is there's a long way to go before we would see a rise in rates materialize as increased defaults and even loss given default in the book. I think more importantly given the floating rate positioning of all of these private credit assets we would expect the next 100 or 200 basis points of rate increases to be significantly accretive not just to those portfolios but to the P&L of Ares Management. I think Kipp articulated on the ARCC call, that if you were to look at the existing positioning of that book the first 100 basis points we absorbed just based on the in-place LIBOR floors. But if you were to expect a 200 basis point increase in short-term rates that would increase their earnings in excess of 25% from where they are today. And I think that's a pretty consistent positioning across the board. I would drill down a little bit too whether we're talking about mortgage loans, infrastructure loans, corporate loans, we are the top of the capital structure in most if not all of these situations with control. And so I would not underestimate the value of that equity subordination that's reflecting those loans to value as we work through the market transition. So while there's a lot to be mindful of given everything that's happening in the economy, as well as the rate backdrop these tend to be pretty attractive markets for us. And one last thing, if folks want to look at public information if you go back and look at the last two periods of rate hikes, what you'll see both across the syndicated loan and high-yield market but also within the BDC space is that default performance through those periods of rate escalation were below historical averages and that's a combination of cash flow growth outpacing the rise in rates and the benefit of some of this equity subordination that I talked about. So I think we're in a pretty good spot. \nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Michael. Very helpful. And just had a follow-up on inorganic opportunities just seeing what you guys did with the Annaly exit earlier this week, which provided you an FRE accretive opportunity and just thinking back to the last big bad bear market when you guys acquired the Allied business, but are you seeing other properties like that especially in the BDC space which could be accretive for Ares? \nMichael Arougheti: Yes. I would say it's an interesting distinction Craig because you look at an Annaly or an Allied and those are obviously inorganic but those project much more like portfolio purchases than some of the platform acquisitions that we've made, both are accretive both add value in different ways. We are seeing even in the early days of the market transition more opportunities and productive dialogue around asset portfolios today. And I think Annaly is a great example of that. Some of that is the liquidity position of other players in the market and some of it is in the case of our friends at Annaly kind of a repositioning and refocus on core strategies and I would expect we'll see more of them. \nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Michael.\nMichael Arougheti: Thanks, Craig. Do well.\nOperator: The next question comes from Robert Lee with KBW. Please go ahead. Robert, if you\u2019re speaking your line might be muted. \nRobert Lee: Sorry about that. Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate it. Mike and everyone\u2019s doing well. I wanted to talk a little bit about fundraising. Obviously, you talked about your outlook. But can you maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing from the LP side? I mean obviously there's been a lot of discussion about PE cycles maybe getting drawn out but maybe other share -- other asset classes having more continued demand. Could you maybe speak a little bit to what you're seeing? And then also remind us as you get to the end of this year into next year which flagship funds you may be coming back to market with? \nMichael Arougheti: Sure. There's probably two or three things to unpack Rob, so I'll try to hit them in order. But maybe just as a quick reminder because we talk about an overarching secular trend in our market which is just the consolidation of share in the hands of the larger platforms across the alt landscape and that is continuing. So I think that folks like Ares are having a slightly different experience than maybe smaller or single asset managers. And I think that's being reflected in the fundraising. I think what you're referring to, which is something that we are seeing, but I would say it's largely as we're experiencing it in the private equity side of the house which is because of the active level of deployment that has occurred over the last couple of years a number of private equity managers are coming back to the market sooner than expected. And the entrenched GP base is spending more time, what I would say, re-underwriting re-ups and incumbent relationships versus new. And so, within the private equity part of the market, there are probably a number of managers who are not getting shelf space, because people are focused on re-ups, I think that will benefit, again, the larger more entrenched managers who have multiple products in the space. We are not experiencing that in other parts of the business. In our private equity business, the good news is, if that trend were to affect us, we just brought our second special ops fund out of the market at the hard cap and the ACOF fund family is not in the market today. That is a fund, to your latter question, Rob, that we would expect will be coming sometime towards the end of the year or early next year depending on deployment, that's about 50% deployed today. But we are not seeing any slowdown in the demand for the real asset side of the business or the credit side of the business. Uniquely, and we talked a lot about just the fundraising backdrop coming into this year, 2021 was a record year. We went in with similar commentary to what we told all of you at the beginning of this year, which is, we've got great momentum and great diversity of strategies and some of this will be timing. I think we had a really solid first quarter at $14 billion. But what's unique about the first quarter, for the first time in a long time, there's no flagship fund in there of scale. So what you'll see when you go through the earnings presentation, is just a broad distribution of capital gathering across a host of strategies, as well as that higher floor that we're now getting from our perpetual capital vehicles, retail vehicles and CLO franchise. And so, you're beginning to see the benefit of that diversification and retail positioning. The delta, as we get into the back half of this year, is to kind of how big of a year will it be relative to last year. And what we'll see next year is, really, a couple of big funds. One will be our European direct lending fund. Obviously, one of the larger fund families on the platform, significant market leadership position. Deployment has been ahead of pace and that is one that I could see coming back to market a little bit earlier. Similar with some of our flagship US private credit funds, our climate infrastructure fund, I mentioned, ACOF. So there's like a not insignificant number of the larger funds that we're probably looking at 2023 that may get pulled forward, based on deployment at that time. We'll see as we get through the year, it's really going to be a function of what the investment environment looks like and how the deployment pace picks up.\nRobert Lee: Great. That was helpful. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: The next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlex Blostein: Hi. Good morning. And, Mike, just building on the last point you made around capital deployment, I was hoping you could expand a little bit, how you're seeing the deployment strategy within credit, especially in light of the fact that sponsor activity has been a little slower, albeit maybe sort of temporarily. So maybe kind of help us balance the dependency on the sponsor community for Ares to deploy capital within credit, versus the ability to perhaps write larger checks. We've seen a lot -- a number of quite sizable unit tranche deals that you and some of the others have participated in, versus maybe some of the opportunistic deployment that could come in the form of, again, more and more sort of distressed type of opportunities, but helping to kind of frame that a little bit more. Thanks.\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. I'm just going to -- I'm going to start with where you ended, because we hinted at this in the prepared remarks, because of the diversity of our strategies, we're deploying pretty consistently quarter-to-quarter. Where that deployment comes from is a function of what the market environment is. So if we're in an environment where new M&A transaction volume is lower, particularly within the private equity space that probably means that we're more actively deploying in our special sits opportunistic credit and alternative credit portfolios. And so, what's happening is, we're broadening out the scale and flexibility of the strategies. You're seeing more consistent deployment quarter-over-quarter. And you look at what we did in Q1 across the entire platform, both drawdown and non-drawdown funds, we put about $16.2 billion to work, which is 25% plus higher than the first quarter of 2021. So we'll only know out as we get into the year, because Q1 is seasonally slow. If you look at the ramp in transaction volume last year, a lot of that volume showed up in Q3 and particularly in Q4. So we're actually quite optimistic, given the year-over-year trend that the deployment pace will continue. We're not quite sure exactly where it's going to show up. Kipp, I think did a good job articulating some of the benefits of our market position in terms of deployment. We've articulated every quarter, the value of these incumbent relationships we have both within the existing portfolio and within the existing equity community. But Q1 is a good example two-third of the deployment of the BDC came from within the portfolio and that opportunity to continue to deliver capital into the names that we know as they either delever or scale, reduces reliance on the new issue and M&A market for deployment and that's a pretty meaningful differentiator for us given the way that our business is positioned versus someone who's more focused on new volumes. In other parts of our business we're just actually seeing share gains and share growth. So Europe, obviously, we have a different market share position there. The Asian markets are showing us slightly different opportunities. But everyone is deploying pretty well right now. And I want to just deemphasize a \"reliance on sponsor activity\" because I think the business has outgrown that. That said and Kipp could chime in here for things if he disagrees, the pipeline is actually starting to build on the PE side. We talked about this on the Q4 earnings call. I think Kipp appropriately articulated caution in terms of Q1 deployment relative to Q4, but we did say the mitigant to that is once you get through a repricing or rerating of the market given the amount of dry powder on the sidelines we would expect transaction activity to pick up. And at least as I'm sitting here today and looking at the shadow pipeline of deals building the private equity community is actually starting to pick up activity now that we're getting a better look at what the new valuation environment is. \nAlex Blostein: Great. Super helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kenneth Lee with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. \nKenneth Lee: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Wondering if you could just share with us some thoughts around implications of higher interest rates across the rest of your businesses? You talked about credit, but wondering if you could talk about private equity real estate and some of the other businesses? \nMichael Arougheti: Yes. We cover direct lending so I won't beat that dead horse, but I do think it's an important takeaway for folks when you look at the amount of our exposures across the private credit landscape, they are all for the most part short duration floating rate assets that are through their floors. And that is going to be a pretty meaningful tailwind for us. If you look then at the real assets book there are inherent inflation hedges in that portfolio. On the credit side, they are similarly positioned on short duration floating rate assets. And on the equity side, I think, there's always a debate about the relationship between cap rates and interest rates. But I will tell you based on everything that we're seeing in the portfolios, and I think this has to do a little bit with our emphasis on industrial and multifamily property types and being in the right submarkets even against the backdrop of rising rates we're seeing utilization rent increases reflected in NOI increases all up and to the right. And we have not seen any kind of color to give back on the value side. And that's generally what the experience has been historically in these asset classes. I think we're now uniquely positioned to benefit even more than we have in the past given the industrial exposures there. And so it really comes down to PE. And as I said in the prepared remarks we do have an orientation towards growth, but I would say it's more growth at a reasonable price. And so in theory as the discount rate resets one would expect to see some valuation implication in the portfolio. You saw that a little bit in our public exposures this quarter but our experience has been historically given that we tend to be a little bit less levered than the peer set. And given the rate of growth in those portfolios that the growth outpaces the value you give back and that's been our experience so far. And given the deployment percentage there to the extent that there's a reset, we'll have an ample opportunity to put capital work into that market. And I would clarify that's really just the corporate opportunities fund because our special opportunities funds are more credit-oriented and they're similarly benefiting from the floating rate positioning of those assets. So very few places in the existing exposures where interest rates in and of themselves are going to have a meaningful impact on the portfolio to the negative. \nKenneth Lee: Got you. Very helpful. And just one follow-up if I may. In terms of your wealth management solutions the distribution channel you talked about potentially seeing some impact on fundraising later this year. Just wondering if you could just expand upon that and just give a little bit more color around that? Thanks.\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. As we've talked about in terms of how we are building out that business we are expanding the distribution of our existing product in the channel. And I'm going to talk just about the non-traded putting aside the opportunity to grow the listed vehicles, but three existing funds being our two non-traded REITs and our credit interval fund they're showing nice sequential month-over-month, quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year growth. That's by getting deeper into the platforms that we're already on and it also comes with adding new platforms. And so depending on which fund we're talking about, we're either going deeper or we're going broader, part of the industrial logic to the Black Creek acquisition was the ability to leverage the relationships that we have at Ares with the larger platforms to broaden out the distribution of the non-traded REITs. And that's what I'm really referring to specifically when we look at it showing up in the back half of the year. It's really getting those REITs onto a number of new platforms. And then, there's a secondary growth engine, which is the launch of new product. And as I mentioned in this quarter, we've launched a new private markets fund around our private equity and secondary capability, which we hope will scale. And we have filed but not yet launched our non-traded BDC. And obviously, when that gets through the registration process, we have pretty high hopes just given our brand and position in the private credit space that will show some meaningful momentum in the back half of the year. The third thing we're working on is the globalization of the wealth management franchise. Up until today, it's been largely focused on North American distribution. And we've been building out our teams and capabilities across the Eurozone and APAC region to start globalizing the distribution as well.\nKenneth Lee: Great. Very helpful. Thanks. again.\nMichael Arougheti: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Finian O'Shea with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nFinian O'Shea: Hi, everyone. Good morning. A question on direct lending, where asset managers, peers are increasingly providing these rated note structures to insurers. Is the underlying originated paper overlapping with typical direct lending now and thereby, becoming a major competitor?\nMichael Arougheti: So the answer is it does, but I wouldn't say that's becoming a major competitor. I think you just have to think about people access direct lending assets through different mechanisms. You can access it through traded BDCs, you can access it through nontraded BDCs, you can access it through commingled fund structures. And if you're an insurance company, you can access it efficiently through rated note structures. But the structure in and of itself, as we're experiencing it, is not changing the competitive dynamic in the market. It's really just a structural opportunity for folks to access the market in a more effective way for them. But yes, the exposures would be very similar.\nFinian O'Shea: Okay. That's helpful. And then a follow-on on ARCC that was a little more active in follow-on equity offering or at the market offering this quarter. Can you talk about the outlook or if we should think about a certain cadence for growth there in the public BDC?\nMichael Arougheti: Kipp, do you want to take that one?\nKipp deVeer: Yeah, I'm happy to. I hope everyone can hear me. We \u2013 look, I mean, issuing equity at the BDC is something that we believe is good for the long-term health of that company. We continue to believe that emerging from COVID, we've gained a lot of competitive traction and are better positioned. As most would recall, we haven't raised equity in a material call cadence in seven years until we did a couple of follow-on transactions over the last 18 months. But ATM issuance is pretty common, I think, for our company and for most of the other BDCs along with a whole lot of REITs. We think it allows us to add a little bit of scale as we continue to grow into what's been an amazing growth opportunity for that company. So in terms of cadence here, there are limitations in terms of what you can do. Obviously, if then you followed the BDC, so you have a good sense for that \u2013 FTC, it's relatively small. It's just a way for us to continue to build capital scale there over time and to do it accretively.\nFinian O'Shea: Thank you, Kipp and Mike.\nMichael Arougheti: Thanks, Finian.\nOperator: The next question comes from Adam Beatty with UBS. Please go ahead.\nAdam Beatty: Thank you, and good morning. You mentioned being underpenetrated with your existing client base. And so I'm interested in maybe a little bit more detail around your thinking there and what you're seeing, particularly I guess, in the institutional channel, I sort of assume, maybe you'll correct me on this, that the retail and the newer insurance channel are underpenetrated, that makes sense. But in the institutional channel a lot of investors think of that in terms of being mature, being very penetrated. So just wondering whether in your mind, it's a question of kind of more of an allocation to alternatives or more of that allocation going to Ares and what might drive the penetration upward toward the potential for Ares? Thank you.\nJarrod Phillips: Sure. Adam, it's Jarrod. I just figured, I'd take this one. Overall, when we talk about penetration, we're talking about a lot of it is the number of funds that our investors are invested in. And right now, about 60% of the platform is one fund for the investor and the other 40%, about 35% of that is two through five. We're really seeking to broaden the number of funds that our LPs participate in. So we feel like we can really grow that greater than 5% from the sex percentage to a much higher number, which will allow us further penetration across their wallet gain wallet share and that's really driven things like the recent acquisitions we've made and the number of platforms that we have, that allow our LPs to come in and have a lot of different choices so that and to Mike's point earlier that it's not one commingled fund that we're really dependent on in our fundraising, but a number of different funds and a number of different offerings that we're able to penetrate our investor base into having a number of products with Ares.\nMichael Arougheti: Yeah. And you would see a similar breakdown, if you looked at it kind of by strategy. So we're cross-selling people across fund families and then across different parts of the business. The way you see this playing through in the math just to understand it is, if you look at number of investors in any given year, we've been running at roughly 50-50 in our institutional fund raising. So roughly, half of the investors that come on to the platform are new. But as I mentioned, maybe the 90% of the dollars are from existing. And so we're taking greater share. And then as people stay on the platform, they're investing more with us.\nAdam Beatty: Got it. Thank you for the context and planting out those numbers. I appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how your underwriting criteria has evolved in the current environment and how that looks today versus say a year ago?\nMichael Arougheti: It's a general question. And obviously, we do a lot of things here Mike, but I'm going to give you a general answer which is our underwriting is the same through market cycles, because if we're doing our jobs well and we're looking at the different scenarios going in, we've accounted for all the things that people are worried about now, whether that's ability to service debt, ability to pass-through prices, cost input increases. So the underwriting framework has not changed, nor would I expect it to and that's what's led us to be so successful over our 25 years investing through these different markets. That being said, obviously you'll over-index the analysis in an environment like this in terms of what risks you're willing to take and when you're willing to take them. But I'll give you the simple answer that I don't think that good investors change the way that they approach investing I think they change maybe the way that they're thinking about where they are in the cycle but that's a slightly different perspective.\nMichael Cyprys: I guess maybe to rephrase are you moving more senior in the cap structure? Are you shifting to more covenant type from covenant light? Just curious how you're thinking about kind of the credit book and how\u2026\nMichael Arougheti: Yeah, it depends on which part of the business that you're in. But when you get into a market where there is uncertainty, a lot of our strategies will do exactly what you just said which is derisk either through moving up the capital structure or putting more structural protections in place. Each of the different strategies is going to express that view differently. But the answer is, yes. And some of that is what you're willing to do and some of that is where you are in the market transition. So one of the reasons that transaction activity slows very early in this type of a market shift is folks like us will have a different view on the structural protections that we would require for a certain return. And then we have the price discover and structure discover in the market to see where things will clear. Once you then reset, you will begin to see the activity pick back up again. So I would say generally people are cautious in their positioning as is appropriate, but again not really a fundamental shift in underwriting.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. If I could just ask a follow-up question on the non-traded BDC and the retail private market secondary fund those two retail products that you guys are bringing to the marketplace. So I was hoping you could just maybe talk a little bit about how the products are going to be structured? And on the non-traded BDC side, how that sort of investment strategy differs from your existing BDC?\nMichael Arougheti: Yeah. So the private markets fund is a RIC structure that will be largely at least in the early scaling of that fund be leveraging our secondaries capability, maybe stating the obvious in order for the retail investor to access PE the way that they want to secondaries work just because it gets sort of the J curve and the administrative difficulties of capital calls and the like that you would need in a larger institutional wrapper. And that will be a nice complement to our flagship fund families, not just in the secondaries business, but also within our PE business as it grows. The non-traded BDC is interesting because to the earlier question around fundraising, ARCC is a very large pool of capital roughly $20 billion, but it is not accessing equity the way that the non-traded peer set is, it's actually a pretty interesting phenomenon just thinking about how public-listed BDCs access equity and grow versus public non-listed BDCs. So we do think that from a capital formation standpoint, it will be complementary to our private credit fund offerings. In terms of how it will look relative to the public BDC, really too early to tell, because we have actually launched the fund. But what I will tell you is the required return in the non-traded market is fundamentally different than the required return in the public market. And so by definition we would expect the asset mix and the non-traded BDC to look meaningfully different than what would be in the listed vehicle. I think we're in a unique position relative to the peer set to bring something unique into that market. As an example, if you look at our interval fund, which continues to scale nicely that has very broad-based exposures across the entirety of our liquid and illiquid credit platform all in one line item. And so I would expect to see a broader diversification across the platform in the non-traded side of the house versus the listed if I had to guess. \nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thank you.\nOperator:  The next question is a follow-up from Robert Lee with KBW. Please go ahead.\nRobert Lee: Thanks for taking my follow-up. Jarrod, I just had a couple of quick really kind of more modeling questions. But I did notice in the quarter, it seemed like the fee rate kind of came down a little bit. I don't know if there were just some timing issues there or anything we should be thinking about. And also I know sometimes seasonally 1Q could be a low tax rate around maybe restricted stock grant vesting or whatnot, but tax rate also seemed a little low. Can you maybe just kind of update us on expectations there? \nJarrod Phillips: Sure. I'd say on the fee rate, it's really a result of new products coming on to the portfolio something like the Aspida management fee at 30 bps is lower than our standard 1% fee rate. And then you also have some of the impact of the Part 1 fees as that fluctuates up and down that really adds a little bit to your fee rate. But in general, when you think about our standard product and our current launches the fees have been consistent. So it's really just a timing quarter-over-quarter. On the tax rate, I think, that that's -- it's a pretty consistent rate for what, I think, we guided to and it's pretty consistent to our total year-to-date rate from prior year. We expect to be in that let's call it 10% to 15% range on current taxes. And so I think that there are things to your point that move quarter-over-quarter that are a little bit harder to predict. But in general, we feel pretty good about that that range. \nRobert Lee: Great. That was it. Thank you.\nJarrod Phillips: Thanks, Rob.\nOperator: We have no further questions. So this concludes our question-and-answer session. And I'll turn the conference back over to Michael Arougheti for any closing remarks. \nMichael Arougheti: No. We just as always appreciate everybody's support and taking the time to spend with us today and look forward to giving people another update next quarter. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our conference call for today.

            "name": "Jarrod Phillips",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Hello everyone, and thank you for joining us. As Mike stated, despite the typical seasonal slowdown which was compounded by increased market volatility, we achieved strong year-over-year growth in management fees, fee-related earnings, realized income and RI per share of Class A stock. Our fundraising platform, continued to drive strong organic growth of $13.7 billion. When combined with the AMP acquisition, our AUM totaled $325 billion at quarter end, up over 6% in the quarter. Starting with our revenues, our quarterly management fees increased 47% year-over-year, due to strong growth in fee paying AUM. The stability of our management fees was evident, as 94% of our management fees came from either perpetual capital for long-dated funds which allows us to manage our assets with a long-term perspective. We had a small amount of fee-related performance revenues in the first quarter from our managed accounts and credit, but as we've stated previously we expect 90% plus of FRPR will come in the fourth quarter, as our retail funds and perpetual managed accounts typically crystallize their fees at year-end. Other fee income increased to approximately $20 million in the quarter, more than triple from the previous year with the increase driven predominantly by property development-related fees from our non-traded REITs in addition to our typical capital structuring and origination fees in certain of our direct lending perpetual funds. For the first quarter, we generated $205.7 million of FRE, an increase of 59% over the first quarter of 2021. And it accounted for over 90% of our realized income in the quarter. Our FRE margin for the first quarter totaled about 40% which was up slightly over the fourth quarter and up 150 basis points versus the first quarter of 2021. We believe we continue to be on track for our 20% compound annual growth in FRE and dividends per Class A common stock, through 2025 and our 45% plus target run rate FRE margin by the end of 2025. Due to the market volatility in the first quarter, realization activity was more modest with $15.3 million of realized performance income. However, our accrued net performance income increased 5.3% in the quarter and is up 100% year-over-year to $850.8 million, reflecting the strong performance of the portfolio and the growth in future realization potential. The increase was led by returns on our credit group which is largely based on cash yields from the portfolio. We expect a limited impact to asset prices from rising rates as 90% of our debt assets in our credit group are in floating rate instruments. We expect to benefit from the floating rate nature of these assets as interest rates increase further. Going forward, we believe the companies in our credit portfolio have built significant cushions to absorb the impact of rising inflation and interest rates. For example, our largest credit fund Ares Capital, which we believe is generally representative of much of our senior direct lending portfolio reported that its average loan to value in its portfolio was historically low at 44%, net interest coverage stood at 2.9 times which is above the 10-year average of 2.6 times. In addition the strong performance in our non-traded REITs in the first quarter drove an accrual on the REIT's balance sheet of $95.5 million of gross performance participation for Ares. While this value is not included in our accrued net performance income or our fee-related performance revenues since it remains subject to the fund's future returns it is a strong start to the year for these two funds. At our Investor Day, last year in August, we outlined the potential for $1.5 billion of net realized performance income, from European waterfall style funds based on the AUM we had in such vehicles at that time. Since our Investor Day, we've raised an additional $24.5 billion of AUM in European style waterfall funds that were not included in that forecast. Looking at our current accrued net performance income of $850.8 million, $531 million or just over 60% is in European-style waterfall funds. We believe a portion of this amount will be recognizable over the next few years and our second quarter's realizations in this area are already pacing ahead of our first quarter's levels. Realized income for the first quarter totaled $222 million up 62% from the first quarter of 2021. After-tax RI per share of Class A common stock was $0.65 for the first quarter, up from $0.46 in the first quarter of 2021. Turning to AUM and related metrics. Our assets under management totaled $325 billion, an increase of more than 6% from the fourth quarter and up 57% from $207 billion in the first quarter of 2021. Our AUM growth in the first quarter included $8.2 billion from the acquisition of AMP's infrastructure debt business. Our fee-paying AUM, totaled $199 billion at quarter end, an increase of approximately 6% from the fourth quarter and up over 55% from the first quarter of 2021. Our growth in fee-paying AUM was primarily driven by a meaningful deployment in our direct lending alternative credit, real estate debt and special opportunity strategies, which are paid on invested capital along with $5 billion in fee-paying AUM from the infrastructure debt acquisition. With market volatility likely to be a constant theme through 2022, we're well-prepared to take advantage of opportunities. Our available capital grew to a record $92.4 billion, an increase of over 62% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with $58.2 billion of AUM not yet paying fees that's available for future deployment and if deployed corresponds to potential annual management fees, totaling $557 million, which represents over 30% of our last 12 months total management fees. Our incentive-eligible AUM increased by 5% quarter-over-quarter and 54% year-over-year to $191.8 billion. Of this amount, $71.4 billion was uninvested at quarter end, which represents a meaningful amount of potential future value creation opportunities for us. Earlier in the first quarter, we opportunistically accessed the debt markets before the spike in interest rates and successfully issued $500 million of 30-year fixed rate senior notes with a coupon of 3.65%. Following this issuance our rating agencies have affirmed our company's investment-grade rating and we're well-positioned with ample liquidity and balance sheet light business model. We believe this business is well-prepared for any market uncertainty ahead of us. The combination of our management fee-centric business model, the perpetual and long-duration nature of our assets and a substantial portion of our AUM and credit-related or inflation-protected assets, we believe will serve to reduce the volatility in our core financial metrics. When coupling, our ample liquidity with our substantial amount of available capital of $92 billion, we believe we're well-positioned to be opportunistic in a potentially more attractive investing environment. I'll now turn the call back over to Mike for his thoughts and concluding remarks. Sure. Adam, it's Jarrod. I just figured, I'd take this one. Overall, when we talk about penetration, we're talking about a lot of it is the number of funds that our investors are invested in. And right now, about 60% of the platform is one fund for the investor and the other 40%, about 35% of that is two through five.

But in general, we feel pretty good about that that range. Thanks, Rob."

            "name": "Michael Arougheti",
            "content": "Thank you, Carl and good morning. I hope everyone is doing well. During 2021 and especially the fourth quarter, the financing markets were incredibly active which led to record investment activity for us across most of our strategies. During the first quarter of '22, the Fed stepped up its fight against inflation and we saw a sharp rise in interest rates. The beginning of a protracted war in Ukraine and prolonged lockdowns in China, added further uncertainty and volatility to the typically seasonally slow first quarter. As a result, across many markets, general transaction activity slowed, yet some financing activity that would typically have tapped the traded markets, shifted to the private markets, where there is more certainty of execution and increasing scale to manage larger transactions. At Ares, it is part of our DNA to navigate volatility and to find opportunities in transitioning markets. To that point, despite the challenging backdrop, we continued our strong growth in the first quarter across all of our key financial metrics. On a year-over-year basis, our management fees and fee-related earnings increased 47% and 59% respectively and our realized income increased 62%. Importantly, our fee-related earnings accounted for 93% of our realized income for the first quarter and over 81% for the last 12 months. Our core FRE growth of 59% is especially gratifying in the face of this volatility and we believe that our prospects remain bright for continued strong growth across all five of our business groups. With a record $92 billion of available capital to invest, a robust fundraising pipeline over the next 18 months and compelling fund performance, we believe that we have strong visibility for continued growth in earnings over the coming quarters and years. Despite increasing interest rates, the global search for reliable income continues unabated as investors are continuing to see premium returns over the liquid market equivalent with less volatility. During the first quarter, we raised $13.7 billion of gross capital as new and existing investors allocated funds across our broadening platform. Existing investors accounted for more than 90% of our direct capital raise during the first quarter and we expect this general trend to continue, as we remain largely underpenetrated with our existing investor base. We believe our continued strong growth, reflects our investment performance, the continued scaling of our existing strategies and our expanding offering of new investment strategies and solutions, designed to serve our clients. We continue to aggressively expand in all three of our distribution channels, institutional, retail and insurance to add investors and to capitalize on the long-running growth trends in these markets. Notable highlights for the first quarter, included additional closings for several commingled funds in the market, a $1.1 billion first close on our sixth European real estate opportunistic fund, $900 million for our sixth Asian special situations Fund, $1.1 billion across our two Landmark secondaries funds, $600 million for our special opportunities fund and $400 million for our new APAC direct lending fund. Our perpetual capital funds also continue to scale. And in the aggregate, we're 63% higher year-over-year, reaching $83 billion or more than 25% of our AUM. One notable first quarter highlight was the reopening of our core alternative credit open-ended fund, where we raised an additional $1.1 billion. Our forward Black Creek nontraded REITs, now branded as Ares REITs, also continue to scale and benefit from being part of the Ares platform. For the first quarter, our two nontraded REITs, saw inflows totaling $900 million and performance continues to be strong. Our credit interval fund also continues to scale with more than $0.5 billion of new commitments and collectively our perpetual capital flows totaled $5.8 billion in the first quarter.  So, looking out over the next 12 months, we expect to have more than 25 different commingled funds in the market including several of our largest flagship funds expected to launch toward year-end. We expect 2022 will be a solid year of fundraising but the timing of these large flagship fundraises will ultimately dictate the final tally for this year, versus next year and in relation to last year's record fundraising levels.  We ended the first quarter with $325 billion in AUM up 57% versus the same period a year ago. The vast majority of our AUM growth continues to be organic, but we have made strategic acquisitions in segments that we believe are experiencing significant investor demand and that present attractive growth opportunities. A great example of this is the acquisition of our new infrastructure debt platform which closed during the first quarter.  We believe that infrastructure needs globally will be significant in the coming decade driven by population and economic growth, increasing privatization of infrastructure assets the global energy transition and the shift to sustainable and digital infrastructure. The team is integrating well, we're having positive fundraising discussions and we expect to have more to report on this next quarter. We believe that our infrastructure debt business is uniquely positioned to meet the need for capital in this space by offering a variety of credit solutions across industries and geographies. We continue to expand our Ares Wealth Management Solutions business which we believe is the second largest wealth distribution platform owned by any alternative manager. The group now has over 105 professionals and we are seeking to expand our geographic reach into new overseas markets and to enhance our capabilities.  We continue to make progress increasing our distribution with wirehouses and large private banks and we expect to see this begin to reflect in fundraising later this year. On the new product front, we leveraged our secondary solutions experience to launch a new secondary private markets fund with more than $250 million including the seed backing of several institutional investors. In addition, we filed for a new nontraded BDC which is an area where we have significant experience as one of the largest BDC managers in the country. We continued our momentum in the first quarter raising over $2 billion in the retail channel and our retail AUM now stands at $56 billion at March 31. We expect retail fundraising will continue gaining momentum in the coming quarters and years.  Despite the seasonality and volatility that I discussed earlier, we were still active making investments across our strategies during the first quarter. Certain markets were more impacted temporarily by volatility and this created trading and special situations opportunities for us whereas other markets remained active which is driven by strong secular trends.  We demonstrated the flexibility, scale and breadth of our investment capabilities as we invested more than $16 billion for the first quarter which compares to just under $13 billion a year ago. In credit, we experienced a 30% year-over-year increase in deployment activity. We continue to focus on high-quality franchise assets that we expect will continue to grow and perform well throughout market cycles. To that point earlier this week, we entered into an agreement where our credit funds will purchase a $2.4 billion middle market direct lending portfolio from Annaly Capital Management. As a major player in the direct lending sector, we knew this portfolio quite well and this portfolio acquisition will serve to accelerate our deployment, provide incumbency benefits on new portfolio names and further solidify our relationships with existing and new sponsors. Deployment across real estate was also strong in the first quarter, up 90% year-over-year including the additional deployment we're seeing in our recently acquired industrial funds. In terms of fund performance rising inflation and interest rates had only a modest impact on certain segments of our portfolio for the first quarter. Real estate continued its strong performance as the US real estate equity composite generated gross returns in the first quarter of 10.4% and 68.1% for the last 12-month period and our European real estate equity composite had gross returns of 5% in the quarter and 32% for the last 12 months. Our US and European real estate portfolios continue to benefit from an overweighting to industrial and multifamily properties with significant underweights in office retail and hospitality. In our nontraded REITs, the performance remains excellent with AI-REIT generating a first quarter net return of 17.2% and A-REIT generating a first quarter net return of 7.5%. The performance in our nontraded REITs was driven by the strong trends in industrial and multifamily property types submarket selection across our portfolios, high rent growth and utilization rates and higher new rental rates on completion builds above our underwriting base cases.  All of these factors led to strong growth in net operating income across our assets. Within credit, our private credit strategy has generated strong returns in the quarter. Our flagship US direct lending fund, Ares Capital Corporation generated a net return of 2.7% in the first quarter and 19.1% for the last 12 months. Our European direct lending strategy generated steady gross returns of 2.3% for the quarter and 12.7% for the last 12 months. Our performance benefited from our asset selection with a focus on defensive industries, along with a predominantly senior secured floating rate portfolio. In liquid credit, we outperformed our benchmarks in our high-yield and global multi-asset strategies for the first quarter and 12-month periods with slight underperformance in syndicated loans in the first quarter driven by the inclusion of high-yield baskets in some of these portfolios. And in Asia, our special situations fund composite, generated a gross return of 0.6% in the quarter and 18.1% for the last 12 months. Our private equity returns continue to outperform the volatile public equity markets. Our ACOF composite, generated gross returns of negative 1% in the first quarter and positive 30% for the 12-month period, while Ares special opportunities generated gross returns of 2.4% in the first quarter and 36% for the last 12 months. Our secondary strategies also continued their strong performance, with private equity generating gross returns of 4.6% for the quarter and 43.5% for the trailing 12-month period, while real estate generated gross returns of 12.2% for the quarter and 54.5% over the trailing 12 months. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Jarrod to walk through the first quarter financial results, Jarrod? Thanks Jarrod. Over the past few months, we've received many questions from investors about how the business may be impacted by the uncertainties ahead of us. Ares is purpose built to not just withstand, but to excel during turbulent markets. We employ a management fee-centric model and an asset-light balance sheet, which helps drive stability. We invest primarily in floating rate credit assets in real assets that have some degree of inflation protection and we take a growth mindset in our private equity strategies, while using structural protections to protect downside risk. We also have extensive restructuring and distressed investing capabilities embedded in a variety of our strategies. We have a demonstrated track record during volatile markets and we've generated some of our fastest AUM and management fee growth through periods like the Great Financial Crisis and the recent COVID pandemic. For these reasons that we remain confident in our growth trajectory including our long-term AUM forecast of $500 billion or more by year-end 2025. I want to end by expressing my appreciation for all of the hard work and dedication of our employees around the globe. I'm also deeply thankful to all of our investors for their continued support of our company. Thanks for your time today. And operator with that we can open the line for questions. Hi, Craig. Sure. Thanks Craig. I'm glad you opened with that, because I think there's maybe a little bit of a misunderstanding about the durability of the private credit asset class in this type of environment. And what makes this so unique is we're going into this rate hike cycle with positioning at/or near all-time highs in terms of the credit quality of the book any way you look at it. So as Kipp talked about if you look at the year-over-year EBITDA growth within the ARCC portfolio, which is indicative of what we're seeing across the board we saw 20% year-over-year cash flow growth. I don't think that we've seen that before. That book is positioned with three times interest coverage against prior cyclical averages in the low 2s. We had almost record low nonaccruals at 1.2% at cost. We are entering at very low loans to value. And in that portfolio we were attaching at about 45% loan to value. So a significant amount of credit support below. And so while I understand that there are folks who are used to expecting credit deterioration in rising rate environments the reality is there's a long way to go before we would see a rise in rates materialize as increased defaults and even loss given default in the book. I think more importantly given the floating rate positioning of all of these private credit assets we would expect the next 100 or 200 basis points of rate increases to be significantly accretive not just to those portfolios but to the P&L of Ares Management. I think Kipp articulated on the ARCC call, that if you were to look at the existing positioning of that book the first 100 basis points we absorbed just based on the in-place LIBOR floors. But if you were to expect a 200 basis point increase in short-term rates that would increase their earnings in excess of 25% from where they are today. And I think that's a pretty consistent positioning across the board. I would drill down a little bit too whether we're talking about mortgage loans, infrastructure loans, corporate loans, we are the top of the capital structure in most if not all of these situations with control. And so I would not underestimate the value of that equity subordination that's reflecting those loans to value as we work through the market transition. So while there's a lot to be mindful of given everything that's happening in the economy, as well as the rate backdrop these tend to be pretty attractive markets for us. And one last thing, if folks want to look at public information if you go back and look at the last two periods of rate hikes, what you'll see both across the syndicated loan and high-yield market but also within the BDC space is that default performance through those periods of rate escalation were below historical averages and that's a combination of cash flow growth outpacing the rise in rates and the benefit of some of this equity subordination that I talked about. So I think we're in a pretty good spot. Yes. I would say it's an interesting distinction Craig because you look at an Annaly or an Allied and those are obviously inorganic but those project much more like portfolio purchases than some of the platform acquisitions that we've made, both are accretive both add value in different ways. We are seeing even in the early days of the market transition more opportunities and productive dialogue around asset portfolios today. And I think Annaly is a great example of that. Some of that is the liquidity position of other players in the market and some of it is in the case of our friends at Annaly kind of a repositioning and refocus on core strategies and I would expect we'll see more of them. Thanks, Craig. Do well. Sure. There's probably two or three things to unpack Rob, so I'll try to hit them in order. But maybe just as a quick reminder because we talk about an overarching secular trend in our market which is just the consolidation of share in the hands of the larger platforms across the alt landscape and that is continuing. So I think that folks like Ares are having a slightly different experience than maybe smaller or single asset managers. And I think that's being reflected in the fundraising. I think what you're referring to, which is something that we are seeing, but I would say it's largely as we're experiencing it in the private equity side of the house which is because of the active level of deployment that has occurred over the last couple of years a number of private equity managers are coming back to the market sooner than expected. And the entrenched GP base is spending more time, what I would say, re-underwriting re-ups and incumbent relationships versus new. And so, within the private equity part of the market, there are probably a number of managers who are not getting shelf space, because people are focused on re-ups, I think that will benefit, again, the larger more entrenched managers who have multiple products in the space. We are not experiencing that in other parts of the business. In our private equity business, the good news is, if that trend were to affect us, we just brought our second special ops fund out of the market at the hard cap and the ACOF fund family is not in the market today. That is a fund, to your latter question, Rob, that we would expect will be coming sometime towards the end of the year or early next year depending on deployment, that's about 50% deployed today. But we are not seeing any slowdown in the demand for the real asset side of the business or the credit side of the business. Uniquely, and we talked a lot about just the fundraising backdrop coming into this year, 2021 was a record year. We went in with similar commentary to what we told all of you at the beginning of this year, which is, we've got great momentum and great diversity of strategies and some of this will be timing. I think we had a really solid first quarter at $14 billion. But what's unique about the first quarter, for the first time in a long time, there's no flagship fund in there of scale. So what you'll see when you go through the earnings presentation, is just a broad distribution of capital gathering across a host of strategies, as well as that higher floor that we're now getting from our perpetual capital vehicles, retail vehicles and CLO franchise. And so, you're beginning to see the benefit of that diversification and retail positioning. The delta, as we get into the back half of this year, is to kind of how big of a year will it be relative to last year. And what we'll see next year is, really, a couple of big funds. One will be our European direct lending fund. Obviously, one of the larger fund families on the platform, significant market leadership position. Deployment has been ahead of pace and that is one that I could see coming back to market a little bit earlier. Similar with some of our flagship US private credit funds, our climate infrastructure fund, I mentioned, ACOF. So there's like a not insignificant number of the larger funds that we're probably looking at 2023 that may get pulled forward, based on deployment at that time. We'll see as we get through the year, it's really going to be a function of what the investment environment looks like and how the deployment pace picks up. Sure. I'm just going to -- I'm going to start with where you ended, because we hinted at this in the prepared remarks, because of the diversity of our strategies, we're deploying pretty consistently quarter-to-quarter. Where that deployment comes from is a function of what the market environment is. So if we're in an environment where new M&A transaction volume is lower, particularly within the private equity space that probably means that we're more actively deploying in our special sits opportunistic credit and alternative credit portfolios. And so, what's happening is, we're broadening out the scale and flexibility of the strategies. You're seeing more consistent deployment quarter-over-quarter. And you look at what we did in Q1 across the entire platform, both drawdown and non-drawdown funds, we put about $16.2 billion to work, which is 25% plus higher than the first quarter of 2021. So we'll only know out as we get into the year, because Q1 is seasonally slow. If you look at the ramp in transaction volume last year, a lot of that volume showed up in Q3 and particularly in Q4. So we're actually quite optimistic, given the year-over-year trend that the deployment pace will continue. We're not quite sure exactly where it's going to show up. Kipp, I think did a good job articulating some of the benefits of our market position in terms of deployment. We've articulated every quarter, the value of these incumbent relationships we have both within the existing portfolio and within the existing equity community. But Q1 is a good example two-third of the deployment of the BDC came from within the portfolio and that opportunity to continue to deliver capital into the names that we know as they either delever or scale, reduces reliance on the new issue and M&A market for deployment and that's a pretty meaningful differentiator for us given the way that our business is positioned versus someone who's more focused on new volumes. In other parts of our business we're just actually seeing share gains and share growth. So Europe, obviously, we have a different market share position there. The Asian markets are showing us slightly different opportunities. But everyone is deploying pretty well right now. And I want to just deemphasize a \"reliance on sponsor activity\" because I think the business has outgrown that. That said and Kipp could chime in here for things if he disagrees, the pipeline is actually starting to build on the PE side. We talked about this on the Q4 earnings call. I think Kipp appropriately articulated caution in terms of Q1 deployment relative to Q4, but we did say the mitigant to that is once you get through a repricing or rerating of the market given the amount of dry powder on the sidelines we would expect transaction activity to pick up. And at least as I'm sitting here today and looking at the shadow pipeline of deals building the private equity community is actually starting to pick up activity now that we're getting a better look at what the new valuation environment is. Yes. We cover direct lending so I won't beat that dead horse, but I do think it's an important takeaway for folks when you look at the amount of our exposures across the private credit landscape, they are all for the most part short duration floating rate assets that are through their floors. And that is going to be a pretty meaningful tailwind for us. If you look then at the real assets book there are inherent inflation hedges in that portfolio. On the credit side, they are similarly positioned on short duration floating rate assets. And on the equity side, I think, there's always a debate about the relationship between cap rates and interest rates. But I will tell you based on everything that we're seeing in the portfolios, and I think this has to do a little bit with our emphasis on industrial and multifamily property types and being in the right submarkets even against the backdrop of rising rates we're seeing utilization rent increases reflected in NOI increases all up and to the right. And we have not seen any kind of color to give back on the value side. And that's generally what the experience has been historically in these asset classes. I think we're now uniquely positioned to benefit even more than we have in the past given the industrial exposures there. And so it really comes down to PE. And as I said in the prepared remarks we do have an orientation towards growth, but I would say it's more growth at a reasonable price. And so in theory as the discount rate resets one would expect to see some valuation implication in the portfolio. You saw that a little bit in our public exposures this quarter but our experience has been historically given that we tend to be a little bit less levered than the peer set. And given the rate of growth in those portfolios that the growth outpaces the value you give back and that's been our experience so far. And given the deployment percentage there to the extent that there's a reset, we'll have an ample opportunity to put capital work into that market. And I would clarify that's really just the corporate opportunities fund because our special opportunities funds are more credit-oriented and they're similarly benefiting from the floating rate positioning of those assets. So very few places in the existing exposures where interest rates in and of themselves are going to have a meaningful impact on the portfolio to the negative. Sure. As we've talked about in terms of how we are building out that business we are expanding the distribution of our existing product in the channel. And I'm going to talk just about the non-traded putting aside the opportunity to grow the listed vehicles, but three existing funds being our two non-traded REITs and our credit interval fund they're showing nice sequential month-over-month, quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year growth. That's by getting deeper into the platforms that we're already on and it also comes with adding new platforms. And so depending on which fund we're talking about, we're either going deeper or we're going broader, part of the industrial logic to the Black Creek acquisition was the ability to leverage the relationships that we have at Ares with the larger platforms to broaden out the distribution of the non-traded REITs. And that's what I'm really referring to specifically when we look at it showing up in the back half of the year. It's really getting those REITs onto a number of new platforms. And then, there's a secondary growth engine, which is the launch of new product. And as I mentioned in this quarter, we've launched a new private markets fund around our private equity and secondary capability, which we hope will scale. And we have filed but not yet launched our non-traded BDC. And obviously, when that gets through the registration process, we have pretty high hopes just given our brand and position in the private credit space that will show some meaningful momentum in the back half of the year. The third thing we're working on is the globalization of the wealth management franchise. Up until today, it's been largely focused on North American distribution. And we've been building out our teams and capabilities across the Eurozone and APAC region to start globalizing the distribution as well. Thank you. So the answer is it does, but I wouldn't say that's becoming a major competitor. I think you just have to think about people access direct lending assets through different mechanisms. You can access it through traded BDCs, you can access it through nontraded BDCs, you can access it through commingled fund structures. And if you're an insurance company, you can access it efficiently through rated note structures. But the structure in and of itself, as we're experiencing it, is not changing the competitive dynamic in the market. It's really just a structural opportunity for folks to access the market in a more effective way for them. But yes, the exposures would be very similar.\nFinian O'Shea: Okay. That's helpful. And then a follow-on on ARCC that was a little more active in follow-on equity offering or at the market offering this quarter. Can you talk about the outlook or if we should think about a certain cadence for growth there in the public BDC? Kipp, do you want to take that one? Thanks, Finian. Yeah. And you would see a similar breakdown, if you looked at it kind of by strategy. So we're cross-selling people across fund families and then across different parts of the business. The way you see this playing through in the math just to understand it is, if you look at number of investors in any given year, we've been running at roughly 50-50 in our institutional fund raising. So roughly, half of the investors that come on to the platform are new. But as I mentioned, maybe the 90% of the dollars are from existing. And so we're taking greater share. And then as people stay on the platform, they're investing more with us. It's a general question. And obviously, we do a lot of things here Mike, but I'm going to give you a general answer which is our underwriting is the same through market cycles, because if we're doing our jobs well and we're looking at the different scenarios going in, we've accounted for all the things that people are worried about now, whether that's ability to service debt, ability to pass-through prices, cost input increases. So the underwriting framework has not changed, nor would I expect it to and that's what's led us to be so successful over our 25 years investing through these different markets. That being said, obviously you'll over-index the analysis in an environment like this in terms of what risks you're willing to take and when you're willing to take them. But I'll give you the simple answer that I don't think that good investors change the way that they approach investing I think they change maybe the way that they're thinking about where they are in the cycle but that's a slightly different perspective. Yeah, it depends on which part of the business that you're in. But when you get into a market where there is uncertainty, a lot of our strategies will do exactly what you just said which is derisk either through moving up the capital structure or putting more structural protections in place. Each of the different strategies is going to express that view differently. But the answer is, yes. And some of that is what you're willing to do and some of that is where you are in the market transition. So one of the reasons that transaction activity slows very early in this type of a market shift is folks like us will have a different view on the structural protections that we would require for a certain return. And then we have the price discover and structure discover in the market to see where things will clear. Once you then reset, you will begin to see the activity pick back up again. So I would say generally people are cautious in their positioning as is appropriate, but again not really a fundamental shift in underwriting. Yeah. So the private markets fund is a RIC structure that will be largely at least in the early scaling of that fund be leveraging our secondaries capability, maybe stating the obvious in order for the retail investor to access PE the way that they want to secondaries work just because it gets sort of the J curve and the administrative difficulties of capital calls and the like that you would need in a larger institutional wrapper. And that will be a nice complement to our flagship fund families, not just in the secondaries business, but also within our PE business as it grows. The non-traded BDC is interesting because to the earlier question around fundraising, ARCC is a very large pool of capital roughly $20 billion, but it is not accessing equity the way that the non-traded peer set is, it's actually a pretty interesting phenomenon just thinking about how public-listed BDCs access equity and grow versus public non-listed BDCs. So we do think that from a capital formation standpoint, it will be complementary to our private credit fund offerings. In terms of how it will look relative to the public BDC, really too early to tell, because we have actually launched the fund. But what I will tell you is the required return in the non-traded market is fundamentally different than the required return in the public market. And so by definition we would expect the asset mix and the non-traded BDC to look meaningfully different than what would be in the listed vehicle. I think we're in a unique position relative to the peer set to bring something unique into that market. As an example, if you look at our interval fund, which continues to scale nicely that has very broad-based exposures across the entirety of our liquid and illiquid credit platform all in one line item. And so I would expect to see a broader diversification across the platform in the non-traded side of the house versus the listed if I had to guess. No. We just as always appreciate everybody's support and taking the time to spend with us today and look forward to giving people another update next quarter. Thanks for the time."

            "content": "Yeah, I'm happy to. I hope everyone can hear me. We \u2013 look, I mean, issuing equity at the BDC is something that we believe is good for the long-term health of that company. We continue to believe that emerging from COVID, we've gained a lot of competitive traction and are better positioned. As most would recall, we haven't raised equity in a material call cadence in seven years until we did a couple of follow-on transactions over the last 18 months. But ATM issuance is pretty common, I think, for our company and for most of the other BDCs along with a whole lot of REITs. We think it allows us to add a little bit of scale as we continue to grow into what's been an amazing growth opportunity for that company. So in terms of cadence here, there are limitations in terms of what you can do. Obviously, if then you followed the BDC, so you have a good sense for that \u2013 FTC, it's relatively small. It's just a way for us to continue to build capital scale there over time and to do it accretively.\nFinian O'Shea: Thank you, Kipp and Mike."

As a reminder, this call is being recorded on Thursday, February 8, 2024. I'll now turn the call over to Greg Mason, Co-Head of Public Markets Investor Relations for Ares Management. Please go ahead, sir.\nGreg Mason: Good morning. And thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter and year-end 2023 conference call. I'm joined today by Michael Arougheti, our Chief Executive Officer; Jarrod Phillips, our Chief Financial Officer; and Carl Drake, who has moved to a new advisory role within our Public Markets Investor Relations team. We also have a number of executives with us today who will be available during Q&A. Before we begin, I want to remind you that comments made during this call contain forward-looking statements and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those identified in our risk factors in our SEC filings. Our actual results could differ materially, and we undertake no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Please also note that past performance is not a guarantee of future results, and nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Ares fund. During this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Please refer to our fourth quarter and full year earnings presentation available on the Investor Resources section of our website for reconciliations of the measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Note that we plan to file our Form 10-K later this month. This morning, we announced that we declared a new higher level of quarterly dividends, starting with our first quarter common dividend of $0.93 per share on the company's Class A and nonvoting common stock, representing an increase of 21% over our dividend for the same quarter a year ago. The dividend will be paid on March 29, 2024, to holders of record on March 15. Jarrod will provide additional color on the drivers of this increase later in the call. Now I'll turn the call over to Mike, who will start with some fourth quarter and year-end business highlights.\nMichael Arougheti: Great. Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I hope everybody is doing well. We're pleased to report that we ended a great year of execution on many fronts with a very strong fourth quarter. Despite a difficult year for fundraising across our industry, we experienced strong demand for our funds, raising more than $74 billion in 2023, including more than $21 billion in the fourth quarter. This was our second largest fundraising year, and it was a record amount of capital raised directly from institutional investors. We entered 2024 in the enviable position of having more than $110 billion in dry powder to invest in what we believe is an attractive vintage, providing the opportunity to drive strong earnings growth in the years ahead.  In the fourth quarter, transaction activity picked up as market participants gained greater certainty with respect to interest rates and the economy. Against this backdrop, we were able to leverage our growing investment platform to record our strongest quarter of deployment for the year, which matched our second highest quarter on record. Our Q4 deployment jumped more than 40% compared to our third quarter, and we're encouraged that higher-than-typical levels of activity for this time of year have spilled over into the first quarter. We also continued to deliver strong relative investment performance for the year. And in fact, our U.S., Europe and Asia direct lending strategies generated double-digit returns in 2023. We believe that our consistent performance through cycles is resonating with investors, and our LPs are committing additional dollars across our broad set of strategies. For the year, we drove double-digit growth across many of our key financial metrics, including 19% growth in AUM and management fees and 17% growth in our fee-related earnings. I'd add that our fee-related earnings, excluding FRPR, increased by more than 20% year-over-year. We believe that our ability to generate this level of fee-related earnings growth in a market where M&A activity was down over 35% speaks to the resiliency of our management fee-centric business. Going forward, we believe that we are headed for another strong year as Jarrod will walk you through a little later in the call, but I do want to highlight a few key points. First, we believe that the expectation for lower interest rates and better-than-expected economic growth is viewed as a significant relief for the deal markets. And we expect it will help drive higher transaction activity to start the year. We also believe that other factors like the aging of private equity dry powder and the demands by LPs to return capital are also supportive of higher activity. Fortunately for us, we believe that we're well positioned for a pickup in deployment activity due to the significant investments that we've made, adding 230 net investment professionals since the peak in market activity in 2021. We've built an origination engine that's capable of doing much more and an increase in market activity should enable us to drive efficiencies across our greater headcount of investment professionals. Secondly, we believe that we're approaching a step function in the growth of our net realized performance income. We're nearing an inflection point and a recognition of net realized performance income from our European waterfall funds that have been performing and growing since 2017. And therefore, we expect to ramp up this year and an acceleration in 2025 and beyond. As an added benefit, if market transaction activity does in fact improve, we could see more of this income pulled forward from realizations, but it's still too early to make that call. Overall, we believe our business is well positioned to operate in a variety of market environments. We're resilient in tougher, slower markets but can see deployment and realizations accelerate during more active market environments. Third, we have a lot of momentum with our investors as we experience strong demand for not only our private credit strategies but also our opportunistic real estate, real estate debt and our secondary strategy offerings. In 2024, we believe that we're set up for yet another strong year of fundraising as some of our largest fundraises spilled over into the new year, and we're launching several new large funds with expected closings this year. Let me walk you through some recent activities to provide insights on where we stand heading into the new year. For the fourth quarter, the $21.1 billion we raised was our third highest quarter on record and just slightly behind what we raised in Q3. In our credit strategies, we continue to make great progress, raising our third U.S. senior direct lending fund with another $1.8 billion in new equity commitments in Q4, bringing the total equity commitments to $8.3 billion at year-end with total investment capacity of $15.2 billion, including anticipated leverage. We've already surpassed the $8 billion in LP commitments from our previous vintage, and we anticipate a final close in the second quarter with the ability to add further leverage capacity thereafter. Our sixth European direct lending fund raised another \u20ac1.3 billion in equity commitments and a \u20ac2.5 billion leverage facility during the fourth quarter. With over \u20ac550 million closed thus far in the first quarter, our equity commitments for this new fund now total \u20ac11 billion. And with anticipated leverage, the fund has over \u20ac16 billion of investable capital. We've essentially matched the size of the previous vintage, and we expect further upside into a final close later in 2024. Pathfinder II held a final close in October, only seven months after its first close. The fund received $6.6 billion in total commitments, surpassing our $5 billion target. The fund hit its hard cap and was almost 80% larger than its predecessor fund. And as with its predecessor fund, Pathfinder II is structured with a unique charitable tie-in whereby at least 10% of the carried interest will be donated by Ares and the team to support global health and education initiatives. To date, the Ares Pathfinder family funds have generated returns that would result in approximately $19 million of charitable contributions. We raised another $900 million in equity commitments for our fourth U.S. opportunistic real estate equity fund bringing total commitments to over $2 billion, exceeding the previous vintage. Within real estate, we also raised another $500 million in debt and equity commitments in our European real estate debt strategy, bringing total assets to approximately $2.4 billion. Within private equity, we raised $1.4 billion of commitments during Q4, and we\u2019ll continue our fundraising throughout most of 2024. In secondaries, we held a final close for our Real Estate Fund IX, raising $3.3 billion in commitments, inclusive of affiliated co-invest vehicles. This latest fundraise matched the size of the predecessor fund, which was the largest real estate secondaries fund closed in the market to date. We now have completed the top two largest real estate secondaries fundraisers, which puts us in a great market position. Fundraising in the wealth management sector continues to be an area of focus, and we see significant growth potential here over the next decade. We\u2019re starting to see an acceleration within the wealth management channel as our broadening set of products is attracting a growing number of distribution partners. For the fourth quarter, we raised $1.3 billion in equity commitments. For the full year, we raised $3.6 billion in equity commitments and nearly $5 billion, including debt commitments. According to third-party industry data, we were ranked in the top three among the public alternative managers and overall wealth management fundraising in 2023 as we were able to gain market share in a difficult environment. Our strong momentum in the fourth quarter has carried over into January as we had our largest month ever for wealth inflows, totaling over $600 million across our six products. Now after putting in place the infrastructure over the past 18 months, we\u2019re also set to see our international fundraising efforts materially increase in the first half of this year. Let me walk through an update on a few of these wealth products. Our non-traded BDC ASIF raised nearly $500 million in equity commitments during the fourth quarter. And our European equivalent ASIF raised over $150 million closing on January 2. During January, these two funds raised an additional $350 million in the aggregate, which underpins our expectation for continued strong fundraising in the wealth channel during 2024. Within private equity, we\u2019re now seeing a significant ramp in our Ares Private Markets Fund or APMF, which launched on its first wire house in September and raised roughly $240 million in the fourth quarter. And with over $800 million in assets today, the fund is continuing to gain scale and momentum. Our two non-traded REITs raised $273 million combined in the fourth quarter and more than $1.3 billion for the full year. Both funds continued to generate positive net flows for both Q4 and the full year as we meaningfully outperformed the overall non-traded REIT market on a net flow basis. Another area of high strategic focus is our affiliated insurance business. Aspida finished the year with nearly $12.5 billion in assets, more than doubling its $6 billion in AUM at the beginning of last year. And we remain on track with our target of $25 billion in AUM by the end of 2025. Aspida has now achieved operational scale and is generating attractive returns for both annuity holders and Aspida equity investors. We had very strong deployment in the fourth quarter totaling $24 billion, matching our second highest quarter on record. Fourth quarter deployment across the credit group increased nearly 60% over the third quarter driven by strong results from our U.S. and European direct lending and alternative credit groups. Jarrod will discuss our fund performance in more detail, but our investment portfolios continue to be in excellent shape. We continue to see strong EBITDA growth across our credit and private equity portfolios. And in fact, we saw an acceleration of EBITDA growth to approximately 8% year-over-year within our U.S. direct lending segment. Our corporate credit portfolios, which were more than 95% invested in senior debt at the end of the year, continue to have low defaults and lower-than-historical levels of loan-to-value. Our global real estate portfolio continues to experience resilient fundamentals due to our allocation to the best performing sectors with 50% of the gross portfolio in industrial assets, 24% in multifamily and another 13% in similar adjacent sectors like student housing and self-storage. We\u2019re meaningfully underweight in U.S. office at about 4% of our total real estate portfolio and less than 1% of our AUM. Our opportunistic real estate and special opportunities teams recently formed a joint venture with a leading owner and investor in commercial real estate in New York. The JV has commitments of $500 million, and we\u2019ll seek to invest in high-quality distressed office buildings in New York as capital for the asset class has become increasingly scarce. And now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jarrod for additional commentary on our financial results and our outlook for the year. Jarrod?\nJarrod Phillips: Thanks, Mike, and hello, everyone. Despite a difficult market backdrop for deployment and monetizations, we experienced double-digit year-over-year growth in nearly every key financial metric, including management fees, fee-related earnings, realized income, AUM and FPAUM. Our management fees increased 19% for both the fourth quarter and for the full year driven primarily by strong deployment of our invested capital, especially within our global direct lending and alternative credit strategies. In the fourth quarter, FRE totaled $369 million, an increase of 10% from the fourth quarter of 2022 despite a steep decline in FRPR from real estate funds that contributed $65 million in FRE in 2022. For the full year, FRE exceeded $1 billion for the first time in our company\u2019s history and increased 17% from the prior year. Of course, our year-over-year FRE growth was partly impacted by the fact that we did not generate any FRPR from our non-traded REITs as we expected. Our FRE, excluding the FRPR specifically from our real estate non-traded REITs, increased 25% over 2022, a little ahead of our 20%-plus guidance that we provided a year ago. Our FRE-rich earnings remain a key differentiator for Ares as FRE again accounted for more than 90% of our realized income in 2023. Our FRE margin totaled 41% for the quarter and 40.9% for the full year. Excluding FRPR, which has a lower margin due to the contractual compensation ratio we\u2019ve discussed in the past, our core FRE margin was 41.8% for the fourth quarter, which was up 120 basis points versus the comparable margin a year ago. With over $74 billion raised in 2023 and an available capital balance of over $110 billion, we expect to see continued margin expansion as we deploy our capital. We continue to believe that we\u2019re on track to reach our goal of roughly 45% core FRE run rate margin by the end of 2025. Let me turn to our fee-related performance revenues or FRPR. FRPR totaled $180 million in 2023 compared to $239 million in 2022. In the fourth quarter, FRPR from our credit group totaled $166 million, which was about $46 million above the high end of the guidance we provided on last quarter\u2019s conference call. A large part of this outperformance was driven by higher-than-expected loan pricing as a result of tighter credit spreads as well as positive currency movements into year-end. The remainder of our FRPR was generated in our secondaries group from APMF, a retail-focused product. We are excited about the momentum for APMF and could see growing contributions to FRPR as the fund scales. As I mentioned, we did not generate FRPR from our two non-traded REITs during 2023. And both AREIT and AIREIT will need to make up for negative returns in 2023 before earning any FRPR. Fundamentals across these real estate funds remain resilient, however. We will likely need to see interest rates moderate and cap rates stabilize before these funds can generate additional FRPR. For this reason alone, it is more likely that we would see FRPR from the two non-traded REITs resume in 2025 as opposed to 2024. Our realization activity increased significantly in the fourth quarter compared to Q3 with realized net performance income totaling $77 million in the quarter, including $57 million from European-style waterfall funds. For full year, nearly 70% of our realized net performance income came from European waterfall style funds. In addition, we also generated net realized performance income from incentive fees, which occur on a regular basis that are not derived from perpetual funds. In 2023, we generated $27.5 million in net realized performance income from non-European style incentive fees, up from $20 million in 2022. As I talked about before, the European-style waterfalls are relatively predictable within a given time horizon, but can vary as to the exact quarter in which they\u2019ll be received with the fourth and second quarters typically the most common for larger amounts. We\u2019re reviewing last quarter\u2019s estimate for 2024, European waterfall style net realized performance income, we recognized about $13 million that was pulled forward into this fourth quarter. That said, our expectations for the next two years are modestly higher with approximately $420 million of net performance income from European-style waterfall funds. Of this amount, we expect approximately $145 million in 2024 and $275 million or more in 2025. Over the long term, we\u2019re targeting more than $3.5 billion of net realized performance income over the life of these European-style funds already raised. As we have discussed, the timing of the early fee recognition depends on \u2013 partially on March \u2013 market transaction activity levels. In 2023, our balance of net accrued performance fees increased 10% to $919 million and nearly $700 million of this amount with an EU-style waterfall funds. The increase was largely driven by the deployment of incentive-eligible AUM that yields in excess of the hurdle rates leading to growth of our incentive-generating AUM and the compounding of higher floating rates, particularly in our private credit funds. Realized income for the fourth quarter totaled a record $434 million and for the full year, realized income exceeded $1.2 billion, a 12% increase from 2022. For the full year 2023, our effective tax rate on our realized income was 9.1%. Last year, we benefited from tax deductions related to the exercise of options by employees. These options were granted as part of the IPO and are set to expire on the 10th anniversary of our IPO this year. As a result, only a trivial amount of these options remain unexercised. And accordingly, significant related tax deductions associated with the options will not recur. Therefore, we anticipate an effective tax rate on our realized income to be in a more normalized range of 12% to 15% in 2024. As of year-end, our AUM totaled nearly $419 billion, up 19% over the previous year and was driven almost entirely by organic growth. Our fee-paying AUM totaled nearly $262 billion at year-end, an increase of 13% from year-end 2022. Our available capital totaled $111.4 billion. So we have nearly $63 billion of AUM not yet paying fees available for future deployment, representing over $621 million in incremental potential future management fees. As Mike highlighted, our portfolios continue to perform very well. For the full year, we experienced double-digit returns in our U.S., Europe and Asia direct lending strategies as well as in our special opportunity strategy. Within real assets, our infrastructure strategies performed in line with expectations, delivering a high single-digit return in volatile [ph] markets. In real estate, our returns were impacted by higher cap rates and interest rate volatility, which pressured valuation. However, the underlying property fundamentals remained resilient, and we believe we are well positioned to generate strong performance once cap rates stabilize. For example, in 2023, our industrial portfolio saw a 50% rent growth on the same-store new and renewal lease rates, and our multifamily portfolio continue to see positive rent growth. Now let me provide some comments on our go-forward outlook and our new dividend level. We anticipate that our fundraising momentum will continue with additional closes on our large fundraises and process, as Mike stated earlier, coupled with recent or expect to launch this year of four more significant fund series across our strategies. We expect these larger fundraises will be supported by our ongoing and growing inflows from smaller co-mingled funds, wealth management funds, insurance, SMAs and other open- and closed-end vehicles. In fact, we expect to have approximately 35 different funds in the market across 17 of our strategies in 2024. Although it will be unlikely that we match the amount we raised in 2023, we expect it to be another strong year. And we are already well ahead of our pace to reach our target of $500 billion in AUM by the end of 2025. Keep in mind that our fee-related earnings trajectory is more dependent on the pace of our deployment rather than fundraising activity. With a record amount of dry powder, we\u2019re well positioned for higher deployment if market activity levels remain strong. This leads me to our dividend. At the beginning of each year, we set our quarterly dividend at a fixed level for the coming year. Based on the significant outperformance of our fee-related earnings relative to our dividends and our strong growth prospects for FRE this year, we\u2019ve elected to increase our quarterly dividend to $0.93 per share on the company\u2019s Class A and non-voting common stock, a 21% increase compared to 2023. Finally, we continue to be on track with our 2021 Investor Day guidance of FRE and dividend per common share growth of 20% or more through 2025. And I\u2019m pleased to announce that on May 21, we will hold another Investor Day to coincide with the 10-year anniversary of our public listing on the New York Stock Exchange. At that time, we\u2019ll provide an update on our business goals and objectives. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Mike.\nMichael Arougheti: Great. Thanks, Jarrod. In closing, we believe that we\u2019re very well positioned for the year ahead with a record amount of dry powder, a more promising market outlook, an expanded and more diversified investment platform and a strongly performing portfolio. The investments that we\u2019ve made in new personnel, new strategies, new vehicles and new distribution across the platform over the past few years beginning to contribute more meaningfully to our business. For example, we\u2019re seeing momentum in our insurance, wealth management, infrastructure, secondaries and Ares Asia platforms. Our fund performance also continues to be a source of differentiation, and our brand is strengthening with our investors and prospective portfolio companies. Collectively, our business is positioned to deliver strong relative returns for our fund investors, drive further growth in assets under management and create better operational efficiencies in the years to come. And as Jarrod mentioned, when you combine our strong FRE growth prospects with the inflection point that we\u2019re now reaching with our European waterfall realizations, we\u2019re poised to generate meaningful realized income in the years ahead. I continue to believe that one of our greatest differentiators is our people and our culture. And as always, I\u2019m so proud and grateful for the hard work and dedication of our employees across the globe. I\u2019m also deeply appreciative of our investors\u2019 continuing support for our company. And with that, operator, I think we could now open the line for questions.\nOperator: Yes sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. \nSteven Chubak: Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. So, I wanted to start off with one just on the Alt Credit outlook. Just given some expectation that Basel III end game proposal could get watered down, I was hoping to get your perspective on the deployment opportunity in Alt Credit. Do you still see a substantial opportunity in areas like ABF and red cap trades despite some of that potential softening? And what are you hearing from your bank partners specifically?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, it\u2019s a good question. We\u2019ve talked about this before. Obviously, we were early, I think, in identifying the growing opportunity in alternative credit. I think it\u2019s important that people appreciate like so many things happening in private credit right now with both secular and cyclical. So a lot of the secular trends that have been driving more capital formation in Alt Credit actually started post the GSE with the dismantling of the larger securitization apparatus on the street and the proliferation of smaller finance companies in the wake of the GSE. And that trend, call it, the first wave has been very much intact for the last 10 years and has given us a nice backdrop to grow what we think is a market-leading business there. Obviously, now with Basel III and some of the challenges that I think we all saw emerge in the banking sector generally early last year, there is an accelerated cyclical opportunity, obviously, to partner with banks largely in our Alt Credit business to help them navigate some of their balance sheet challenges. And that\u2019s been a keen area of focus, but not an exclusive area of focus. We talked on our last call about a sizable partnership transaction that we did with PacWest. We were public about a recent trade that we did on the risk transfer side. And those dialogues are ongoing and continuing. And I actually think that they will continue regardless of the resolution of Basel III end game. I think what we learned coming out of the struggles in the sector were largely structural. And once we get past this first phase of balance sheet restructuring and repositioning, I think you\u2019re going to have a lot of banks, regional, super regional and GSIBs just rethinking core businesses and balance sheet positioning. And we put ourselves out there as a proven partner for them as they go through that. So, I think it\u2019s \u2013 it bodes well for continued deployment. And we had a very strong fourth quarter in Alt Credit. We\u2019re seeing that activity level spill over into the New Year, and I\u2019d expect that to continue.\nSteven Chubak: That\u2019s great. Appreciate all the color. And for my follow-up, Jarrod, I was hoping to dig into some of the drivers of the dividend increase and especially in light of some of the constructive comments you made on FRE and deployment. Just given the magnitude of the increase, assuming a normal 75% payout, some modest share creep, it does imply close to 30% FRE growth in the coming year. Just wanted to get a sense that, that\u2019s a reasonable expectation for FRE expansion. Maybe just help unpack some of the drivers of that FRE uplift.\nJarrod Phillips: Sure. And I think when we set our dividend policy out back in 2021, one of the things we articulated was that we pegged it with FRE, but didn\u2019t necessarily match it perfectly to FRE. So as FRE grows, so do we expect the dividend to grow. And for the last couple of years, as I think everyone knows, we\u2019ve had outpaced FRE growth against the dividend growth. And so certainly, that gives us a bit of a tailwind as we\u2019re determining what the dividend is. And as we look forward, and we expect a positive year of deployment, especially with what we saw in the fourth quarter and what we\u2019ve seen in terms of some of the trends so far this year, that gives us a lot of assurance in setting our FRE expectations as well as the dividend expectations for the year. And then you combine that with some of the EU waterfall guidance that we provided, and we know that we\u2019ll have adequate coverage in terms of what we generate for the year to establish that. So it\u2019s not necessarily a one for one, and we haven\u2019t historically targeted a 75% or a 90% ratio of what we would pay out for our dividend. So, we feel good at that 20% or more level. And we feel like that it is indicative of the positivity we have around FRE growth as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Morning, Mike, Jarrod. Hope everyone\u2019s doing well.\nMichael Arougheti: Morning. \nCraig Siegenthaler: So our first one is on ASIF. It raised around $2 billion last year. And it sounds like that momentum carries on in January with another $350 million. So, I wanted to see if you could give us an update on how many platform shelves the U.S. and European vehicle sit on today? And how many platforms do you expect them to be on by year-end? And also, overall, how important is your long-term track record with ARCC in terms of speeding up the ramp with gatekeepers and advisers?\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. Good question. Just to clarify, Craig, the $350 million was both ASIF and its European counterpart, but obviously, strong numbers relative to the momentum that we saw building into the end of the year. I do think that both ASIF and AESIF are benefiting from our long successful track record at scale in the public markets. Obviously, as the market leader in direct lending and having run BDCs through cycles, I think that, that is definitely a tailwind. And I think if you look at the early fundraising momentum that we\u2019re enjoying both of those funds that compares well to competitor product. One of the reasons that we are so excited right now, both of those products are actually only on one platform. We had our first wealth closing in ASIF in August, and we actually now are expecting to add a significant number of new partners throughout the year, both in the U.S. and overseas, Europe and Asia. So I think you\u2019ll see that selling group increase dramatically as we get through the rest of the year. And needless to say that, that should result in some pretty good fundraising momentum. Similarly, on AESIF, we have one partner, and our expectation is that we\u2019ll probably add two or three there as well in Q2 or Q3 of this year.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Mike, that\u2019s great. And let me just stick with the semi liquids here with AIREIT and AREIT. How do you expect redemption requests to trend as it looks like investors send them in real estate may have reached an inflection? And also, we did receive some positive guidance on redemptions from your major competitor two weeks ago. And then following a potential decline in redemptions, how quickly do you expect sales to snap back just given that they\u2019re currently depressed?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, it\u2019s interesting. I think \u2013 and we said this in the prepared remarks, we\u2019re quite pleased with our performance relative to the rest of the non-traded REIT product in 2023, which was a difficult year just given performance headwinds and some of the redemption conversation around some of our larger peers. But if you look at the performance of both of the REITs, we actually had positive flows in the quarter and throughout the year, which I think is an outlier. I think that\u2019s a combination of the positioning of those funds. There are some unique attributes in terms of our 1031 Exchange product that I think is a little stickier. Those funds are less leveraged. So, we\u2019re going into 2024, obviously, having seen reduced sales but having positive net flows in both of those products. And my expectation would be that as some of the peer performance improves and people begin to feel like we\u2019re hitting bottom on cap rates and interest rates that you\u2019ll begin to see sales pick up there. So again, it\u2019s still early. Our experience in January would tell us that the sales are still there. But I think once we get to a place where interest rates are moderating and the redemption narrative within the peer set has moderated that we\u2019ll see ourselves accelerate as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt, Autonomous Research.\nPatrick Davitt: Hey, good morning, everyone. How are you? My first question is on kind of first quarter trends. The ARCC call highlighted current refinancing boom could be a headwind for net deployment in the quarter as M&A deal volumes are still picking back up. What are you guys seeing in terms of that give and take between new deal volume and refinancing outflows as the broadly syndicated and how yield market opens back up. And in that vein, are you seeing borrower interest and direct lending the ship at all yet? Thank you. \nMichael Arougheti: Sure. I want to clarify some of the comments that were made on the ARCC call, because that is not how I would interpret the commentary. There is a give and take in the market generally that when the markets are accelerating in activity, the banks will get more active, syndicated loan and high-yield market will open up and the CLO machine will turn on. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing because that means that transaction activity is picking up, and there\u2019s an opportunity to drive higher volumes and higher fees. I think it\u2019s important that people appreciate at least from the Ares [ph] and ARCC perceive is that we continue to have a very, very strong focus on the traditional middle market. It\u2019s a very big part of what we do across the globe. And I think there\u2019s a little bit of a misunderstanding that a lot of the growth has come from share gains from the syndicated loan and high-yield market. And as long as we\u2019ve been doing this, yes, there are moments in time when the loan market is closed. And at the higher end of the middle market, private credit providers can take share and then obviously, when the markets heal, activity levels pick up. But unlike some of our larger peers, we are not dependent on a transfer of market share from the liquid markets in order to continue to drive the growth and performance that we\u2019ve seen. So to clarify, I think, the commentary, I would say the enhanced levels of activity and turning back on of the deal market writ large, I think, right now is significantly more of a positive than a negative. There are significant, what I would call mitigants to refinancing in the private markets unlike the liquid markets that tend to just be price-driven. A lot of that is just relationships. So if you look at our deployment, for example, in 2023, 57% of our deployment in 2023 was to incumbent borrowers. That relationship is critically important and is actually protective of the portfolio. And then when you look at the amount of upfront fees, call protection, et cetera, that exist in these private credit instruments, even as spreads are tightening and capital is flowing into the liquid market, the economics of refinancing take a while to find their way into the market. So, I think as we\u2019re sitting here today, I would say it\u2019s actually a net positive. We\u2019re seeing increased transaction activity, more liquidity in the market. And I think that\u2019s generally a good thing. So, I heard some of the commentary on the call yesterday. I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re looking at a return to normal in the liquid markets is bad for the Ares Credit business. I\u2019d also highlight that we are one of the largest liquid credit managers and CLO managers as well. So from the Ares management perspective, as that market opens up, we\u2019re a big beneficiary as well.\nPatrick Davitt: Great. Thanks. And then a quick follow-up. Obviously, we get a ton of detailed data on U.S. direct lending portfolios. But could you give us a little bit more detail on how the European portfolios are tracking versus the U.S.? Are you seeing any signs that these portfolios could diverge versus the strong outcomes we\u2019ve been seeing in the U.S. portfolios? Thanks. \nMichael Arougheti: Yes. It is remarkably similar. If you look at the EBITDA numbers that were quoted for the ARCC portfolio is about an 8% year-over-year EBITDA growth that had accelerated from 6% in the prior quarter. If you look at the European direct funding, which is actually pretty amazing, year-over-year EBITDA growth was 18%. LTVs are a little bit higher. They\u2019re kind of in the 48% range in Europe versus 42%, 43% in Europe. Interest coverage is a little bit higher in Europe, 1.8% versus 1.6%. But if you just take all of the different ways to articulate credit exposure, they're largely similar. But we're seeing a surprising amount of momentum and resilience within the fundamental revenue and EBITDA portfolio in Europe right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Budish from Barclays.\nNick Benoit: Hey, good morning. This is Nick Benoit on the line for Ben this morning. So in the prepared remarks, the nonaccruals continue to remain low. I believe Kipp noted on the ARCC earnings call yesterday, the nonaccrual rate \u2013 historical nonaccrual rate is about 3%. So how do we kind of think about the macro backdrop for nonaccruals to return back to historic average about 3%? And do you kind of think there's been almost a reset in the direct line portfolio where normalized nonaccruals will stay lower for longer?\nMichael Arougheti: It's a good question. I think Kipp articulated it well, which is just by definition, given the rate backdrop and the assumption that rates will stay higher for longer, I think you will see an uptick in defaults, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. And what we keep trying to focus people on is the structural improvement in the leverage lending market, particularly the private credit market in terms of the amount of equity subordination in a lot of these capital structures. And so if you look at loans to value of 42% or 48%, when you look at the structure of the private equity market, there's about $3.5 trillion of private equity sitting at the bottom of a lot of these capital structures with $1 trillion of dry powder to protect value. And so I think part of what you are seeing is that even if there's a nonaccrual, many of these are unlike prior cycles where you have fundamental underperformance at the company level. They're being driven by higher rates for some of the better performing companies that were able to access more leverage. And those are a lot easier to resolve, both in terms of modification and amendment. But they're also the first places that capital coming in from the private equity sponsors to protect the value below you. I would say the industry is obviously running higher than we are. I think that we continue to outperform from a credit standpoint. But we're at peak rates. The economy continues to be strong. So if rates stay at this level, I would expect that to tick up a little bit, but I don't think that we're going to return to historical levels.\nNick Benoit: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nLuke Bianculli: Hi all, thanks for taking the question. This is Luke on for Alex. I wanted to get a sense for how you're thinking about the growth trajectory of the business outside of credit. And if we can dig into secondaries in particular, you alluded to the state of LP liquidity across the industry. How does that factor in? And outside of that, what do you view as key drivers of growth for the business? Thanks.\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. Obviously, we have been diversifying the business for a very long time now, both in terms of asset class, fund structure, distribution channel, geography. And a lot of those investments, as I highlighted in my concluding remarks are now bearing fruit and have significant momentum. Credit as well is not one thing here, right. So when you look at our credit business. It's a host of strategies, liquid and illiquid around the globe at various parts of the capital structure. And while many people feel like those businesses are maturing, if you look at the way that these funds are structured and the way that the performance is stacking, we still think that we have significant growth across the credit spectrum. It's an interesting comment on secondaries because right now, if you look at the balance sheet of all of these assets, whether it's a buyout or a piece of real estate or an infrastructure asset, everyone is dealing with the same challenge, which is fundamentally strong performance, over-levered balance sheet and a liquidity challenge. And so for the first time in a very long time when we're going through the market transition, the problem or the use case is the same in every market that we're in. It's how do you bring capital into these companies and assets in a way that minimizes dilution, expands duration and runway for the asset owner and a lot of these businesses to not just kind of get to the other side of the rate hiking cycle but to accelerate out of it. And that's taking any number of forms. It could be through direct lending, where we're making a first or second lien loan. It could come through our opportunistic credit business, where we're doing debt restructured equity investing. It could be P/E, where we're coming in with some kind of minority equity, and then it could be secondaries. So I think the investment thesis for growth in secondaries, again, secular and cyclical. Secular growth is being just driven by the growth in the primary markets on a global basis. And the cyclical opportunity is this need for creative solutions to resolve the installed base. And we are seeing volumes pick up pretty dramatically across the secondaries landscape. And I think we are uniquely positioned given the fact that we have funds in real estate, infrastructure, private equity and credit that could come into these situations at various cost of capital and be a really good solution provider. And maybe stating the obvious, just given the depth of our GP relationships in each of these markets, corporate and real assets, I think we have a really strong origination advantage. So we are working hard to continue to raise capital in that business. As we talked about, we had a very successful fundraise for our leading real estate practice. Our PMF, which is our non-traded fund, continues to scale into the opportunity. We're having very meaningful early success in growth of our credit secondaries business. So we're enthusiastic about the growth opportunity in the secondaries market and our ability to capitalize on it. And it's actually a really interesting example of an acquisition that we've made and transformed and repositioned into a new market. But I don't think it's just secondaries. Again, I think it's going to be the full product set that's going to be coming into this market to try to resolve some of these situations.\nLuke Bianculli: Sure. Understood. And appreciate all the detail. That was great. I guess, if we turn for my follow-up to credit real quick. With the outlook of perhaps a lower rate environment, at least relative to where it is today, how do you think about a potential shift in LP demand within credit? And is there a level at which lower interest rates become more of a headwind for fundraising? Or does the spread above base rates always make it an attractive asset class from an LP perspective? Thanks.\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. I think you answered your own question. I mean, our experience would be that the investor base is buying the excess return available in these markets relative to the public market equivalents. They're buying lower volatility. They're buying non-benchmark exposures. They're buying active management. But ultimately, we have not seen changes in investor demand through the different phases of this rate cycle or prior. We've been doing this a very long time, and rates go up, they go down. The balls go up, they go down, and we haven't really seen impact on investor demand. I think we're now at a point in the development of these markets while they're still growing, they are becoming core exposures in most investor portfolios, both institutional and retail. And I wouldn't expect that as rates move that we're going to see capital flowing out. One could argue maybe if rates come down that it could spur increased demand just because of our ability to continue to drive differentiated deployment, access and spread, but that's TBD.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to circle back to some of your commentary on deployment. Pace of activity continues to pick up for you guys. It's nice growth in the quarter. It sounds like the strength is continuing into the first quarter. So I was hoping you could elaborate on some of the areas of strength where you're seeing the biggest improvement in deployment? How you expect the deployment backdrop to take shape here in 2024 relative to 2023?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, Mike, it's a good question. And again, I'll just reiterate what I just said. Every part of the business is turned on right now. We have $110 billion of uninvested capital, which may sound like a lot. But if you look at our 2023 deployment, we deployed close to $70 billion of capital in what most people would argue was a tough deployment year, and that was down from a little over $80 billion in 2022. So I think we now kind of know what the guardrails are given the depth of the platform and capability set that we have. If you look at Q4 specifically, $24 billion against Q4 2022, which was about $22 billion. So we had a strong Q4 as well year prior, and I think that's a typical seasonal pattern that we see. But Q1, at least in the early goings, feels like it is going to be higher than it normally would be given seasonality. And that's causing, I think, us and others to feel optimistic about the activity going into at least the first half of the year. But it's really across the board because a lot of what we're doing in each of our businesses across credit, real assets, P/E, secondaries, like I said, is really coming into a market that is starved for capital with a big installed base of institutional equity that needs a solution. And so I wouldn't really highlight any one as jumping off the page, Mike. It's really \u2013 again, it's across the board, which is quite unique from a deployment setup standpoint because normally, when we're talking about cycles or even different outlooks for rates or the economy, one or two businesses will pop out, but that's not what we're seeing. They've all been pretty consistent year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Just a follow-up question on asset-based finance. I was hoping you could talk about the opportunity that you see in asset-backed finance, big space. Maybe just talk about more specifically where you'd like to expand, steps you're taking to add more capabilities, particularly here in 2024? And which parts of the ABF market do you see the biggest opportunity set for Ares?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. I mean I think we have probably one of the largest capabilities across the various asset classes in asset-based finance. And it's always hard to say, where the opportunity set is going to be. It's a function of what's happening in the broader market. But I think we are one of the few platforms that has dedicated in-house origination and portfolio management capability across the broad waterfront. And I think it's important that when we talk about asset-based finance and structured products that we are differentiating between the investment-grade side of the market and the non-investment-grade side of the market, meaning the bottom half of the balance sheet. And I think that we have by far the largest capital base and team against the \u2013 what I would call the non-high grade part of the market. So some of our peers have appropriately articulated, there will continue to be growth in the high-grade part of the space. We are participating in that as well. And I think there will continue to be growth in the non-investment grade part of the market. And I think we have a real leadership advantage there. Back to the earlier question just about banks and liquidity and risk transfers, we are very active on portfolio acquisitions, partnerships, risk transfers, fund finance. All of the things that are coming out of the transition in the banking market, I\u2019d say, are prominent right now, and I would expect that to continue. So maybe without getting into too much detail, I would say that, that\u2019s probably where we\u2019re seeing the biggest amount of flow as opposed to saying, which corner of the asset-based market we find most attractive because, again, that\u2019s always a function of structure, price and kind of where we are with our counterparties.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Hoping to drill in on FRPR. So it sounds like momentum, you guys feel good about the momentum in secondaries and APMF and real estate, clearly got the message that\u2019s on hold. So how should we be thinking about FRPR in credit? It seemed as though spreads tightening in the year-end. So that\u2019s probably not something we should count on. So is it possible to quantify how much of an impact that had? And then how should we be thinking about FRPR and the sensitivity to rate cuts if the forward curve plays out and we see lower policy rates?\nJarrod Phillips: Sure. Thanks for the question and morning. Overall, I think you caught on with the spreads and that, that is a component, and that certainly benefited us at the end of the year here. But it\u2019s not the main component. The main component is the interest rate aspect of it, which does \u2013 which has been a pretty big tailwind for this year. Now the advantage that we have there in terms of looking into this year is that we actually benefit on a lag because the average reset on these interest rates happens about every six months. So, we still haven\u2019t even necessarily felt the full impact of interest rate increases across the portfolio. So the same way that you think about that lag on the good, it actually happens as interest rates are declining, there\u2019s a lag till that impact occurs as well. So an interest rate reset actually doesn\u2019t have a huge impact on the overall balance. We would expect that we could be at or near similar levels if interest rates essentially were not cut significantly and rapidly and if spreads stayed essentially the same and FX rates stayed essentially the same. That would be with the same basic base balance, but we do continue to raise funds as well. And so as we raise funds within those SMAs and these perpetual capital vehicles, that does give us the opportunity to increase the amount that we can earn as well.\nMichael Arougheti: Jarrod, I would also add, as we talked about earlier, that as rates come down with that lagged effect that usually means a transaction activity is picking up and structuring and underwriting fee contribution flowing through some of those vehicles that generate FRPR would be an offset to the lagged effect of rates declining.\nBrennan Hawken: Excellent. Thank you for that color. I would like to follow up on the point around competition. So Mike, you were pretty clear in addressing why you don\u2019t think the leveraged [ph] loan market is a substantial risk. But we have seen a lot of firms raising money and moving aggressively to grow the private credit offering. So why is it that other private \u2013 how do you view the increased capital coming into the space from competitors? And what\u2019s your expectation for spreads and the potential impact on spreads from all that competition piling in?\nMichael Arougheti: I\u2019ve been pretty vocal on this, and I think that you kind of have to distill the signal through the noise in terms of the amount of capital and new entrants into private credit. So first, it\u2019s important, if you look at the growth in private credit markets over the last 10 years, it\u2019s basically grown at the same compound annual growth rate as every other market that folks participate in. It grows linearly, so it grows in a different way. But if you just look at the actual growth, it hasn\u2019t actually outpaced, it\u2019s not frothier. If you look at the structure of the private credit markets and you say that the biggest users of private credit across the private credit spectrum are institutional equity owners, there\u2019s still a significant shortfall of supply of private credit relative to the demand. So just if you use the private equity market as an example, there\u2019s about $1 trillion as I mentioned of dry powder in the private equity market today against maybe $200 billion of private credit dry powder. So you\u2019ve got 20% private credit raised against the private equity installed base. And if you said that roughly 50-50 debt to equity, you need to see a $1 trillion of private credit capital formation just to satisfy the private equity capital that\u2019s been raised. And you see similar trends emerging in infrastructure and real estate. So there\u2019s plenty of room for growth. Third, I would just highlight, and if you look at the actual numbers, the preponderance of dollars that get raised and deployed are in the hands of a few large long-tenured incumbent lenders. That has been the case. That consolidation trend is accelerating. And there are meaningful benefits to scale in private credit, the ability to originate and invest in broader origination teams around the globe, the ability to have flexible capital at scale to drive better deployment in different market environments and so on and so forth. So if you look at the number of people raising their hand that are saying we\u2019re in the private credit business, yes, that has increased. But if you look at where the dollars are flowing and the dollars already getting deployed, the competitive dynamic is not that different. And as I\u2019ve talked about earlier with regard to the syndicated loan and high-yield market, I do think that there has been some new entrants that have not been building entrenched origination networks for the last 30 years. That\u2019s the easiest place to deploy in the larger part of the market, taking advantage of challenges in the liquid market. And I do think that deployment will be tougher there than in the core middle market. But if you look at the core middle market, the competitive landscape is pretty unchanged. And you just look at the deployment numbers that we articulate for our business, if you look at our direct lending business last year, in the fourth quarter alone, we did $14 billion of deployment, which is larger than most private credit managers total AUM. So we\u2019re \u2013 I don\u2019t want to sound immodest, but we continue to execute well given all the competitive advantages we have. And I think we\u2019ll continue to do so.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Brown, KBW.\nMike Brown: Hi good afternoon. Maybe I\u2019ll start with a quick follow-up on that FRPR question. Is the answer really the same relative to your Part 1 fees in your credit business? So again, as the base rates come down, could that just be offset by greater capital markets and structuring fees? And if that is the case, is that handoff one for one in terms of timing and magnitude?\nJarrod Phillips: Yes to the first part of that question. But in terms of one for one, again, there\u2019s a bit of a lag. So you can end up with a current interest rate that\u2019s ticking a little bit higher because it hasn\u2019t reset yet against a macro backdrop that allows for more transaction activity that could actually be a tailwind in your favor. But generally, they\u2019re pretty close to one to one. They\u2019re going to interact together.\nMike Brown: Okay. Great. Thanks, Jarrod. And then on Pathfinder II, so you meaningfully surpassed your $5 billion target. You hit the hard cap there. What is the potential for this strategy long term? You\u2019re quick, back in the market to raise Pathfinder II. As you progress through the vintages, are there enough opportunities such that this could be one of your largest fund strategies overtime?\nMichael Arougheti: I would say yes, but we should just clarify that I would say fund families, right? So one of the things, again, that I think is important as you\u2019re scaling any of these private credit businesses to make sure that you have different funds for different parts of the market, whether it\u2019s different cost of capital or borrower needs or geographic nuances. So the Pathfinder family has been scaling with good performance, and I would expect will continue. But sitting next to Pathfinder II, for example, is an open-ended core fund that has a lower cost of capital and the ability to invest in a different part of the market. That is similarly scaling well with good performance. We obviously have our affiliation with Aspida that is scaling AUM within the alternative credit business. We have a number of third-party insurance SMAs and partnerships that are growing. So, I would just clarify that the alternative credit family of funds, yes, is growing nicely, continues to scale, and I think is one of the biggest growth opportunities that we have here. But you won\u2019t just see it within the core Pathfinder flagships. It\u2019s going to be the whole family of funds that surround it.\nOperator: That does conclude the Q&A portion of the call. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Arougheti for any closing remarks.\nMichael Arougheti: No, I don\u2019t think we have any. Again, we appreciate everybody\u2019s continued support and interest. And we look forward to speaking again next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our conference call for today.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jarrod Phillips",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike, and hello, everyone. Despite a difficult market backdrop for deployment and monetizations, we experienced double-digit year-over-year growth in nearly every key financial metric, including management fees, fee-related earnings, realized income, AUM and FPAUM. Our management fees increased 19% for both the fourth quarter and for the full year driven primarily by strong deployment of our invested capital, especially within our global direct lending and alternative credit strategies. In the fourth quarter, FRE totaled $369 million, an increase of 10% from the fourth quarter of 2022 despite a steep decline in FRPR from real estate funds that contributed $65 million in FRE in 2022. For the full year, FRE exceeded $1 billion for the first time in our company\u2019s history and increased 17% from the prior year. Of course, our year-over-year FRE growth was partly impacted by the fact that we did not generate any FRPR from our non-traded REITs as we expected. Our FRE, excluding the FRPR specifically from our real estate non-traded REITs, increased 25% over 2022, a little ahead of our 20%-plus guidance that we provided a year ago. Our FRE-rich earnings remain a key differentiator for Ares as FRE again accounted for more than 90% of our realized income in 2023. Our FRE margin totaled 41% for the quarter and 40.9% for the full year. Excluding FRPR, which has a lower margin due to the contractual compensation ratio we\u2019ve discussed in the past, our core FRE margin was 41.8% for the fourth quarter, which was up 120 basis points versus the comparable margin a year ago. With over $74 billion raised in 2023 and an available capital balance of over $110 billion, we expect to see continued margin expansion as we deploy our capital. We continue to believe that we\u2019re on track to reach our goal of roughly 45% core FRE run rate margin by the end of 2025. Let me turn to our fee-related performance revenues or FRPR. FRPR totaled $180 million in 2023 compared to $239 million in 2022. In the fourth quarter, FRPR from our credit group totaled $166 million, which was about $46 million above the high end of the guidance we provided on last quarter\u2019s conference call. A large part of this outperformance was driven by higher-than-expected loan pricing as a result of tighter credit spreads as well as positive currency movements into year-end. The remainder of our FRPR was generated in our secondaries group from APMF, a retail-focused product. We are excited about the momentum for APMF and could see growing contributions to FRPR as the fund scales. As I mentioned, we did not generate FRPR from our two non-traded REITs during 2023. And both AREIT and AIREIT will need to make up for negative returns in 2023 before earning any FRPR. Fundamentals across these real estate funds remain resilient, however. We will likely need to see interest rates moderate and cap rates stabilize before these funds can generate additional FRPR. For this reason alone, it is more likely that we would see FRPR from the two non-traded REITs resume in 2025 as opposed to 2024. Our realization activity increased significantly in the fourth quarter compared to Q3 with realized net performance income totaling $77 million in the quarter, including $57 million from European-style waterfall funds. For full year, nearly 70% of our realized net performance income came from European waterfall style funds. In addition, we also generated net realized performance income from incentive fees, which occur on a regular basis that are not derived from perpetual funds. In 2023, we generated $27.5 million in net realized performance income from non-European style incentive fees, up from $20 million in 2022. As I talked about before, the European-style waterfalls are relatively predictable within a given time horizon, but can vary as to the exact quarter in which they\u2019ll be received with the fourth and second quarters typically the most common for larger amounts. We\u2019re reviewing last quarter\u2019s estimate for 2024, European waterfall style net realized performance income, we recognized about $13 million that was pulled forward into this fourth quarter. That said, our expectations for the next two years are modestly higher with approximately $420 million of net performance income from European-style waterfall funds. Of this amount, we expect approximately $145 million in 2024 and $275 million or more in 2025. Over the long term, we\u2019re targeting more than $3.5 billion of net realized performance income over the life of these European-style funds already raised. As we have discussed, the timing of the early fee recognition depends on \u2013 partially on March \u2013 market transaction activity levels. In 2023, our balance of net accrued performance fees increased 10% to $919 million and nearly $700 million of this amount with an EU-style waterfall funds. The increase was largely driven by the deployment of incentive-eligible AUM that yields in excess of the hurdle rates leading to growth of our incentive-generating AUM and the compounding of higher floating rates, particularly in our private credit funds. Realized income for the fourth quarter totaled a record $434 million and for the full year, realized income exceeded $1.2 billion, a 12% increase from 2022. For the full year 2023, our effective tax rate on our realized income was 9.1%. Last year, we benefited from tax deductions related to the exercise of options by employees. These options were granted as part of the IPO and are set to expire on the 10th anniversary of our IPO this year. As a result, only a trivial amount of these options remain unexercised. And accordingly, significant related tax deductions associated with the options will not recur. Therefore, we anticipate an effective tax rate on our realized income to be in a more normalized range of 12% to 15% in 2024. As of year-end, our AUM totaled nearly $419 billion, up 19% over the previous year and was driven almost entirely by organic growth. Our fee-paying AUM totaled nearly $262 billion at year-end, an increase of 13% from year-end 2022. Our available capital totaled $111.4 billion. So we have nearly $63 billion of AUM not yet paying fees available for future deployment, representing over $621 million in incremental potential future management fees. As Mike highlighted, our portfolios continue to perform very well. For the full year, we experienced double-digit returns in our U.S., Europe and Asia direct lending strategies as well as in our special opportunity strategy. Within real assets, our infrastructure strategies performed in line with expectations, delivering a high single-digit return in volatile [ph] markets. In real estate, our returns were impacted by higher cap rates and interest rate volatility, which pressured valuation. However, the underlying property fundamentals remained resilient, and we believe we are well positioned to generate strong performance once cap rates stabilize. For example, in 2023, our industrial portfolio saw a 50% rent growth on the same-store new and renewal lease rates, and our multifamily portfolio continue to see positive rent growth. Now let me provide some comments on our go-forward outlook and our new dividend level. We anticipate that our fundraising momentum will continue with additional closes on our large fundraises and process, as Mike stated earlier, coupled with recent or expect to launch this year of four more significant fund series across our strategies. We expect these larger fundraises will be supported by our ongoing and growing inflows from smaller co-mingled funds, wealth management funds, insurance, SMAs and other open- and closed-end vehicles. In fact, we expect to have approximately 35 different funds in the market across 17 of our strategies in 2024. Although it will be unlikely that we match the amount we raised in 2023, we expect it to be another strong year. And we are already well ahead of our pace to reach our target of $500 billion in AUM by the end of 2025. Keep in mind that our fee-related earnings trajectory is more dependent on the pace of our deployment rather than fundraising activity. With a record amount of dry powder, we\u2019re well positioned for higher deployment if market activity levels remain strong. This leads me to our dividend. At the beginning of each year, we set our quarterly dividend at a fixed level for the coming year. Based on the significant outperformance of our fee-related earnings relative to our dividends and our strong growth prospects for FRE this year, we\u2019ve elected to increase our quarterly dividend to $0.93 per share on the company\u2019s Class A and non-voting common stock, a 21% increase compared to 2023. Finally, we continue to be on track with our 2021 Investor Day guidance of FRE and dividend per common share growth of 20% or more through 2025. And I\u2019m pleased to announce that on May 21, we will hold another Investor Day to coincide with the 10-year anniversary of our public listing on the New York Stock Exchange. At that time, we\u2019ll provide an update on our business goals and objectives. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Mike. Sure. And I think when we set our dividend policy out back in 2021, one of the things we articulated was that we pegged it with FRE, but didn\u2019t necessarily match it perfectly to FRE. So as FRE grows, so do we expect the dividend to grow. And for the last couple of years, as I think everyone knows, we\u2019ve had outpaced FRE growth against the dividend growth. And so certainly, that gives us a bit of a tailwind as we\u2019re determining what the dividend is. And as we look forward, and we expect a positive year of deployment, especially with what we saw in the fourth quarter and what we\u2019ve seen in terms of some of the trends so far this year, that gives us a lot of assurance in setting our FRE expectations as well as the dividend expectations for the year. And then you combine that with some of the EU waterfall guidance that we provided, and we know that we\u2019ll have adequate coverage in terms of what we generate for the year to establish that. So it\u2019s not necessarily a one for one, and we haven\u2019t historically targeted a 75% or a 90% ratio of what we would pay out for our dividend. So, we feel good at that 20% or more level. And we feel like that it is indicative of the positivity we have around FRE growth as well. Sure. Thanks for the question and morning. Overall, I think you caught on with the spreads and that, that is a component, and that certainly benefited us at the end of the year here. But it\u2019s not the main component. The main component is the interest rate aspect of it, which does \u2013 which has been a pretty big tailwind for this year. Now the advantage that we have there in terms of looking into this year is that we actually benefit on a lag because the average reset on these interest rates happens about every six months. So, we still haven\u2019t even necessarily felt the full impact of interest rate increases across the portfolio. So the same way that you think about that lag on the good, it actually happens as interest rates are declining, there\u2019s a lag till that impact occurs as well. So an interest rate reset actually doesn\u2019t have a huge impact on the overall balance. We would expect that we could be at or near similar levels if interest rates essentially were not cut significantly and rapidly and if spreads stayed essentially the same and FX rates stayed essentially the same. That would be with the same basic base balance, but we do continue to raise funds as well. And so as we raise funds within those SMAs and these perpetual capital vehicles, that does give us the opportunity to increase the amount that we can earn as well. Yes to the first part of that question. But in terms of one for one, again, there\u2019s a bit of a lag. So you can end up with a current interest rate that\u2019s ticking a little bit higher because it hasn\u2019t reset yet against a macro backdrop that allows for more transaction activity that could actually be a tailwind in your favor. But generally, they\u2019re pretty close to one to one. They\u2019re going to interact together."

            "name": "Michael Arougheti",
            "content": "Great. Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I hope everybody is doing well. We're pleased to report that we ended a great year of execution on many fronts with a very strong fourth quarter. Despite a difficult year for fundraising across our industry, we experienced strong demand for our funds, raising more than $74 billion in 2023, including more than $21 billion in the fourth quarter. This was our second largest fundraising year, and it was a record amount of capital raised directly from institutional investors. We entered 2024 in the enviable position of having more than $110 billion in dry powder to invest in what we believe is an attractive vintage, providing the opportunity to drive strong earnings growth in the years ahead.  In the fourth quarter, transaction activity picked up as market participants gained greater certainty with respect to interest rates and the economy. Against this backdrop, we were able to leverage our growing investment platform to record our strongest quarter of deployment for the year, which matched our second highest quarter on record. Our Q4 deployment jumped more than 40% compared to our third quarter, and we're encouraged that higher-than-typical levels of activity for this time of year have spilled over into the first quarter. We also continued to deliver strong relative investment performance for the year. And in fact, our U.S., Europe and Asia direct lending strategies generated double-digit returns in 2023. We believe that our consistent performance through cycles is resonating with investors, and our LPs are committing additional dollars across our broad set of strategies. For the year, we drove double-digit growth across many of our key financial metrics, including 19% growth in AUM and management fees and 17% growth in our fee-related earnings. I'd add that our fee-related earnings, excluding FRPR, increased by more than 20% year-over-year. We believe that our ability to generate this level of fee-related earnings growth in a market where M&A activity was down over 35% speaks to the resiliency of our management fee-centric business. Going forward, we believe that we are headed for another strong year as Jarrod will walk you through a little later in the call, but I do want to highlight a few key points. First, we believe that the expectation for lower interest rates and better-than-expected economic growth is viewed as a significant relief for the deal markets. And we expect it will help drive higher transaction activity to start the year. We also believe that other factors like the aging of private equity dry powder and the demands by LPs to return capital are also supportive of higher activity. Fortunately for us, we believe that we're well positioned for a pickup in deployment activity due to the significant investments that we've made, adding 230 net investment professionals since the peak in market activity in 2021. We've built an origination engine that's capable of doing much more and an increase in market activity should enable us to drive efficiencies across our greater headcount of investment professionals. Secondly, we believe that we're approaching a step function in the growth of our net realized performance income. We're nearing an inflection point and a recognition of net realized performance income from our European waterfall funds that have been performing and growing since 2017. And therefore, we expect to ramp up this year and an acceleration in 2025 and beyond. As an added benefit, if market transaction activity does in fact improve, we could see more of this income pulled forward from realizations, but it's still too early to make that call. Overall, we believe our business is well positioned to operate in a variety of market environments. We're resilient in tougher, slower markets but can see deployment and realizations accelerate during more active market environments. Third, we have a lot of momentum with our investors as we experience strong demand for not only our private credit strategies but also our opportunistic real estate, real estate debt and our secondary strategy offerings. In 2024, we believe that we're set up for yet another strong year of fundraising as some of our largest fundraises spilled over into the new year, and we're launching several new large funds with expected closings this year. Let me walk you through some recent activities to provide insights on where we stand heading into the new year. For the fourth quarter, the $21.1 billion we raised was our third highest quarter on record and just slightly behind what we raised in Q3. In our credit strategies, we continue to make great progress, raising our third U.S. senior direct lending fund with another $1.8 billion in new equity commitments in Q4, bringing the total equity commitments to $8.3 billion at year-end with total investment capacity of $15.2 billion, including anticipated leverage. We've already surpassed the $8 billion in LP commitments from our previous vintage, and we anticipate a final close in the second quarter with the ability to add further leverage capacity thereafter. Our sixth European direct lending fund raised another \u20ac1.3 billion in equity commitments and a \u20ac2.5 billion leverage facility during the fourth quarter. With over \u20ac550 million closed thus far in the first quarter, our equity commitments for this new fund now total \u20ac11 billion. And with anticipated leverage, the fund has over \u20ac16 billion of investable capital. We've essentially matched the size of the previous vintage, and we expect further upside into a final close later in 2024. Pathfinder II held a final close in October, only seven months after its first close. The fund received $6.6 billion in total commitments, surpassing our $5 billion target. The fund hit its hard cap and was almost 80% larger than its predecessor fund. And as with its predecessor fund, Pathfinder II is structured with a unique charitable tie-in whereby at least 10% of the carried interest will be donated by Ares and the team to support global health and education initiatives. To date, the Ares Pathfinder family funds have generated returns that would result in approximately $19 million of charitable contributions. We raised another $900 million in equity commitments for our fourth U.S. opportunistic real estate equity fund bringing total commitments to over $2 billion, exceeding the previous vintage. Within real estate, we also raised another $500 million in debt and equity commitments in our European real estate debt strategy, bringing total assets to approximately $2.4 billion. Within private equity, we raised $1.4 billion of commitments during Q4, and we\u2019ll continue our fundraising throughout most of 2024. In secondaries, we held a final close for our Real Estate Fund IX, raising $3.3 billion in commitments, inclusive of affiliated co-invest vehicles. This latest fundraise matched the size of the predecessor fund, which was the largest real estate secondaries fund closed in the market to date. We now have completed the top two largest real estate secondaries fundraisers, which puts us in a great market position. Fundraising in the wealth management sector continues to be an area of focus, and we see significant growth potential here over the next decade. We\u2019re starting to see an acceleration within the wealth management channel as our broadening set of products is attracting a growing number of distribution partners. For the fourth quarter, we raised $1.3 billion in equity commitments. For the full year, we raised $3.6 billion in equity commitments and nearly $5 billion, including debt commitments. According to third-party industry data, we were ranked in the top three among the public alternative managers and overall wealth management fundraising in 2023 as we were able to gain market share in a difficult environment. Our strong momentum in the fourth quarter has carried over into January as we had our largest month ever for wealth inflows, totaling over $600 million across our six products. Now after putting in place the infrastructure over the past 18 months, we\u2019re also set to see our international fundraising efforts materially increase in the first half of this year. Let me walk through an update on a few of these wealth products. Our non-traded BDC ASIF raised nearly $500 million in equity commitments during the fourth quarter. And our European equivalent ASIF raised over $150 million closing on January 2. During January, these two funds raised an additional $350 million in the aggregate, which underpins our expectation for continued strong fundraising in the wealth channel during 2024. Within private equity, we\u2019re now seeing a significant ramp in our Ares Private Markets Fund or APMF, which launched on its first wire house in September and raised roughly $240 million in the fourth quarter. And with over $800 million in assets today, the fund is continuing to gain scale and momentum. Our two non-traded REITs raised $273 million combined in the fourth quarter and more than $1.3 billion for the full year. Both funds continued to generate positive net flows for both Q4 and the full year as we meaningfully outperformed the overall non-traded REIT market on a net flow basis. Another area of high strategic focus is our affiliated insurance business. Aspida finished the year with nearly $12.5 billion in assets, more than doubling its $6 billion in AUM at the beginning of last year. And we remain on track with our target of $25 billion in AUM by the end of 2025. Aspida has now achieved operational scale and is generating attractive returns for both annuity holders and Aspida equity investors. We had very strong deployment in the fourth quarter totaling $24 billion, matching our second highest quarter on record. Fourth quarter deployment across the credit group increased nearly 60% over the third quarter driven by strong results from our U.S. and European direct lending and alternative credit groups. Jarrod will discuss our fund performance in more detail, but our investment portfolios continue to be in excellent shape. We continue to see strong EBITDA growth across our credit and private equity portfolios. And in fact, we saw an acceleration of EBITDA growth to approximately 8% year-over-year within our U.S. direct lending segment. Our corporate credit portfolios, which were more than 95% invested in senior debt at the end of the year, continue to have low defaults and lower-than-historical levels of loan-to-value. Our global real estate portfolio continues to experience resilient fundamentals due to our allocation to the best performing sectors with 50% of the gross portfolio in industrial assets, 24% in multifamily and another 13% in similar adjacent sectors like student housing and self-storage. We\u2019re meaningfully underweight in U.S. office at about 4% of our total real estate portfolio and less than 1% of our AUM. Our opportunistic real estate and special opportunities teams recently formed a joint venture with a leading owner and investor in commercial real estate in New York. The JV has commitments of $500 million, and we\u2019ll seek to invest in high-quality distressed office buildings in New York as capital for the asset class has become increasingly scarce. And now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jarrod for additional commentary on our financial results and our outlook for the year. Jarrod? Great. Thanks, Jarrod. In closing, we believe that we\u2019re very well positioned for the year ahead with a record amount of dry powder, a more promising market outlook, an expanded and more diversified investment platform and a strongly performing portfolio. The investments that we\u2019ve made in new personnel, new strategies, new vehicles and new distribution across the platform over the past few years beginning to contribute more meaningfully to our business. For example, we\u2019re seeing momentum in our insurance, wealth management, infrastructure, secondaries and Ares Asia platforms. Our fund performance also continues to be a source of differentiation, and our brand is strengthening with our investors and prospective portfolio companies. Collectively, our business is positioned to deliver strong relative returns for our fund investors, drive further growth in assets under management and create better operational efficiencies in the years to come. And as Jarrod mentioned, when you combine our strong FRE growth prospects with the inflection point that we\u2019re now reaching with our European waterfall realizations, we\u2019re poised to generate meaningful realized income in the years ahead. I continue to believe that one of our greatest differentiators is our people and our culture. And as always, I\u2019m so proud and grateful for the hard work and dedication of our employees across the globe. I\u2019m also deeply appreciative of our investors\u2019 continuing support for our company. And with that, operator, I think we could now open the line for questions. Yes, it\u2019s a good question. We\u2019ve talked about this before. Obviously, we were early, I think, in identifying the growing opportunity in alternative credit. I think it\u2019s important that people appreciate like so many things happening in private credit right now with both secular and cyclical. So a lot of the secular trends that have been driving more capital formation in Alt Credit actually started post the GSE with the dismantling of the larger securitization apparatus on the street and the proliferation of smaller finance companies in the wake of the GSE. And that trend, call it, the first wave has been very much intact for the last 10 years and has given us a nice backdrop to grow what we think is a market-leading business there. Obviously, now with Basel III and some of the challenges that I think we all saw emerge in the banking sector generally early last year, there is an accelerated cyclical opportunity, obviously, to partner with banks largely in our Alt Credit business to help them navigate some of their balance sheet challenges. And that\u2019s been a keen area of focus, but not an exclusive area of focus. We talked on our last call about a sizable partnership transaction that we did with PacWest. We were public about a recent trade that we did on the risk transfer side. And those dialogues are ongoing and continuing. And I actually think that they will continue regardless of the resolution of Basel III end game. I think what we learned coming out of the struggles in the sector were largely structural. And once we get past this first phase of balance sheet restructuring and repositioning, I think you\u2019re going to have a lot of banks, regional, super regional and GSIBs just rethinking core businesses and balance sheet positioning. And we put ourselves out there as a proven partner for them as they go through that. So, I think it\u2019s \u2013 it bodes well for continued deployment. And we had a very strong fourth quarter in Alt Credit. We\u2019re seeing that activity level spill over into the New Year, and I\u2019d expect that to continue. Morning. Sure. Good question. Just to clarify, Craig, the $350 million was both ASIF and its European counterpart, but obviously, strong numbers relative to the momentum that we saw building into the end of the year. I do think that both ASIF and AESIF are benefiting from our long successful track record at scale in the public markets. Obviously, as the market leader in direct lending and having run BDCs through cycles, I think that, that is definitely a tailwind. And I think if you look at the early fundraising momentum that we\u2019re enjoying both of those funds that compares well to competitor product. One of the reasons that we are so excited right now, both of those products are actually only on one platform. We had our first wealth closing in ASIF in August, and we actually now are expecting to add a significant number of new partners throughout the year, both in the U.S. and overseas, Europe and Asia. So I think you\u2019ll see that selling group increase dramatically as we get through the rest of the year. And needless to say that, that should result in some pretty good fundraising momentum. Similarly, on AESIF, we have one partner, and our expectation is that we\u2019ll probably add two or three there as well in Q2 or Q3 of this year. Yes, it\u2019s interesting. I think \u2013 and we said this in the prepared remarks, we\u2019re quite pleased with our performance relative to the rest of the non-traded REIT product in 2023, which was a difficult year just given performance headwinds and some of the redemption conversation around some of our larger peers. But if you look at the performance of both of the REITs, we actually had positive flows in the quarter and throughout the year, which I think is an outlier. I think that\u2019s a combination of the positioning of those funds. There are some unique attributes in terms of our 1031 Exchange product that I think is a little stickier. Those funds are less leveraged. So, we\u2019re going into 2024, obviously, having seen reduced sales but having positive net flows in both of those products. And my expectation would be that as some of the peer performance improves and people begin to feel like we\u2019re hitting bottom on cap rates and interest rates that you\u2019ll begin to see sales pick up there. So again, it\u2019s still early. Our experience in January would tell us that the sales are still there. But I think once we get to a place where interest rates are moderating and the redemption narrative within the peer set has moderated that we\u2019ll see ourselves accelerate as well. Sure. I want to clarify some of the comments that were made on the ARCC call, because that is not how I would interpret the commentary. There is a give and take in the market generally that when the markets are accelerating in activity, the banks will get more active, syndicated loan and high-yield market will open up and the CLO machine will turn on. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing because that means that transaction activity is picking up, and there\u2019s an opportunity to drive higher volumes and higher fees. I think it\u2019s important that people appreciate at least from the Ares [ph] and ARCC perceive is that we continue to have a very, very strong focus on the traditional middle market. It\u2019s a very big part of what we do across the globe. And I think there\u2019s a little bit of a misunderstanding that a lot of the growth has come from share gains from the syndicated loan and high-yield market. And as long as we\u2019ve been doing this, yes, there are moments in time when the loan market is closed. And at the higher end of the middle market, private credit providers can take share and then obviously, when the markets heal, activity levels pick up. But unlike some of our larger peers, we are not dependent on a transfer of market share from the liquid markets in order to continue to drive the growth and performance that we\u2019ve seen. So to clarify, I think, the commentary, I would say the enhanced levels of activity and turning back on of the deal market writ large, I think, right now is significantly more of a positive than a negative. There are significant, what I would call mitigants to refinancing in the private markets unlike the liquid markets that tend to just be price-driven. A lot of that is just relationships. So if you look at our deployment, for example, in 2023, 57% of our deployment in 2023 was to incumbent borrowers. That relationship is critically important and is actually protective of the portfolio. And then when you look at the amount of upfront fees, call protection, et cetera, that exist in these private credit instruments, even as spreads are tightening and capital is flowing into the liquid market, the economics of refinancing take a while to find their way into the market. So, I think as we\u2019re sitting here today, I would say it\u2019s actually a net positive. We\u2019re seeing increased transaction activity, more liquidity in the market. And I think that\u2019s generally a good thing. So, I heard some of the commentary on the call yesterday. I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re looking at a return to normal in the liquid markets is bad for the Ares Credit business. I\u2019d also highlight that we are one of the largest liquid credit managers and CLO managers as well. So from the Ares management perspective, as that market opens up, we\u2019re a big beneficiary as well. Yes. It is remarkably similar. If you look at the EBITDA numbers that were quoted for the ARCC portfolio is about an 8% year-over-year EBITDA growth that had accelerated from 6% in the prior quarter. If you look at the European direct funding, which is actually pretty amazing, year-over-year EBITDA growth was 18%. LTVs are a little bit higher. They\u2019re kind of in the 48% range in Europe versus 42%, 43% in Europe. Interest coverage is a little bit higher in Europe, 1.8% versus 1.6%. But if you just take all of the different ways to articulate credit exposure, they're largely similar. But we're seeing a surprising amount of momentum and resilience within the fundamental revenue and EBITDA portfolio in Europe right now. It's a good question. I think Kipp articulated it well, which is just by definition, given the rate backdrop and the assumption that rates will stay higher for longer, I think you will see an uptick in defaults, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. And what we keep trying to focus people on is the structural improvement in the leverage lending market, particularly the private credit market in terms of the amount of equity subordination in a lot of these capital structures. And so if you look at loans to value of 42% or 48%, when you look at the structure of the private equity market, there's about $3.5 trillion of private equity sitting at the bottom of a lot of these capital structures with $1 trillion of dry powder to protect value. And so I think part of what you are seeing is that even if there's a nonaccrual, many of these are unlike prior cycles where you have fundamental underperformance at the company level. They're being driven by higher rates for some of the better performing companies that were able to access more leverage. And those are a lot easier to resolve, both in terms of modification and amendment. But they're also the first places that capital coming in from the private equity sponsors to protect the value below you. I would say the industry is obviously running higher than we are. I think that we continue to outperform from a credit standpoint. But we're at peak rates. The economy continues to be strong. So if rates stay at this level, I would expect that to tick up a little bit, but I don't think that we're going to return to historical levels. Sure. Obviously, we have been diversifying the business for a very long time now, both in terms of asset class, fund structure, distribution channel, geography. And a lot of those investments, as I highlighted in my concluding remarks are now bearing fruit and have significant momentum. Credit as well is not one thing here, right. So when you look at our credit business. It's a host of strategies, liquid and illiquid around the globe at various parts of the capital structure. And while many people feel like those businesses are maturing, if you look at the way that these funds are structured and the way that the performance is stacking, we still think that we have significant growth across the credit spectrum. It's an interesting comment on secondaries because right now, if you look at the balance sheet of all of these assets, whether it's a buyout or a piece of real estate or an infrastructure asset, everyone is dealing with the same challenge, which is fundamentally strong performance, over-levered balance sheet and a liquidity challenge. And so for the first time in a very long time when we're going through the market transition, the problem or the use case is the same in every market that we're in. It's how do you bring capital into these companies and assets in a way that minimizes dilution, expands duration and runway for the asset owner and a lot of these businesses to not just kind of get to the other side of the rate hiking cycle but to accelerate out of it. And that's taking any number of forms. It could be through direct lending, where we're making a first or second lien loan. It could come through our opportunistic credit business, where we're doing debt restructured equity investing. It could be P/E, where we're coming in with some kind of minority equity, and then it could be secondaries. So I think the investment thesis for growth in secondaries, again, secular and cyclical. Secular growth is being just driven by the growth in the primary markets on a global basis. And the cyclical opportunity is this need for creative solutions to resolve the installed base. And we are seeing volumes pick up pretty dramatically across the secondaries landscape. And I think we are uniquely positioned given the fact that we have funds in real estate, infrastructure, private equity and credit that could come into these situations at various cost of capital and be a really good solution provider. And maybe stating the obvious, just given the depth of our GP relationships in each of these markets, corporate and real assets, I think we have a really strong origination advantage. So we are working hard to continue to raise capital in that business. As we talked about, we had a very successful fundraise for our leading real estate practice. Our PMF, which is our non-traded fund, continues to scale into the opportunity. We're having very meaningful early success in growth of our credit secondaries business. So we're enthusiastic about the growth opportunity in the secondaries market and our ability to capitalize on it. And it's actually a really interesting example of an acquisition that we've made and transformed and repositioned into a new market. But I don't think it's just secondaries. Again, I think it's going to be the full product set that's going to be coming into this market to try to resolve some of these situations. Yes. I think you answered your own question. I mean, our experience would be that the investor base is buying the excess return available in these markets relative to the public market equivalents. They're buying lower volatility. They're buying non-benchmark exposures. They're buying active management. But ultimately, we have not seen changes in investor demand through the different phases of this rate cycle or prior. We've been doing this a very long time, and rates go up, they go down. The balls go up, they go down, and we haven't really seen impact on investor demand. I think we're now at a point in the development of these markets while they're still growing, they are becoming core exposures in most investor portfolios, both institutional and retail. And I wouldn't expect that as rates move that we're going to see capital flowing out. One could argue maybe if rates come down that it could spur increased demand just because of our ability to continue to drive differentiated deployment, access and spread, but that's TBD. Yes, Mike, it's a good question. And again, I'll just reiterate what I just said. Every part of the business is turned on right now. We have $110 billion of uninvested capital, which may sound like a lot. But if you look at our 2023 deployment, we deployed close to $70 billion of capital in what most people would argue was a tough deployment year, and that was down from a little over $80 billion in 2022. So I think we now kind of know what the guardrails are given the depth of the platform and capability set that we have. If you look at Q4 specifically, $24 billion against Q4 2022, which was about $22 billion. So we had a strong Q4 as well year prior, and I think that's a typical seasonal pattern that we see. But Q1, at least in the early goings, feels like it is going to be higher than it normally would be given seasonality. And that's causing, I think, us and others to feel optimistic about the activity going into at least the first half of the year. But it's really across the board because a lot of what we're doing in each of our businesses across credit, real assets, P/E, secondaries, like I said, is really coming into a market that is starved for capital with a big installed base of institutional equity that needs a solution. And so I wouldn't really highlight any one as jumping off the page, Mike. It's really \u2013 again, it's across the board, which is quite unique from a deployment setup standpoint because normally, when we're talking about cycles or even different outlooks for rates or the economy, one or two businesses will pop out, but that's not what we're seeing. They've all been pretty consistent year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. Yes. I mean I think we have probably one of the largest capabilities across the various asset classes in asset-based finance. And it's always hard to say, where the opportunity set is going to be. It's a function of what's happening in the broader market. But I think we are one of the few platforms that has dedicated in-house origination and portfolio management capability across the broad waterfront. And I think it's important that when we talk about asset-based finance and structured products that we are differentiating between the investment-grade side of the market and the non-investment-grade side of the market, meaning the bottom half of the balance sheet. And I think that we have by far the largest capital base and team against the \u2013 what I would call the non-high grade part of the market. So some of our peers have appropriately articulated, there will continue to be growth in the high-grade part of the space. We are participating in that as well. And I think there will continue to be growth in the non-investment grade part of the market. And I think we have a real leadership advantage there. Back to the earlier question just about banks and liquidity and risk transfers, we are very active on portfolio acquisitions, partnerships, risk transfers, fund finance. All of the things that are coming out of the transition in the banking market, I\u2019d say, are prominent right now, and I would expect that to continue. So maybe without getting into too much detail, I would say that, that\u2019s probably where we\u2019re seeing the biggest amount of flow as opposed to saying, which corner of the asset-based market we find most attractive because, again, that\u2019s always a function of structure, price and kind of where we are with our counterparties. Jarrod, I would also add, as we talked about earlier, that as rates come down with that lagged effect that usually means a transaction activity is picking up and structuring and underwriting fee contribution flowing through some of those vehicles that generate FRPR would be an offset to the lagged effect of rates declining. I\u2019ve been pretty vocal on this, and I think that you kind of have to distill the signal through the noise in terms of the amount of capital and new entrants into private credit. So first, it\u2019s important, if you look at the growth in private credit markets over the last 10 years, it\u2019s basically grown at the same compound annual growth rate as every other market that folks participate in. It grows linearly, so it grows in a different way. But if you just look at the actual growth, it hasn\u2019t actually outpaced, it\u2019s not frothier. If you look at the structure of the private credit markets and you say that the biggest users of private credit across the private credit spectrum are institutional equity owners, there\u2019s still a significant shortfall of supply of private credit relative to the demand. So just if you use the private equity market as an example, there\u2019s about $1 trillion as I mentioned of dry powder in the private equity market today against maybe $200 billion of private credit dry powder. So you\u2019ve got 20% private credit raised against the private equity installed base. And if you said that roughly 50-50 debt to equity, you need to see a $1 trillion of private credit capital formation just to satisfy the private equity capital that\u2019s been raised. And you see similar trends emerging in infrastructure and real estate. So there\u2019s plenty of room for growth. Third, I would just highlight, and if you look at the actual numbers, the preponderance of dollars that get raised and deployed are in the hands of a few large long-tenured incumbent lenders. That has been the case. That consolidation trend is accelerating. And there are meaningful benefits to scale in private credit, the ability to originate and invest in broader origination teams around the globe, the ability to have flexible capital at scale to drive better deployment in different market environments and so on and so forth. So if you look at the number of people raising their hand that are saying we\u2019re in the private credit business, yes, that has increased. But if you look at where the dollars are flowing and the dollars already getting deployed, the competitive dynamic is not that different. And as I\u2019ve talked about earlier with regard to the syndicated loan and high-yield market, I do think that there has been some new entrants that have not been building entrenched origination networks for the last 30 years. That\u2019s the easiest place to deploy in the larger part of the market, taking advantage of challenges in the liquid market. And I do think that deployment will be tougher there than in the core middle market. But if you look at the core middle market, the competitive landscape is pretty unchanged. And you just look at the deployment numbers that we articulate for our business, if you look at our direct lending business last year, in the fourth quarter alone, we did $14 billion of deployment, which is larger than most private credit managers total AUM. So we\u2019re \u2013 I don\u2019t want to sound immodest, but we continue to execute well given all the competitive advantages we have. And I think we\u2019ll continue to do so. I would say yes, but we should just clarify that I would say fund families, right? So one of the things, again, that I think is important as you\u2019re scaling any of these private credit businesses to make sure that you have different funds for different parts of the market, whether it\u2019s different cost of capital or borrower needs or geographic nuances. So the Pathfinder family has been scaling with good performance, and I would expect will continue. But sitting next to Pathfinder II, for example, is an open-ended core fund that has a lower cost of capital and the ability to invest in a different part of the market. That is similarly scaling well with good performance. We obviously have our affiliation with Aspida that is scaling AUM within the alternative credit business. We have a number of third-party insurance SMAs and partnerships that are growing. So, I would just clarify that the alternative credit family of funds, yes, is growing nicely, continues to scale, and I think is one of the biggest growth opportunities that we have here. But you won\u2019t just see it within the core Pathfinder flagships. It\u2019s going to be the whole family of funds that surround it. No, I don\u2019t think we have any. Again, we appreciate everybody\u2019s continued support and interest. And we look forward to speaking again next quarter. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to Ares Management Corporation's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Tuesday, October 31st, 2023. I will now turn the call over to Carl Drake, Head of Public Market Investor Relations for Ares Management.\nCarl Drake: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for our third quarter conference call. I'm joined today by Michael Arougheti, our Chief Executive Officer; and Jarrod Phillips, our Chief Financial Officer. We also have a number of senior professionals with us today who will be available during the Q&A session. Before we begin, I want to remind you that comments made during this call contain forward-looking statements and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those identified in our risk factors in our SEC filings. Our actual results could differ materially, and we undertake no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Please also note that past performance is not a guarantee of future results and nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Ares Fund. During this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures which should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Please refer to our third quarter earnings presentation available on the Investor Resources section of our website for reconciliations of the measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Note that we plan to file our Form 10-Q in the first week of November. This morning, we announced that we declared our fourth quarter common dividend of $0.77 per share in the company's Class A and non-voting common stock, representing an increase of 26% over our dividend for the same quarter a year ago. The dividend will be paid on December 29th, 2023, to holders of record on December 15th. Of note, we plan to update investors about our new quarterly dividends for 2024 during our fourth quarter earnings call early next year. Now, I will turn the call over to Michael Arougheti.\nMichael Arougheti: Thank you, Carl and good morning. Before we begin, I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge the horrific terrorist attacks that occurred in Israel and the subsequent loss of lives. Our hearts go out to all the innocent people and for the pain and suffering on both sides throughout the region. We are all holding on to hope for a peaceful resolution. Now, I'd like to begin with some market commentary and quarterly business and strategic highlights. During the third quarter, the markets adjusted to the expectation for rates to stay higher for longer while the underlying economy remained resilient, with robust GDP, a strong labor market, and continued modest growth in corporate profits. We're seeing the lag effects from higher rates and the slow and uneven economic growth play out across the global markets that we invest in. Transaction activity remains slower than usual due to the higher cost of capital and valuation disparities among buyers and sellers yet there's significant pent-up demand and a large amount of aging private equity dry powder available to be invested. We're seeing our private pipeline build generally with higher quality assets and strong growth characteristics coming to market. We're also seeing a growing need for creative liquidity solutions, recapitalizations and rescue financings, and more interest in secondaries. With this economic backdrop, it remains a compelling time to invest across private market assets with defensive characteristics, particularly within private credit, as we see risk/reward characteristics that are as favorable as we've seen in many years. Our quarterly results continue to demonstrate our strong growth and resiliency in these slower and more challenging market environments. We raised $21.9 billion in new commitments in the quarter, our second highest fundraising quarter in the history of our firm, and we've now raised $53.4 billion through the end of the third quarter. We continue to benefit from our existing institutional investors who re-up or cross over into new Ares Fund products, along with new investors who recognize our consistent fund performance and leadership in managing private assets. We also saw an increase in flows from our wealth management channel, supported by our newly launched non-traded BDC. Fund [ph] performance across our primary investment strategies also continues to be a highlight as approximately three quarters of those strategies performed well compared to their respective relative public indices or exceeded their annualized target returns in the third quarter. We also incrementally increased our third quarter deployment, which supported growth in our management fees and fee-related earnings. For the first nine months, our management fees and fee-related earnings each grew by 20% or better compared to the same period last year. Now let me provide an update on our three private credit funds, which are all on track or have already closed at levels in excess of prior vintages. In the third quarter, we held the first close for our third US senior direct lending fund of nearly $6.5 billion in equity commitments plus nearly $2 billion in committed fund leverage. The first closing of LP commitments for this fund exceeded 80% of the total equity commitments for the predecessor fund. With additional closes expected into the first half of next year, we expect to meaningfully exceed the prior fund size of $8 billion in equity commitments and $15 billion in total investable capital. Overall, our US direct lending business raised $11.6 billion in the third quarter which brought our total AUM in this strategy to nearly $118 billion. As a market leader, we believe that our global direct lending business continues to have significant white space as the private credit markets are meaningfully undersized compared to the $5 trillion of private equity AUM. We also raised an additional \u20ac750 million for our sixth European direct lending fund in the third quarter and almost \u20ac800 million more in October, bringing total commitments to \u20ac9.9 billion to date. We have line of sight to over \u20ac11 billion of equity commitments by year-end which would equal or exceed our prior fund vintage. We expect to surpass our prior vintage with additional closings from investors in our pipeline by early in the second quarter of 2024. With over 85 investment professionals located in six offices across Europe, we believe that we have the largest and most tenured direct lending franchise on the continent, managing over $60 billion of AUM. With our leading alternative credit strategy, Pathfinder II closed approximately $2.2 billion in the third quarter, bringing total commitments to $5.8 billion at quarter end. And as we publicly announced yesterday, Pathfinder II held its final close at its hard cap of $6.6 billion, nearly double the size of the predecessor fund. We experienced significant investor demand hitting our hard cap in only seven months since the first closing. In addition to Pathfinder II, our open-end core alternative credit fund raised $750 million in the quarter, bringing total commitments to over $4.2 billion. The strong investor demand for alternative credit strategies is driven in part by filling the gaps created by a pullback from traditional providers, along with the structural changes that we're witnessing in the banking industry. With more than $32 billion in AUM, our alternative credit business is a leader in the private, non-rated and illiquid segment of the asset-backed market and is poised for growth in what we believe is at least a $4 trillion global addressable market. In Asia credit, we raised nearly $400 million in the quarter, including an approximate $200 million final close in Ares SSG Capital Partners VI, bringing final commitments to $2.4 billion, including a Sidecar fund. We're seeing strong economic trends and robust corporate earnings growth in India and Australia, which account for 60% of our investments across the region, and we're seeing a growing opportunity set for financing solutions for sponsor-led acquisitions in these markets. Within Real Assets, we raised more than $500 million in a European real estate debt mandate, which now totals over $1 billion, and we anticipate that this strategy will continue to grow. Our real estate debt business now exceeds $11 billion, and we believe the team is well positioned for further growth due to investor demand and the current acute need for capital in the industry. Our second climate infrastructure fund raised another $200 million in the quarter, plus an additional $300 million in October, and this completed the funds closed with total equity commitments of nearly $1.1 billion or approximately 80% of the total equity commitments in the prior fund vintage. We currently have over 30 funds in the market, and by year-end, we expect to have first closes in our seventh corporate private equity fund, our inaugural credit secondaries fund and our third infrastructure secondaries fund, as well as additional closings in our larger funds, such as our fourth US opportunistic real estate equity fund, our second climate infrastructure fund and our sixth European Direct Lending fund, as just discussed. Through the end of October, we have now raised nearly $58 billion, and we expect total fundraising for the year to exceed $65 billion, well ahead of the $57 billion we raised last year. Throughout next year, we have several of our largest fund series expected to hold first closings for successor funds, including our six infrastructure debt fund, our third special opportunities fund and our third US junior direct lending fund. While our core fundraising continues to be supported by expanding within the global institutional market, our strategically important insurance and wealth management channels are also poised for growth. Our affiliated insurance business, Aspida, continued its organic growth with new assets of more than $1 billion, bringing total AUM to $10.6 billion by quarter end. We believe investors are attracted not only to Ares' credit investing expertise, but also the technological advantages that Aspida is bringing to the annuity market. Our growth outlook is promising as we're seeing demand for new annuities, reinsurance flow and opportunities for block trades, which we would expect to fund largely with third-party capital. We believe that we are on track to meet or exceed our goal of reaching $25 billion or more in AUM by the end of 2025. Within Wealth Management, our ongoing objective is to market a limited number of core semi-liquid institutional quality products through our global wealth management channel. We're well on our way to accomplishing this over the next several years and today, we're one of the largest alternative managers in the wealth industry with over 120 professionals, a footprint across North America, Europe and Asia, six products and relationships with nearly every major warehouse and private bank. We expect to continue adding strategic partnerships and gain market share as we scale each one of these products. After launching our non-traded BDC, ASIF, primarily on one wire house in June, that has seen steady momentum with approximately $550 million raised in the first three months, including the September flows, which closed on October 1, bringing total AUM to over $2.7 billion. There are four additional global platforms that we expect will add ASIF in the first half of 2024. And despite a tough market for real estate fundraising, we continue to see net aggregate flows collectively across our two non-traded REITs, including the 1031 exchange programs. Turning to deployment. We invested $16.7 billion in the third quarter, which was up from the $15.2 billion in the second quarter, but down from $18.3 billion in the third quarter of 2022. We're beginning to see signs of large deal activity returning as Q3 was the third highest quarter for $1 billion plug tranche deals financed by the private credit markets. While still early and markets remain slower than we'd like, we're encouraged by our fourth quarter-to-date investment activity and our pipeline. For 2024, we currently expect market activity to improve due to the aging private equity dry powder that is approaching the end of its investment period, growing pressure from LPs to return capital, stronger sentiment among middle market companies and further pressure on balance sheets and capital structures as rates stay higher for longer. We're also seeing a growing opportunity to partner with the banking sector through our alternative credit business. The bank market continues to be impacted by regulatory changes, asset liability mismatches and an inverted yield curve, all of which changed the way banks participate in certain segments of the market. Over the years, we've developed extensive bank partnerships where we have the opportunity to provide solutions to augment their existing businesses to improve risk weightings and reduce capital charges, while at the same time generate attractive returns for our investors. Our alternative credit team believes that we're in the early innings of these types of transactions and we're seeing an increase in our collaboration with our banking partners. Finally, we continue to explore inorganic growth opportunities to expand our business through both product and geographic expansion. In October, we closed on the acquisition of Crescent Point, a leading Asia-focused private equity firm with $3.7 billion in assets under management. The Asia Pacific region is a key geographic target for us and we continue to look at various ways to expand each of our business lines into that region, either through organic team builds or strategic acquisitions. And as you may have seen, we also recently closed a strategic partnership and investment in Vinci Partners, a leading alternative asset manager in Latin America. We've known the Vinci team for over a decade and are excited to collaborate on distribution, product development and other business opportunities in Brazil and across Latin America. We believe that the Latin American markets are in the very early stages of shifting capital into the private markets, particularly within private credit. This is similar to the trends that we saw in the early 2000s in Europe, and what we're seeing now beginning to play out in the APAC region. We'll continue to look for unique and attractive global growth opportunities for our business. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jarrod for comments on our financial results. Jarrod?\nJarrod Phillips: Thanks Mike. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. In the third quarter, we continue to see strong growth in our management fees, fee-related earnings, AUM and fee paying AUM compared to the third quarter of 2022. While realizations were light in the third quarter as we expected, we have a clear line of sight on stronger fourth quarter realizations, due to our European-style waterfall funds. We're also on track to recognize a meaningful year-over-year increase in FRPR from our credit funds, as I will discuss. Starting with AUM. We ended the third quarter with $395 billion of AUM and we're tracking well to meet or exceed our target of $500 million or more by the end of 2025. Our FPAUM grew to over $247 billion, up from over $218 billion this time last year, driven by deployment across our credit and special opportunities funds and new commitments to funds in our Real Assets group. For the first time in our firm's history, we have over $100 billion in dry powder, of which over $65 billion is AUM not yet paying fees and available for future deployment. Upon deployment, this would generate nearly $650 million in incremental management fees and position us for continued FRE growth and margin efficiencies. From a revenue perspective, our management fees totaled over $643 million in the quarter, an increase of 17% compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by deployment of our available capital in our credit group. Other fee income of approximately $20 million was down from the prior period as there were certain episodic transaction fees that contributed to our second quarter's results. As it relates to FRPR in 2023, we continue to expect approximately 95% of our FRPR to be realized in the fourth quarter. Currently, the potential FRPR from our credit funds is tracking well ahead of last year as we're experiencing the benefits of a higher for longer interest rate environment, along with a modestly positive impact on loan pricing from tighter credit spreads. We are currently estimating FRPR from our credit funds of approximately $110 million to $120 million for the fourth quarter or $40 million to $44 million of FRE after compensation expense. I will caveat that, this is still subject to the total return performance of these credit strategies for the full year, including changes in market values in the fourth quarter. Regarding FRPR from our real estate group as of September 30, the two non-traded REITs had not accrued any incentive fees on their balance sheets. Given the upward pressure on cap rates, we do not expect to recognize FRPR from these non-traded REITs in 2023 and earning FRPR in 2024 from these REITs may require an improvement in the current valuation environment. Fee-related earnings totaled $274 million, an increase of 18% from the third quarter of 2022, driven by higher management fees from deployment. For the year-to-date period, we're tracking at over 20% growth in FRE. We remain confident in our ability to generate 20% or better FRE growth annually through 2025, excluding any FRPR from our non-traded REITs as we discussed on our call in February. Our FRE margin in the third quarter was 41.2%, a roughly 40 basis point improvement from the second quarter of 2023, and a 100 basis point improvement from the year ago period. As we have said in the past, we expect to see a gradual expansion in margins that could accelerate in periods of higher deployment and corresponding growth in FPAUM. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter, we typically see a drag on our FRE margins related to FRPR, which are typically in the mid-30% range. Excluding this FRPR impact, we do expect continued modest FRE margin expansion in Q4, and we remain confident in our ability to reach a 45% run rate FRE margin by the end of 2025. Our realization activity was slower in the third quarter due to limited American style realizations in several of our equity strategies, coupled with the typically slow third quarter for European-style waterfall realizations as discussed on our last call. Given the early ages of many of our European waterfall style funds, we typically see tax-related distributions in the fourth quarter with a cleanup amount in the second quarter related to tax filing. However, as our 2017 and 2018 vintage European waterfall style funds continue to season, we expect to see larger and more consistent European waterfall realizations likely beginning in 2025 and thereafter. For the fourth quarter, we currently expect approximately $45 million in European waterfall style net realized performance income. Looking forward, our potential net performance fee income from European style funds as increased from $2.5 billion earlier in the year to $3.5 billion. This potential amount has continued to grow as we raise additional European style funds, along with the compounding effect of higher interest rates in our credit like funds. At the same time, we're seeing the duration of these expected cash flows extend out as there are fewer repayments and less overall transaction activity. The extended fund duration has a positive compounding effect on the total realization value as the investments remain in our portfolio longer, but it impacts the timing of these realizations. Based on our updated estimates and including the fourth quarter guidance I provided, we currently expect approximately $80 million of net realized performance income in 2023 from our EU waterfall funds and about $160 million in 2024. Our initial view is that there's more than $250 million in 2025. Our net accrued performance receivables stood at $969 million, up 9% from the year ago period despite nearly $150 million in distributed net realized performance income over the last 12 months. Notably, approximately $94 million of this increase comes from our credit funds where we're seeing the benefits of higher interest rates above our fixed hurdle rates. Unlike equity style funds, where increases in performance fees are based on capital appreciation driven by market multiples and EBITDA growth, our eligible credit funds can generate more predictable income from net returns after any credit losses above fixed hurdle rates with limited mark-to-market risk. For example, of the $969 million of net accrued performance receivables, $694 million or over 70% were in European style waterfall funds with over $500 million in private credit like funds. We now have nearly $125 billion or over 50% of our incentive eligible AUM in European-style waterfall funds, and we expect this balance will continue to grow. Realized income in the third quarter totaled $264 million and after-tax realized income per share of Class A common stock was $0.83, up 11% compared to the third quarter of 2022. As Mike mentioned earlier, approximately three quarters of our primary investment strategies performed well compared to their respective relative public indices or exceeded their annualized target returns for the third quarter, with particular strength across US direct lending, alternative credit, Asia credit, infrastructure debt and special opportunities. In credit, all of our primary investment strategies have generated double-digit gross returns in the last 12 months as we continue to benefit from higher base rates, attractive spreads, low defaults and strong fundamental performance. Our credit metrics remain strong across our portfolios. As an example, in US direct lending, Ares Capital Corp's non-accruals at cost declined to 1.2%, which remains well below our historical average and the industry averages. And portfolio company EBITDA growth remains in the healthy mid- to high single-digits for our US and European direct lending portfolios. Loan-to-value ratios also remain attractive in the low 40% range in the US and mid-40% for our European portfolios. In private equity, both of our investment strategies performed well compared to the public equity markets in the third quarter. We continue to see double-digit EBITDA growth across our ACOF portfolios. Within real estate, higher cap rates are offsetting the relatively strong rent growth that we're seeing in our portfolios, which are heavily weighted towards a more resilient industrial and multi-family sectors. This is leading to muted returns for the third quarter, yet due to our significant overweighting in these strongest performing sectors of industrial and multifamily, which account for more than 75% of our real estate gross value, our US and European real estate strategies have performed well relative to the respective public real estate markets over the past two years. With that, I'll turn the call back to Mike for closing remarks.\nMichael Arougheti: Great. Thanks, Jarrod. In our view, the long-term secular drivers for our business remain very much intact. Both institutional and retail investors continue to seek higher risk adjusted returns in less volatile and uncorrelated alternative assets. At the same time, we're seeing traditional capital providers and banks continue to retrench for a whole host of reasons, and Ares continues to play a key role in filling the gaps and providing solutions into these markets. As you saw with our performance to date, as well as past market cycles, we can generate strong growth even in tougher market environments. We continue to make investments for future growth by enhancing our product capabilities in adjacent areas, expanding into new geographies and deepening our distribution channels. With a record amount of dry powder, we're well-positioned to invest our capital opportunistically in highly attractive sectors. And because of the scaling of our private credit business over the past six years, we're in a great position to realize a growing amount of performance income in the coming years from our European-style waterfall funds. All of this is to say that we have strong visibility on continued earnings growth, dividend growth and margin expansion. As always, I'm grateful for the hard work and dedication of our team around the globe and I'm appreciative of our investors' continuing support for our company. And operator, I think we can now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Good morning Mike, Jared, I hope everyone is doing well. My first question is an update on the formation of bank partnership and how Ares is working much closer with banks now on asset acquisitions, especially in the ABF market. I think PacWest that purchase in June might have been the last big announcement. So since then, have you been forming new partnerships, are you seeing the flow of assets pick up from banks, and what are your expectations for the future with your bank partners?\nMichael Arougheti: Hi Craig. Thanks for the question. PacWest yes, was the largest transaction that we announced, but I think the press picked up some recent activity too where we did a very significant strategic risk transfer, a couple of weeks back with a regional bank. There's about $2 trillion of consumer loan assets sitting on bank balance sheets that are going to need to get addressed in some form or fashion, not to mention some of the challenges that we expect we'll continue to see in the real estate books. So given that we just had our final close on the Pathfinder, funded $6.6 billion, and given that, that's where the bulk of this activity is going to reside, we're still pretty optimistic that the opportunity to partner with banks is still in the early innings and that we're well positioned for.\nCraig Siegenthaler: And just as my follow-up, a similar question but more on the investing side, focusing on asset-backed finance and the $7 billion Pathfinder fund and I know this vertical now is $32 billion and Ares which is very large. What verticals is Joe [ph] and team focusing on now? Are there any that they're avoiding? And looking at Ares' capabilities pay in the ABF [ph], are you broadly -- do you broadly fill all the verticals? Are there still some white spaces where you could add investment professionals to sort of fill in, in the future?\nMichael Arougheti: Without getting into too many specifics, Craig, I think the good news is we have probably one of the biggest and broadest teams in the space, particularly around the sub-investment grade part of the market which we think requires it [Audio Gap] we're focused on now. We talked about resolution of some consumer loan portfolios and lender finance portfolios within the banking system. In a recent newsletter that, that team put out, there was a pretty good discussion, I thought on the opportunity in NAV lending, which is about a $100 billion opportunity. So I'd say broadly speaking, you want to be in a position to move between markets and geographies as the opportunity set develops. And there are very few people who can make those types of relative value decisions the way that our team can. But yeah, I think for the time being, we're going to be focused on much of the core things that we've been talking about around bank partnerships and lender finance.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Blostein: Hi. Good morning guys. My question for you outside of credit, maybe just a quick refresher on the opportunities you guys see for fundraising over the next call it, six to 12 months, in things like private equity and other verticals. So maybe we could start there.\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. Thanks for the question. As we talked about on prior calls, I think the good news is, year-over-year, you're going to see less dispersion in fundraising outcomes, largely because we have an increased number of larger flagship and core vehicles. Obviously, we're building momentum in the wealth channel and the insurance channel and then the family of open-ended products that are on continuous offer are growing. So we're going into any given year just with a much higher floor to jump off of with the large institutional flagships. As we talked about in the prepared remarks, we'll clean up the large credit funds here towards the end of the year and into the first half of next year. And then we would expect to see first closes towards the end of this year into the beginning of next year for our seventh corporate private equity fund, our sixth infrastructure debt fund, our climate infrastructure funds, so on and so forth. And then the big things on the horizon, I think, for next year are going to be our third special ops fund, our third junior debt fund are probably the two big ones. And then obviously, we'll be growing into our six infrastructure debt fund. So it's interesting, as the product set is growing and diversifying and then we're showing that we can scale vintage over vintage, we're no longer in this world where we're just focusing on a handful of flagships. And you can see that just in terms of the quarter-over-quarter fundraising performance, and I'd expect that to continue into the first half as well.\nAlex Blostein: Great. That helps. Thanks. The second question I had for you guys is zoning in on some of the retail initiatives. Helpful to hear that ASIF is going to be, I guess, on four additional platforms in the first half of next year. Any lessons learned, I guess, from the existing platform and how good of a re-across that could be to some of the other ones that you mentioned, given pretty robust momentum we've seen so far. And then I think you launched a European version of that as well. So maybe help us understand sort of how does the competitive market in Europe, vary versus the US and the opportunity there you see for the European version of this product relative to the early traction you see in the US.\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. Just to frame it, so everybody is looking at the same numbers, we raised in our wealth products alone, they're not looking at our traded product. Wealth product, we did about $1.7 billion in the third quarter, obviously, with good momentum on ASIF with only the one platform. I would expect, Alex, just given the attractiveness of the product at this moment in time in our BDC track record and leadership in private debt that adding those platforms is a pretty good read across. We'll know it when we're in those platforms, just how much they scale. But I think there's a pretty significant amount of pent-up demand and respect for the brand in that channel. And so I think that's a good starting point to expect that it would be a good read across. Europe, it's interesting because the European wealth market generally is less developed. So we just don't have a great amount of precedent to know. But from a competitive standpoint, we have, by far, the leading private credit franchise in that market, both in terms of length of track record, scale of capital and size of team. So it's an interesting, you have a less mature distribution channel, but we have a significantly better competitive positioning, I think, relative to others in that market. And so the two combined hopefully has us having similar experience with that product as we're having with the US product.\nAlex Blostein: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ben Budish with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nBen Budish: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about some of the LP dynamics. We've been seeing some reports in the media, not about Ares specifically, but about private credit in general, things like investors sort of asking for lower hurdles, pricing concessions. We've seen some competitors concede incentive fees in some of their credit funds. Just curious if there's anything you're seeing in your interactions with your clients that are similar to what we've been hearing elsewhere.\nMichael Arougheti: We are absolutely not seeing that in any way, shape or form. I would not read into that at least vis-\u00e0-vis our platform or the market generally. I would maybe just make a comment that to the extent that someone was trying to play catch up in a growing market without a long track record of performance, you might have to cut fee in order to attract capital, but that has not been our experience in one bit.\nBen Budish: All right. That's very clear. Maybe one follow-up. Just thinking -- I know the speed is not a huge portion of your business, but thinking about the expected DOL proposed rule today, the beta fiduciary rule. Can you kind of just remind us what your sort of overall annuity exposure? How much of the business is -- or how much of your growth prospects are sort of reliant on that channel? And what is sort of the makeup of that speed at today? Thanks.\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. And we appreciate your hiring and obviously, this is all unfolding real time. So we're digesting that the same way that you are. We have, as we've said before, taken a more measured approach to the growth of our insurance affiliate with some of our peers. We believe in the investment thesis of asset expertise married with insurance company balance sheets. But continue to have a very large and growing stable of important insurance partners in our third-party business and continue to grow that part of our company as well. Aspida today has raised close to $1 billion of capital and the total AUM there is about $11 billion, $10.6 billion. About 60% of that balance sheet is advised and sub-advised by Ares as one would expect. If you go back to our Investor Day in the summer of 2021, when we put forward our guidance, you'll see that we largely expected that Aspida would grow roughly $5 billion a year to get us to $25 billion of AUM at the end of 2025. So if you looked at the $500 billion that we put out for guidance, $25 billion for Aspida that would have it at about 5% of our assets. And if you look at where we are on that business plan, we're kind of tracking to that. So I would expect that we will continue to grow that in a measured fashion. We do think that we have some technological advantages in terms of the way that we are originating and onboarding new business. And I think as many folks know, we're obviously smaller, but we also do not have any legacy exposures given that this was a de novo build. And so when you look at what is in the book, it's all effectively new vintage credit. So we'll keep an eye on this. But again, I think the good news is for at least for Ares, it's a small part of what we do, and my expectation is that whatever develops here like we've seen in the past, it will largely hopefully be around enhanced disclosures around certain products in the channel, but not really change the economic proposition to the client.\nBen Budish: Got it. Appreciate all the color. Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please proceed with your question. \nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I know real estate is small for you, but could you maybe give some color on where the cap rates are in your non-traded REITs and maybe how much those have changed versus a couple of years ago? You had spoken to the rent growth there as an offset. But just kind of curious about the base cap rates?\nMichael Arougheti: Bill, do you want to take that one? I thought Bill Benjamin, our Head of Real Estate was on. I'm happy to take it. If you look at the non-traded REITs for Q3 this year when you look at what's underpinning the valuation, we had cap rates roughly 5.5% to 5.6% depending on the vehicle. If you go back a year, we were probably 50 to 70 basis points, tight of that 4.8% and 5.2%. So, we have seen cap rate expansion but as we mentioned, given that these funds are largely focused either exclusively on industrial logistics properties and multis, we are continuing to see pretty significant and healthy fundamental performance in terms of NOI growth and the development of the rent rolls.\nBrennan Hawken: Excellent. Thanks for that. And then kind of curious about -- on the European waterfall and expectations for 2024. I believe you said $160 million. But I thought that on the last call, that was more like about $175 million with the potential for upside. So, am I remembering that correctly? And could you maybe walk through what happened to that revision? And how we should be thinking about upside and what can drive that from here?\nJarrod Phillips: Sure, I'll take that one. Ultimately, yes, what we tried to lay out, and we added the 2025 guidance with a little bit more clarity, kind of splitting out the periods between 2024 and 2025. Based on the current market environment, what we're seeing is a little bit of the extension of the duration of the underlying assets of these funds, which means that it pushes out the overall maturity of the fund a little bit, actually ends up being a net positive for us in terms of these are assets -- these are credit assets that are yielding well above the hurdle. But because of the current market environment, they actually aren't refinancing quite as early as they used to. That's what's pushing out that duration. So, ultimately, what we're seeing is a build over a longer period of time with -- now we're expecting it more to land in that 2025 period as opposed to towards the end of 2024. And that's a little bit of what we've seen happen here in Q4 as well as we're expecting kind of a push of some of that in terms of what we've given as guidance in the past into 2024 and then some of that 2024 really extending into 2025. So, I wouldn't really call it a loss of it. It's actually a build and a larger build, but it's pushing it out just a little bit due to the current market environment.\nBrennan Hawken: Got it. And is it possible for that duration to continue to get extended, if we see conditions remain challenging for refi or that like a realistic worst case scenario right now?\nJarrod Phillips: Yes, not too much because we're really approaching the natural maturity of a lot of those assets. So, it's really just in terms of what the refi activity looks like. And if the market picks up, well, that could all cause refinances and turnover in those earlier portfolios which would then accelerate the recognition of that. So, it's really just a matter of what is the exact timing. We know what the total amount could be and the total amount continues to grow. It's when that will perfectly occur and there's kind of arbitrary dates along the way.\nBrennan Hawken: Got it. Thanks for walking me through that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Worthington: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question. Maybe first on the fundraising guide. I think the -- your comments that you're on track for $65 billion this year suggests a recently reasonable slowdown in fourth quarter commitments. Is that just you being conservative, or did some funds that you expect in 4Q maybe get pushed to 1Q. Can you give us a little more flavor there?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, I think we said in excess of $65 billion, Ken, just because as you get into the end of the year, you have certain things that will either be pulled forward or roll. So I think we're just trying to be cautious given that some things may slip, but the funds that we've articulated are all in the process of having their closes here in the fourth quarter, one or two may slip, one or two may not, and that's really going to drive the ultimate change, but there's nothing other than timing affecting what the ultimate outcome is going to be.\nKen Worthington: Okay. Great. I sort of figured that. In Alt Credit, I think there's been a talk of a rush of deals to come before year-end. Is that what you're expecting? And what's driving this push into year-end?\nMichael Arougheti: I think the pipeline there is building significantly. It's probably one of the busiest parts of the firm right now. A lot of this is Basel end game driven and I think just folks trying to get focused on balance sheet composition and construction going into the end of the year. I don't think there's anything more than that, but we are absolutely experiencing that. The pipeline is building, transaction activity there has probably turned on more so than other parts of the firm right now.\nKen Worthington: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. \nMichael Cyprys: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just on commercial real estate, I believe in the past, you've mentioned that you'd expect the bulk of the primary market opportunity out of the regional banks to come from CRE lending. So I guess how much activity have you seen so far on the CRE lending front? What steps might you need to take to enhance the platform, if at all, in terms of hiring or build-out in order to best capture the market opportunity set that you guys see?\nMichael Arougheti: Thanks, Mike. Yes, I don't think that we need to do a lot more than we're currently doing. We have a very well-developed team, both in the US and in Europe. We've been building capability in Asia Pacific as well. As we highlighted on our prepared remarks, we have been forming capital and we'll continue to do so. I think when you think about what's going on in the world of commercial real estate and the change in basis, most of the exciting stuff is going to be happening in the top to middle part of the balance sheet of these entities, and that's going to be a combination of real estate lending, solutions, real estate secondaries, structured equity through our opportunistic real estate business. And obviously, we have large teams against all three of those. So I think the bigger issue is really going to be investor behavior because as much as everybody appreciates how big of an opportunity that is, you have a lot of investors that are also playing defense within their existing exposures. And until they kind of get their heads around what it is that they currently own, I think it's going to be a little hard for them to get on offense. So I think for me, it's really going to be all on the capital side, not the capability side.\nMichael Cyprys: Okay. Thanks. And just a follow-up question. I wanted to circle back to your comments on deployment. I think you mentioned that you were encouraged by the activity so far here in the fourth quarter and the pipeline. I think you mentioned alternative credit busiest as part of the firm. Just wanted to double-click on that. If you could maybe just elaborate a little bit more, picked up in the third quarter here, but what's the opportunity set for the deployment activity to broaden out beyond alternative credit, beyond credit and to some of the other areas of the firm? And how do you see deployment activity evolving as you look out over the next 12 months to 24 months. So maybe you could just remind us around some of the seasonality. Does that broadly pick up in 4Q and then slow down in the first quarter?\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. I'll try to hit this from a couple of different places. Number one, I think given the diversity of strategies that we have, similar to my comments on fundraising, I'll make a similar commentary on deployment, which is when you look at the deployment experience, you'll see obviously a slowdown but on a relative basis, still healthy deployment. So if you look at a year ago, in Q3 2022, we deployed about $18.3 billion, obviously led by credit. And in Q3 2023, we deployed $16.7 billion. That was up from 15.2% last quarter. So you kind of begin to see these ranges emerge. If you look at it on an LTM basis, LTM this year, about $66 billion, LTM last year, about $90 billion. So obviously, if we get into a market where we're seeing heightened transaction activity, that also gives you another way to think about the range of outcomes and then just measure that against the $100 billion of dry powder that we referenced earlier and we'll give you a general sense for where we are from a deployment opportunity standpoint as we deploy the dry powder. Most of what is happening now and it goes back to what I just talked about with real estate, is going to be in and around the opportunistic side of the business, rescue lending, opportunistic refinancings, secondaries, structured equity, et cetera, because the new issue volumes both in corporate private equity and institutional real estate are slow. We continue to have a competitive advantage just given our incumbency and the size of our portfolio. So if you look at our US and European direct lending portfolios, you'll see continuing 40% to 50% of deal volume at Ares is coming from the installed book of business. And so that's a nice ballast as you think about the ability to deploy into a tougher new issue market. I am optimistic that, that transaction volume will pick up. We're seeing it build in the pipelines. If you talk to the sell side, they'll tell you that there's a significant pent-up demand for asset sales to be coming to market. We're seeing it across the platform. But the math of it, if you just look at, for example, private equity and you say, today, buyout funds are sitting on about $2.8 trillion of un-exited assets relative to about $1.1 trillion of dry powder. And if you look at that installed base or the aging of it, 50% of the companies that are currently owned by buyout funds are -- have been owned in excess of four years. And so if you just think about the weight of that money needing to transact and return capital to LPs, while most of what we're doing is kind of on that opportunistic side, I still believe that you're going to see new transaction volumes pick up, particularly now that you're getting into a stabilized rate environment.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question.\nPatrick Davitt: Hi. Thanks for the question. A quick follow-up on that one. Is the cadence of the pipeline building more of a 2024 pop or should we expect to pick up more immediately in 4Q?\nMichael Arougheti: I think Q4 is shaping up nicely. Again, it's always -- there's always a seasonal pickup in Q4 as people rush to get deals done by year-end, typically just around tax planning and closing out the year. So there's always a flurry of activity towards the end of the year. Sometimes that slips, sometimes it doesn't. But I would expect that it will be a nice ramp through Q4 and then into Q1 based on everything I'm seeing.\nPatrick Davitt: Great. And then a higher-level question. There was a rating agency out last week with a report showing large direct lending deals increasingly coming with no maintenance covenants. I think trying to argue that there's more pressure to converge terms with the broadly syndicated market. I'm not sure how they even know that given these are private deals, but is that a trend you're seeing? Is Ares participating? And if so, what is the argument, I guess, for lowering your protection\u2026?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. I don't really know -- to your point, I don't know where that's coming from and you can't paint the entire private credit market with the same brush. I'll make a couple of comments. I do think that in some of these private executions that are syndicated loan proxies, one would expect that some syndicated loan documentation terms would find their way into the private market. That to me is not really newsworthy or noteworthy. In the core middle market, that is not the case. The structures continue to be strong. They're as good as we've ever seen the pendulum has swung to be obviously more lender-friendly than borrower-friendly. And so it feels a little sensational, but -- and I would expect that, that will continue. The other thing I would just point out, if you actually go back and look at the history of covenant-light loans, there's no evidence to say that covenant-light loans actually performed worse than covenanted loans. And I think the reason is twofold. One, the best quality credits are those that can actually command better structures. And number two, sad as it may be, oftentimes in syndicated structures, many of the participants in those syndicates of different structural constraints or agendas and so when you get into a restructuring conversation, you may have a CLO that can't put new money in or can't take a ratings downgrade. You may have a credit fund that is at the end of fund life and can't participate in a junior security. And so, there's all sorts of friction that you see in those syndicated loans that, frankly, when you have no covenants, it's protective of value. And I think that's you could argue pretty strongly the covenant-light loans for the best borrowers will actually outperform. That's actually what we saw happen through the GFC. I'd make one last comment, which is why I think everybody is so excited about private credit relative to traded credit, at least vis-\u00e0-vis defaults and loss given default. When you are in a private credit instrument, covenanted or not covenanted, it's a bilateral agreement between a borrower and a lender or a very small lender group and there is no ability for anyone else in the market with a different agenda or different entry point to come into that security and destroy value. And oftentimes, in the traded market, obviously, you can see people coming into capital structure and being disruptive in a way that you just don't see in the private market. So even in the absence of covenants, they performed differently because you restructure them through a bilateral negotiation between borrower and lender and the deals that are getting done are no different than what we've seen for the last 30 years.\nPatrick Davitt: Excellent. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Mike Brown with KBW. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Brown: Great. I just wanted to follow up on the European waterfall fund dynamic. So Jarrod, it sounds like the amount that you guys were guiding to for the cumulative 2024 and 2025 period would be about in line with the base estimate that you had talked about in the past. You did talk about potential for a high estimate of 650 previously, if I recall correctly. So should we just assume that, that perhaps has been pushed out based on some of the duration commentary that you talked about, or does that high estimate still hold and it's just a matter of the range is still somewhat wide and timing is still relatively uncertain at this point?\nJarrod Phillips: I think it's more a case of that. It's -- in terms of looking at the overall environment, again, as I mentioned earlier in the call, if we start to see repayments happen faster, well, you're going to come closer to that higher end of the range because you're pulling a lot of that up. We're trying to be as accurate as we can with that lower end of the range. But yes, I wouldn't say that there's really a change to the range. The good news is as I mentioned earlier, again, is that the crude balance continues to grow, and this is actually an advantageous market for that to be occurring in terms of extending the duration.\nMike Brown: Okay. Great. Thanks for that clarification. And I guess, the credit metrics, they just continue to hold up really well and seem to really be outperforming expectations. What is really kind of driving that strength in your view here, particularly for Ares? And then when does the pressure from higher rates on cash flows really start to have a greater impact? What kind of be your outlook here on the credit side, if we think out over the next 12 months to 18 months?\nMichael Arougheti: It's funny because we have not been in the recession camp for quite some time. And I think everyone just continues to hope for it, for some reason, it's just not coming. And the simple answer without being cheeky is we just put up a 4.5% plus GDP print in the quarter and the economy is really strong, and we're seeing that play out in our portfolios, and we've tried to articulate that one of the benefits that we have, given the breadth of our platform is that we're seeing private market information roll through on a monthly basis. And for the most part, we're seeing broad strength. There are obviously pockets of the economy that are weakening. There are certain segments of the consumer economy that are weaker, but taken in the aggregate, it paints a picture of continued economic strength. I think Kipp and the team have done a good job talking about the credit metrics at ARCC, and I'd reiterate they're consistent across the private credit book. But the biggest protection is coming from the loan to value positioning of those portfolios and the continued growth in EBITDA, which is obviously promoting dollar deleveraging. If you look at where those books sit today, they're at about 1.6 times to 1.7 times interest coverage ratio on a very conservative definition of interest coverage, meaning pro forma for today's rate environment, not trailing. And I think we all would agree that whether we get one or two hikes here that we're towards the end. And so I think we feel more confident that we have, that we know that we're in a safe place in terms of the interest coverage ratio. Obviously, at these levels, if rates stay higher for a longer, any diminishment in fundamental performance, you'll be having more conversations with more owners of companies and assets that we're having now but again, I just want to highlight that is not necessarily a bad thing for credit performance. And if the past is any indicator, that probably has those books generating higher net rates of return, given their ability to participate in equity value and to get incremental margin and fees. And so again, I think the books are in a really good spot right now.\nMike Brown: Okay. Great. Thank you, Mike and Thank you, Jarrod\nOperator: And we have reached the end of question-and-answer session. Therefore, I will turn the call back over to Michael Arougheti for closing remarks.\nCarl Drake: Operator, Craig Siegenthaler missed the answer to one question, so we're going to repeat that before Mike's closing remarks. Craig asked what verticals in the alternative credit space as he most focused on or we're most focused on, what are we avoiding and as Ares need to move this business further horizontally to fill in additional white spaces where you might now have investment staff today.\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. So I hope what I say now is consistent with what I said before, at least for what you guys heard. Look, the simple answer is I do not think that we need to add capability. One of the reasons why our business is growing the way that it is, is that we are one of the larger teams and one of the better capitalized platforms in the market. We have a fully developed capability around most of the important relevant large segments of alternative credit, and that is a big advantage. This is a market that like other parts of the private credit landscape is moving to scale. We're obviously growing alongside of it. And as we grow, we continue to invest in capability, both in different geographies and around different asset classes. But not a big build in order to capture the full market opportunity. So again, it's going to be about just continuing to form capital, drive partnerships with other market participants and the banks. Places that we're spending a lot of time on right now, as we've talked about are bank asset portfolios and lender finance, including NAV lending. NAV lending is a $100 billion market opportunity in my estimation, and we're uniquely positioned to execute. We are working on a number of what I would call rescue loans and structured equity type investments into the financial services market for good platforms with bad balance sheets. And so I'd expect that you'll see more of that. Eventually, I think the consumer part of the business will turn on. As I said earlier, there's about $2 trillion of consumer loans sitting on bank balance sheets that we think are going to need some form of resolution, which is a pretty big addressable market for us. And Craig had asked if there are things that we avoid. I think generally, the team has done a good job saying that there are certain things that we categorically avoid like patent litigation, for example, or viaticales. But at the end of the day, the whole reason for this platform to exist is to be able to move around with a really good relative value lens between the different parts of the alternative credit landscape in the different geographies. So we're pretty excited about what lies ahead for that team. Okay. So thanks, Carl, for pulling us back online. And sorry, Craig, that we didn't get to you the first time around. I didn't have anything to say other than, again, to thank everybody for their time today and continued support. We look forward to seeing everybody next quarter, and happy Halloween.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our conference call for today.

            "name": "Jarrod Phillips",
            "content": "Thanks Mike. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. In the third quarter, we continue to see strong growth in our management fees, fee-related earnings, AUM and fee paying AUM compared to the third quarter of 2022. While realizations were light in the third quarter as we expected, we have a clear line of sight on stronger fourth quarter realizations, due to our European-style waterfall funds. We're also on track to recognize a meaningful year-over-year increase in FRPR from our credit funds, as I will discuss. Starting with AUM. We ended the third quarter with $395 billion of AUM and we're tracking well to meet or exceed our target of $500 million or more by the end of 2025. Our FPAUM grew to over $247 billion, up from over $218 billion this time last year, driven by deployment across our credit and special opportunities funds and new commitments to funds in our Real Assets group. For the first time in our firm's history, we have over $100 billion in dry powder, of which over $65 billion is AUM not yet paying fees and available for future deployment. Upon deployment, this would generate nearly $650 million in incremental management fees and position us for continued FRE growth and margin efficiencies. From a revenue perspective, our management fees totaled over $643 million in the quarter, an increase of 17% compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by deployment of our available capital in our credit group. Other fee income of approximately $20 million was down from the prior period as there were certain episodic transaction fees that contributed to our second quarter's results. As it relates to FRPR in 2023, we continue to expect approximately 95% of our FRPR to be realized in the fourth quarter. Currently, the potential FRPR from our credit funds is tracking well ahead of last year as we're experiencing the benefits of a higher for longer interest rate environment, along with a modestly positive impact on loan pricing from tighter credit spreads. We are currently estimating FRPR from our credit funds of approximately $110 million to $120 million for the fourth quarter or $40 million to $44 million of FRE after compensation expense. I will caveat that, this is still subject to the total return performance of these credit strategies for the full year, including changes in market values in the fourth quarter. Regarding FRPR from our real estate group as of September 30, the two non-traded REITs had not accrued any incentive fees on their balance sheets. Given the upward pressure on cap rates, we do not expect to recognize FRPR from these non-traded REITs in 2023 and earning FRPR in 2024 from these REITs may require an improvement in the current valuation environment. Fee-related earnings totaled $274 million, an increase of 18% from the third quarter of 2022, driven by higher management fees from deployment. For the year-to-date period, we're tracking at over 20% growth in FRE. We remain confident in our ability to generate 20% or better FRE growth annually through 2025, excluding any FRPR from our non-traded REITs as we discussed on our call in February. Our FRE margin in the third quarter was 41.2%, a roughly 40 basis point improvement from the second quarter of 2023, and a 100 basis point improvement from the year ago period. As we have said in the past, we expect to see a gradual expansion in margins that could accelerate in periods of higher deployment and corresponding growth in FPAUM. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter, we typically see a drag on our FRE margins related to FRPR, which are typically in the mid-30% range. Excluding this FRPR impact, we do expect continued modest FRE margin expansion in Q4, and we remain confident in our ability to reach a 45% run rate FRE margin by the end of 2025. Our realization activity was slower in the third quarter due to limited American style realizations in several of our equity strategies, coupled with the typically slow third quarter for European-style waterfall realizations as discussed on our last call. Given the early ages of many of our European waterfall style funds, we typically see tax-related distributions in the fourth quarter with a cleanup amount in the second quarter related to tax filing. However, as our 2017 and 2018 vintage European waterfall style funds continue to season, we expect to see larger and more consistent European waterfall realizations likely beginning in 2025 and thereafter. For the fourth quarter, we currently expect approximately $45 million in European waterfall style net realized performance income. Looking forward, our potential net performance fee income from European style funds as increased from $2.5 billion earlier in the year to $3.5 billion. This potential amount has continued to grow as we raise additional European style funds, along with the compounding effect of higher interest rates in our credit like funds. At the same time, we're seeing the duration of these expected cash flows extend out as there are fewer repayments and less overall transaction activity. The extended fund duration has a positive compounding effect on the total realization value as the investments remain in our portfolio longer, but it impacts the timing of these realizations. Based on our updated estimates and including the fourth quarter guidance I provided, we currently expect approximately $80 million of net realized performance income in 2023 from our EU waterfall funds and about $160 million in 2024. Our initial view is that there's more than $250 million in 2025. Our net accrued performance receivables stood at $969 million, up 9% from the year ago period despite nearly $150 million in distributed net realized performance income over the last 12 months. Notably, approximately $94 million of this increase comes from our credit funds where we're seeing the benefits of higher interest rates above our fixed hurdle rates. Unlike equity style funds, where increases in performance fees are based on capital appreciation driven by market multiples and EBITDA growth, our eligible credit funds can generate more predictable income from net returns after any credit losses above fixed hurdle rates with limited mark-to-market risk. For example, of the $969 million of net accrued performance receivables, $694 million or over 70% were in European style waterfall funds with over $500 million in private credit like funds. We now have nearly $125 billion or over 50% of our incentive eligible AUM in European-style waterfall funds, and we expect this balance will continue to grow. Realized income in the third quarter totaled $264 million and after-tax realized income per share of Class A common stock was $0.83, up 11% compared to the third quarter of 2022. As Mike mentioned earlier, approximately three quarters of our primary investment strategies performed well compared to their respective relative public indices or exceeded their annualized target returns for the third quarter, with particular strength across US direct lending, alternative credit, Asia credit, infrastructure debt and special opportunities. In credit, all of our primary investment strategies have generated double-digit gross returns in the last 12 months as we continue to benefit from higher base rates, attractive spreads, low defaults and strong fundamental performance. Our credit metrics remain strong across our portfolios. As an example, in US direct lending, Ares Capital Corp's non-accruals at cost declined to 1.2%, which remains well below our historical average and the industry averages. And portfolio company EBITDA growth remains in the healthy mid- to high single-digits for our US and European direct lending portfolios. Loan-to-value ratios also remain attractive in the low 40% range in the US and mid-40% for our European portfolios. In private equity, both of our investment strategies performed well compared to the public equity markets in the third quarter. We continue to see double-digit EBITDA growth across our ACOF portfolios. Within real estate, higher cap rates are offsetting the relatively strong rent growth that we're seeing in our portfolios, which are heavily weighted towards a more resilient industrial and multi-family sectors. This is leading to muted returns for the third quarter, yet due to our significant overweighting in these strongest performing sectors of industrial and multifamily, which account for more than 75% of our real estate gross value, our US and European real estate strategies have performed well relative to the respective public real estate markets over the past two years. With that, I'll turn the call back to Mike for closing remarks. Sure, I'll take that one. Ultimately, yes, what we tried to lay out, and we added the 2025 guidance with a little bit more clarity, kind of splitting out the periods between 2024 and 2025. Based on the current market environment, what we're seeing is a little bit of the extension of the duration of the underlying assets of these funds, which means that it pushes out the overall maturity of the fund a little bit, actually ends up being a net positive for us in terms of these are assets -- these are credit assets that are yielding well above the hurdle. But because of the current market environment, they actually aren't refinancing quite as early as they used to. That's what's pushing out that duration. So, ultimately, what we're seeing is a build over a longer period of time with -- now we're expecting it more to land in that 2025 period as opposed to towards the end of 2024. And that's a little bit of what we've seen happen here in Q4 as well as we're expecting kind of a push of some of that in terms of what we've given as guidance in the past into 2024 and then some of that 2024 really extending into 2025. So, I wouldn't really call it a loss of it. It's actually a build and a larger build, but it's pushing it out just a little bit due to the current market environment. Yes, not too much because we're really approaching the natural maturity of a lot of those assets. So, it's really just in terms of what the refi activity looks like. And if the market picks up, well, that could all cause refinances and turnover in those earlier portfolios which would then accelerate the recognition of that. So, it's really just a matter of what is the exact timing. We know what the total amount could be and the total amount continues to grow. It's when that will perfectly occur and there's kind of arbitrary dates along the way. I think it's more a case of that. It's -- in terms of looking at the overall environment, again, as I mentioned earlier in the call, if we start to see repayments happen faster, well, you're going to come closer to that higher end of the range because you're pulling a lot of that up. We're trying to be as accurate as we can with that lower end of the range. But yes, I wouldn't say that there's really a change to the range. The good news is as I mentioned earlier, again, is that the crude balance continues to grow, and this is actually an advantageous market for that to be occurring in terms of extending the duration."

            "name": "Michael Arougheti",
            "content": "Thank you, Carl and good morning. Before we begin, I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge the horrific terrorist attacks that occurred in Israel and the subsequent loss of lives. Our hearts go out to all the innocent people and for the pain and suffering on both sides throughout the region. We are all holding on to hope for a peaceful resolution. Now, I'd like to begin with some market commentary and quarterly business and strategic highlights. During the third quarter, the markets adjusted to the expectation for rates to stay higher for longer while the underlying economy remained resilient, with robust GDP, a strong labor market, and continued modest growth in corporate profits. We're seeing the lag effects from higher rates and the slow and uneven economic growth play out across the global markets that we invest in. Transaction activity remains slower than usual due to the higher cost of capital and valuation disparities among buyers and sellers yet there's significant pent-up demand and a large amount of aging private equity dry powder available to be invested. We're seeing our private pipeline build generally with higher quality assets and strong growth characteristics coming to market. We're also seeing a growing need for creative liquidity solutions, recapitalizations and rescue financings, and more interest in secondaries. With this economic backdrop, it remains a compelling time to invest across private market assets with defensive characteristics, particularly within private credit, as we see risk/reward characteristics that are as favorable as we've seen in many years. Our quarterly results continue to demonstrate our strong growth and resiliency in these slower and more challenging market environments. We raised $21.9 billion in new commitments in the quarter, our second highest fundraising quarter in the history of our firm, and we've now raised $53.4 billion through the end of the third quarter. We continue to benefit from our existing institutional investors who re-up or cross over into new Ares Fund products, along with new investors who recognize our consistent fund performance and leadership in managing private assets. We also saw an increase in flows from our wealth management channel, supported by our newly launched non-traded BDC. Fund [ph] performance across our primary investment strategies also continues to be a highlight as approximately three quarters of those strategies performed well compared to their respective relative public indices or exceeded their annualized target returns in the third quarter. We also incrementally increased our third quarter deployment, which supported growth in our management fees and fee-related earnings. For the first nine months, our management fees and fee-related earnings each grew by 20% or better compared to the same period last year. Now let me provide an update on our three private credit funds, which are all on track or have already closed at levels in excess of prior vintages. In the third quarter, we held the first close for our third US senior direct lending fund of nearly $6.5 billion in equity commitments plus nearly $2 billion in committed fund leverage. The first closing of LP commitments for this fund exceeded 80% of the total equity commitments for the predecessor fund. With additional closes expected into the first half of next year, we expect to meaningfully exceed the prior fund size of $8 billion in equity commitments and $15 billion in total investable capital. Overall, our US direct lending business raised $11.6 billion in the third quarter which brought our total AUM in this strategy to nearly $118 billion. As a market leader, we believe that our global direct lending business continues to have significant white space as the private credit markets are meaningfully undersized compared to the $5 trillion of private equity AUM. We also raised an additional \u20ac750 million for our sixth European direct lending fund in the third quarter and almost \u20ac800 million more in October, bringing total commitments to \u20ac9.9 billion to date. We have line of sight to over \u20ac11 billion of equity commitments by year-end which would equal or exceed our prior fund vintage. We expect to surpass our prior vintage with additional closings from investors in our pipeline by early in the second quarter of 2024. With over 85 investment professionals located in six offices across Europe, we believe that we have the largest and most tenured direct lending franchise on the continent, managing over $60 billion of AUM. With our leading alternative credit strategy, Pathfinder II closed approximately $2.2 billion in the third quarter, bringing total commitments to $5.8 billion at quarter end. And as we publicly announced yesterday, Pathfinder II held its final close at its hard cap of $6.6 billion, nearly double the size of the predecessor fund. We experienced significant investor demand hitting our hard cap in only seven months since the first closing. In addition to Pathfinder II, our open-end core alternative credit fund raised $750 million in the quarter, bringing total commitments to over $4.2 billion. The strong investor demand for alternative credit strategies is driven in part by filling the gaps created by a pullback from traditional providers, along with the structural changes that we're witnessing in the banking industry. With more than $32 billion in AUM, our alternative credit business is a leader in the private, non-rated and illiquid segment of the asset-backed market and is poised for growth in what we believe is at least a $4 trillion global addressable market. In Asia credit, we raised nearly $400 million in the quarter, including an approximate $200 million final close in Ares SSG Capital Partners VI, bringing final commitments to $2.4 billion, including a Sidecar fund. We're seeing strong economic trends and robust corporate earnings growth in India and Australia, which account for 60% of our investments across the region, and we're seeing a growing opportunity set for financing solutions for sponsor-led acquisitions in these markets. Within Real Assets, we raised more than $500 million in a European real estate debt mandate, which now totals over $1 billion, and we anticipate that this strategy will continue to grow. Our real estate debt business now exceeds $11 billion, and we believe the team is well positioned for further growth due to investor demand and the current acute need for capital in the industry. Our second climate infrastructure fund raised another $200 million in the quarter, plus an additional $300 million in October, and this completed the funds closed with total equity commitments of nearly $1.1 billion or approximately 80% of the total equity commitments in the prior fund vintage. We currently have over 30 funds in the market, and by year-end, we expect to have first closes in our seventh corporate private equity fund, our inaugural credit secondaries fund and our third infrastructure secondaries fund, as well as additional closings in our larger funds, such as our fourth US opportunistic real estate equity fund, our second climate infrastructure fund and our sixth European Direct Lending fund, as just discussed. Through the end of October, we have now raised nearly $58 billion, and we expect total fundraising for the year to exceed $65 billion, well ahead of the $57 billion we raised last year. Throughout next year, we have several of our largest fund series expected to hold first closings for successor funds, including our six infrastructure debt fund, our third special opportunities fund and our third US junior direct lending fund. While our core fundraising continues to be supported by expanding within the global institutional market, our strategically important insurance and wealth management channels are also poised for growth. Our affiliated insurance business, Aspida, continued its organic growth with new assets of more than $1 billion, bringing total AUM to $10.6 billion by quarter end. We believe investors are attracted not only to Ares' credit investing expertise, but also the technological advantages that Aspida is bringing to the annuity market. Our growth outlook is promising as we're seeing demand for new annuities, reinsurance flow and opportunities for block trades, which we would expect to fund largely with third-party capital. We believe that we are on track to meet or exceed our goal of reaching $25 billion or more in AUM by the end of 2025. Within Wealth Management, our ongoing objective is to market a limited number of core semi-liquid institutional quality products through our global wealth management channel. We're well on our way to accomplishing this over the next several years and today, we're one of the largest alternative managers in the wealth industry with over 120 professionals, a footprint across North America, Europe and Asia, six products and relationships with nearly every major warehouse and private bank. We expect to continue adding strategic partnerships and gain market share as we scale each one of these products. After launching our non-traded BDC, ASIF, primarily on one wire house in June, that has seen steady momentum with approximately $550 million raised in the first three months, including the September flows, which closed on October 1, bringing total AUM to over $2.7 billion. There are four additional global platforms that we expect will add ASIF in the first half of 2024. And despite a tough market for real estate fundraising, we continue to see net aggregate flows collectively across our two non-traded REITs, including the 1031 exchange programs. Turning to deployment. We invested $16.7 billion in the third quarter, which was up from the $15.2 billion in the second quarter, but down from $18.3 billion in the third quarter of 2022. We're beginning to see signs of large deal activity returning as Q3 was the third highest quarter for $1 billion plug tranche deals financed by the private credit markets. While still early and markets remain slower than we'd like, we're encouraged by our fourth quarter-to-date investment activity and our pipeline. For 2024, we currently expect market activity to improve due to the aging private equity dry powder that is approaching the end of its investment period, growing pressure from LPs to return capital, stronger sentiment among middle market companies and further pressure on balance sheets and capital structures as rates stay higher for longer. We're also seeing a growing opportunity to partner with the banking sector through our alternative credit business. The bank market continues to be impacted by regulatory changes, asset liability mismatches and an inverted yield curve, all of which changed the way banks participate in certain segments of the market. Over the years, we've developed extensive bank partnerships where we have the opportunity to provide solutions to augment their existing businesses to improve risk weightings and reduce capital charges, while at the same time generate attractive returns for our investors. Our alternative credit team believes that we're in the early innings of these types of transactions and we're seeing an increase in our collaboration with our banking partners. Finally, we continue to explore inorganic growth opportunities to expand our business through both product and geographic expansion. In October, we closed on the acquisition of Crescent Point, a leading Asia-focused private equity firm with $3.7 billion in assets under management. The Asia Pacific region is a key geographic target for us and we continue to look at various ways to expand each of our business lines into that region, either through organic team builds or strategic acquisitions. And as you may have seen, we also recently closed a strategic partnership and investment in Vinci Partners, a leading alternative asset manager in Latin America. We've known the Vinci team for over a decade and are excited to collaborate on distribution, product development and other business opportunities in Brazil and across Latin America. We believe that the Latin American markets are in the very early stages of shifting capital into the private markets, particularly within private credit. This is similar to the trends that we saw in the early 2000s in Europe, and what we're seeing now beginning to play out in the APAC region. We'll continue to look for unique and attractive global growth opportunities for our business. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jarrod for comments on our financial results. Jarrod? Great. Thanks, Jarrod. In our view, the long-term secular drivers for our business remain very much intact. Both institutional and retail investors continue to seek higher risk adjusted returns in less volatile and uncorrelated alternative assets. At the same time, we're seeing traditional capital providers and banks continue to retrench for a whole host of reasons, and Ares continues to play a key role in filling the gaps and providing solutions into these markets. As you saw with our performance to date, as well as past market cycles, we can generate strong growth even in tougher market environments. We continue to make investments for future growth by enhancing our product capabilities in adjacent areas, expanding into new geographies and deepening our distribution channels. With a record amount of dry powder, we're well-positioned to invest our capital opportunistically in highly attractive sectors. And because of the scaling of our private credit business over the past six years, we're in a great position to realize a growing amount of performance income in the coming years from our European-style waterfall funds. All of this is to say that we have strong visibility on continued earnings growth, dividend growth and margin expansion. As always, I'm grateful for the hard work and dedication of our team around the globe and I'm appreciative of our investors' continuing support for our company. And operator, I think we can now open up the line for questions. Hi Craig. Thanks for the question. PacWest yes, was the largest transaction that we announced, but I think the press picked up some recent activity too where we did a very significant strategic risk transfer, a couple of weeks back with a regional bank. There's about $2 trillion of consumer loan assets sitting on bank balance sheets that are going to need to get addressed in some form or fashion, not to mention some of the challenges that we expect we'll continue to see in the real estate books. So given that we just had our final close on the Pathfinder, funded $6.6 billion, and given that, that's where the bulk of this activity is going to reside, we're still pretty optimistic that the opportunity to partner with banks is still in the early innings and that we're well positioned for. Without getting into too many specifics, Craig, I think the good news is we have probably one of the biggest and broadest teams in the space, particularly around the sub-investment grade part of the market which we think requires it [Audio Gap] we're focused on now. We talked about resolution of some consumer loan portfolios and lender finance portfolios within the banking system. In a recent newsletter that, that team put out, there was a pretty good discussion, I thought on the opportunity in NAV lending, which is about a $100 billion opportunity. So I'd say broadly speaking, you want to be in a position to move between markets and geographies as the opportunity set develops. And there are very few people who can make those types of relative value decisions the way that our team can. But yeah, I think for the time being, we're going to be focused on much of the core things that we've been talking about around bank partnerships and lender finance. Sure. Thanks for the question. As we talked about on prior calls, I think the good news is, year-over-year, you're going to see less dispersion in fundraising outcomes, largely because we have an increased number of larger flagship and core vehicles. Obviously, we're building momentum in the wealth channel and the insurance channel and then the family of open-ended products that are on continuous offer are growing. So we're going into any given year just with a much higher floor to jump off of with the large institutional flagships. As we talked about in the prepared remarks, we'll clean up the large credit funds here towards the end of the year and into the first half of next year. And then we would expect to see first closes towards the end of this year into the beginning of next year for our seventh corporate private equity fund, our sixth infrastructure debt fund, our climate infrastructure funds, so on and so forth. And then the big things on the horizon, I think, for next year are going to be our third special ops fund, our third junior debt fund are probably the two big ones. And then obviously, we'll be growing into our six infrastructure debt fund. So it's interesting, as the product set is growing and diversifying and then we're showing that we can scale vintage over vintage, we're no longer in this world where we're just focusing on a handful of flagships. And you can see that just in terms of the quarter-over-quarter fundraising performance, and I'd expect that to continue into the first half as well. Sure. Just to frame it, so everybody is looking at the same numbers, we raised in our wealth products alone, they're not looking at our traded product. Wealth product, we did about $1.7 billion in the third quarter, obviously, with good momentum on ASIF with only the one platform. I would expect, Alex, just given the attractiveness of the product at this moment in time in our BDC track record and leadership in private debt that adding those platforms is a pretty good read across. We'll know it when we're in those platforms, just how much they scale. But I think there's a pretty significant amount of pent-up demand and respect for the brand in that channel. And so I think that's a good starting point to expect that it would be a good read across. Europe, it's interesting because the European wealth market generally is less developed. So we just don't have a great amount of precedent to know. But from a competitive standpoint, we have, by far, the leading private credit franchise in that market, both in terms of length of track record, scale of capital and size of team. So it's an interesting, you have a less mature distribution channel, but we have a significantly better competitive positioning, I think, relative to others in that market. And so the two combined hopefully has us having similar experience with that product as we're having with the US product. We are absolutely not seeing that in any way, shape or form. I would not read into that at least vis-\u00e0-vis our platform or the market generally. I would maybe just make a comment that to the extent that someone was trying to play catch up in a growing market without a long track record of performance, you might have to cut fee in order to attract capital, but that has not been our experience in one bit. Sure. And we appreciate your hiring and obviously, this is all unfolding real time. So we're digesting that the same way that you are. We have, as we've said before, taken a more measured approach to the growth of our insurance affiliate with some of our peers. We believe in the investment thesis of asset expertise married with insurance company balance sheets. But continue to have a very large and growing stable of important insurance partners in our third-party business and continue to grow that part of our company as well. Aspida today has raised close to $1 billion of capital and the total AUM there is about $11 billion, $10.6 billion. About 60% of that balance sheet is advised and sub-advised by Ares as one would expect. If you go back to our Investor Day in the summer of 2021, when we put forward our guidance, you'll see that we largely expected that Aspida would grow roughly $5 billion a year to get us to $25 billion of AUM at the end of 2025. So if you looked at the $500 billion that we put out for guidance, $25 billion for Aspida that would have it at about 5% of our assets. And if you look at where we are on that business plan, we're kind of tracking to that. So I would expect that we will continue to grow that in a measured fashion. We do think that we have some technological advantages in terms of the way that we are originating and onboarding new business. And I think as many folks know, we're obviously smaller, but we also do not have any legacy exposures given that this was a de novo build. And so when you look at what is in the book, it's all effectively new vintage credit. So we'll keep an eye on this. But again, I think the good news is for at least for Ares, it's a small part of what we do, and my expectation is that whatever develops here like we've seen in the past, it will largely hopefully be around enhanced disclosures around certain products in the channel, but not really change the economic proposition to the client. Bill, do you want to take that one? I thought Bill Benjamin, our Head of Real Estate was on. I'm happy to take it. If you look at the non-traded REITs for Q3 this year when you look at what's underpinning the valuation, we had cap rates roughly 5.5% to 5.6% depending on the vehicle. If you go back a year, we were probably 50 to 70 basis points, tight of that 4.8% and 5.2%. So, we have seen cap rate expansion but as we mentioned, given that these funds are largely focused either exclusively on industrial logistics properties and multis, we are continuing to see pretty significant and healthy fundamental performance in terms of NOI growth and the development of the rent rolls. Yes, I think we said in excess of $65 billion, Ken, just because as you get into the end of the year, you have certain things that will either be pulled forward or roll. So I think we're just trying to be cautious given that some things may slip, but the funds that we've articulated are all in the process of having their closes here in the fourth quarter, one or two may slip, one or two may not, and that's really going to drive the ultimate change, but there's nothing other than timing affecting what the ultimate outcome is going to be. I think the pipeline there is building significantly. It's probably one of the busiest parts of the firm right now. A lot of this is Basel end game driven and I think just folks trying to get focused on balance sheet composition and construction going into the end of the year. I don't think there's anything more than that, but we are absolutely experiencing that. The pipeline is building, transaction activity there has probably turned on more so than other parts of the firm right now. Thanks, Mike. Yes, I don't think that we need to do a lot more than we're currently doing. We have a very well-developed team, both in the US and in Europe. We've been building capability in Asia Pacific as well. As we highlighted on our prepared remarks, we have been forming capital and we'll continue to do so. I think when you think about what's going on in the world of commercial real estate and the change in basis, most of the exciting stuff is going to be happening in the top to middle part of the balance sheet of these entities, and that's going to be a combination of real estate lending, solutions, real estate secondaries, structured equity through our opportunistic real estate business. And obviously, we have large teams against all three of those. So I think the bigger issue is really going to be investor behavior because as much as everybody appreciates how big of an opportunity that is, you have a lot of investors that are also playing defense within their existing exposures. And until they kind of get their heads around what it is that they currently own, I think it's going to be a little hard for them to get on offense. So I think for me, it's really going to be all on the capital side, not the capability side. Sure. I'll try to hit this from a couple of different places. Number one, I think given the diversity of strategies that we have, similar to my comments on fundraising, I'll make a similar commentary on deployment, which is when you look at the deployment experience, you'll see obviously a slowdown but on a relative basis, still healthy deployment. So if you look at a year ago, in Q3 2022, we deployed about $18.3 billion, obviously led by credit. And in Q3 2023, we deployed $16.7 billion. That was up from 15.2% last quarter. So you kind of begin to see these ranges emerge. If you look at it on an LTM basis, LTM this year, about $66 billion, LTM last year, about $90 billion. So obviously, if we get into a market where we're seeing heightened transaction activity, that also gives you another way to think about the range of outcomes and then just measure that against the $100 billion of dry powder that we referenced earlier and we'll give you a general sense for where we are from a deployment opportunity standpoint as we deploy the dry powder. Most of what is happening now and it goes back to what I just talked about with real estate, is going to be in and around the opportunistic side of the business, rescue lending, opportunistic refinancings, secondaries, structured equity, et cetera, because the new issue volumes both in corporate private equity and institutional real estate are slow. We continue to have a competitive advantage just given our incumbency and the size of our portfolio. So if you look at our US and European direct lending portfolios, you'll see continuing 40% to 50% of deal volume at Ares is coming from the installed book of business. And so that's a nice ballast as you think about the ability to deploy into a tougher new issue market. I am optimistic that, that transaction volume will pick up. We're seeing it build in the pipelines. If you talk to the sell side, they'll tell you that there's a significant pent-up demand for asset sales to be coming to market. We're seeing it across the platform. But the math of it, if you just look at, for example, private equity and you say, today, buyout funds are sitting on about $2.8 trillion of un-exited assets relative to about $1.1 trillion of dry powder. And if you look at that installed base or the aging of it, 50% of the companies that are currently owned by buyout funds are -- have been owned in excess of four years. And so if you just think about the weight of that money needing to transact and return capital to LPs, while most of what we're doing is kind of on that opportunistic side, I still believe that you're going to see new transaction volumes pick up, particularly now that you're getting into a stabilized rate environment. I think Q4 is shaping up nicely. Again, it's always -- there's always a seasonal pickup in Q4 as people rush to get deals done by year-end, typically just around tax planning and closing out the year. So there's always a flurry of activity towards the end of the year. Sometimes that slips, sometimes it doesn't. But I would expect that it will be a nice ramp through Q4 and then into Q1 based on everything I'm seeing. Yes. I don't really know -- to your point, I don't know where that's coming from and you can't paint the entire private credit market with the same brush. I'll make a couple of comments. I do think that in some of these private executions that are syndicated loan proxies, one would expect that some syndicated loan documentation terms would find their way into the private market. That to me is not really newsworthy or noteworthy. In the core middle market, that is not the case. The structures continue to be strong. They're as good as we've ever seen the pendulum has swung to be obviously more lender-friendly than borrower-friendly. And so it feels a little sensational, but -- and I would expect that, that will continue. The other thing I would just point out, if you actually go back and look at the history of covenant-light loans, there's no evidence to say that covenant-light loans actually performed worse than covenanted loans. And I think the reason is twofold. One, the best quality credits are those that can actually command better structures. And number two, sad as it may be, oftentimes in syndicated structures, many of the participants in those syndicates of different structural constraints or agendas and so when you get into a restructuring conversation, you may have a CLO that can't put new money in or can't take a ratings downgrade. You may have a credit fund that is at the end of fund life and can't participate in a junior security. And so, there's all sorts of friction that you see in those syndicated loans that, frankly, when you have no covenants, it's protective of value. And I think that's you could argue pretty strongly the covenant-light loans for the best borrowers will actually outperform. That's actually what we saw happen through the GFC. I'd make one last comment, which is why I think everybody is so excited about private credit relative to traded credit, at least vis-\u00e0-vis defaults and loss given default. When you are in a private credit instrument, covenanted or not covenanted, it's a bilateral agreement between a borrower and a lender or a very small lender group and there is no ability for anyone else in the market with a different agenda or different entry point to come into that security and destroy value. And oftentimes, in the traded market, obviously, you can see people coming into capital structure and being disruptive in a way that you just don't see in the private market. So even in the absence of covenants, they performed differently because you restructure them through a bilateral negotiation between borrower and lender and the deals that are getting done are no different than what we've seen for the last 30 years. It's funny because we have not been in the recession camp for quite some time. And I think everyone just continues to hope for it, for some reason, it's just not coming. And the simple answer without being cheeky is we just put up a 4.5% plus GDP print in the quarter and the economy is really strong, and we're seeing that play out in our portfolios, and we've tried to articulate that one of the benefits that we have, given the breadth of our platform is that we're seeing private market information roll through on a monthly basis. And for the most part, we're seeing broad strength. There are obviously pockets of the economy that are weakening. There are certain segments of the consumer economy that are weaker, but taken in the aggregate, it paints a picture of continued economic strength. I think Kipp and the team have done a good job talking about the credit metrics at ARCC, and I'd reiterate they're consistent across the private credit book. But the biggest protection is coming from the loan to value positioning of those portfolios and the continued growth in EBITDA, which is obviously promoting dollar deleveraging. If you look at where those books sit today, they're at about 1.6 times to 1.7 times interest coverage ratio on a very conservative definition of interest coverage, meaning pro forma for today's rate environment, not trailing. And I think we all would agree that whether we get one or two hikes here that we're towards the end. And so I think we feel more confident that we have, that we know that we're in a safe place in terms of the interest coverage ratio. Obviously, at these levels, if rates stay higher for a longer, any diminishment in fundamental performance, you'll be having more conversations with more owners of companies and assets that we're having now but again, I just want to highlight that is not necessarily a bad thing for credit performance. And if the past is any indicator, that probably has those books generating higher net rates of return, given their ability to participate in equity value and to get incremental margin and fees. And so again, I think the books are in a really good spot right now. Sure. So I hope what I say now is consistent with what I said before, at least for what you guys heard. Look, the simple answer is I do not think that we need to add capability. One of the reasons why our business is growing the way that it is, is that we are one of the larger teams and one of the better capitalized platforms in the market. We have a fully developed capability around most of the important relevant large segments of alternative credit, and that is a big advantage. This is a market that like other parts of the private credit landscape is moving to scale. We're obviously growing alongside of it. And as we grow, we continue to invest in capability, both in different geographies and around different asset classes. But not a big build in order to capture the full market opportunity. So again, it's going to be about just continuing to form capital, drive partnerships with other market participants and the banks. Places that we're spending a lot of time on right now, as we've talked about are bank asset portfolios and lender finance, including NAV lending. NAV lending is a $100 billion market opportunity in my estimation, and we're uniquely positioned to execute. We are working on a number of what I would call rescue loans and structured equity type investments into the financial services market for good platforms with bad balance sheets. And so I'd expect that you'll see more of that. Eventually, I think the consumer part of the business will turn on. As I said earlier, there's about $2 trillion of consumer loans sitting on bank balance sheets that we think are going to need some form of resolution, which is a pretty big addressable market for us. And Craig had asked if there are things that we avoid. I think generally, the team has done a good job saying that there are certain things that we categorically avoid like patent litigation, for example, or viaticales. But at the end of the day, the whole reason for this platform to exist is to be able to move around with a really good relative value lens between the different parts of the alternative credit landscape in the different geographies. So we're pretty excited about what lies ahead for that team. Okay. So thanks, Carl, for pulling us back online. And sorry, Craig, that we didn't get to you the first time around. I didn't have anything to say other than, again, to thank everybody for their time today and continued support. We look forward to seeing everybody next quarter, and happy Halloween."

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Tuesday, August 1, 2023. I will now turn the call over to Carl Drake, Head of Public Markets and Investor Relations for Ares Management.\nCarl Drake: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for our second quarter conference call. I'm joined today by Michael Aragetti, our Chief Executive Officer; and Jarrod Phillips, our Chief Financial Officer. We will also have a number of executives with us today who will be available during the Q&A session. Before we begin, I want to remind you that comments made during this call contain forward-looking statements and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those identified in the risk factors in our SEC filings. Our actual results could differ materially, and we undertake no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Please also note that past performance is not a guarantee of future results. And nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Ares Fund. During this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Please refer to our second quarter earnings presentation available on the Investor Resources section of our website for reconciliations of the measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Note that we plan to file our Form 10-Q later this month. This morning, we announced that we declared our third quarter common dividend of $0.77 per share on the company's Class A and non-voting common stock. Representing an increase of 26% over our dividend for the same quarter a year ago. The dividend will be paid on September 29 to holders of record on September 15. Now I'll turn the call over to Michael Arougheti, who will start with some quarterly business and strategic highlights.\nMichael Arougheti: Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon. I hope everybody is doing well. During the second quarter, the equity and credit markets generated strong investment returns as the U.S. economy remained resilient despite a rapid increase in interest rates over the past 12 months. While transaction activity remains slower than last year, it is recovering modestly as market participants gain more confidence in transacting with improved visibility to the end of the Fed hiking cycle. Although activity is slower than we'd like, it's still a good environment for us as we believe it favors private capital managers with broad and deep sourcing capabilities scaled and flexible capital, significant relationships and well-known brands. In fact, our deployment picked up notably versus the first quarter, and our pipelines are generally higher compared to 3 months ago. As I'll discuss a little later in more detail, portfolio fundamentals are positive and stable. Credit quality across our debt portfolio continues to be above historical averages and we're seeing continued solid cash flow growth across our corporate credit, private equity and real estate portfolios. During the second quarter, our business continued to deliver strong and consistent growth with management fees, fee-related earnings and after-tax realized income all around 20% or better on a year-over-year basis. Our strong fundraising momentum continued with over $17 billion raised in the second quarter, and we continue to see very strong follow-on demand from our existing clients. Our private credit strategies continued to drive our growth as investors consolidate capital with scaled credit managers and recognize the attractiveness of the market opportunity, our competitive advantages and our long-standing successful track record. In Q2, we raised an additional $3.9 billion for our sixth European Direct Lending fund, bringing the total initial closing to $8.6 billion. We expect several large subsequent closings over the next several months with the final closing likely held in early 2024. We continue to expect that the size of this fund will exceed that of the prior vintage. In Q2, we also raised an additional $1.8 billion for our second alternative credit fund, bringing the total initial closing to $3.5 billion at quarter end. We're currently at $4.4 billion and in the next few weeks, we expect commitments will exceed the fund's initial $5 billion target. We expect the final close within the next 3 months to be oversubscribed at our hard cap of $6.5 billion. Other notable fundraising highlights in the second quarter included a partial first close through our second climate infrastructure equity fund of nearly $500 million and additional real estate fund closings of $1.5 billion, including nearly $500 million in our real estate debt funds and $600 million in U.S. opportunistic real estate equity strategies, including co-investments. We continue to see strong institutional demand for real estate debt due to the general risk-off sentiment in the banking sector and the outsized return opportunities to inject capital at conservative levels with reset valuations. In addition to the subsequent closings in alternative credit and European direct lending, we've had some additional significant fundraising here in the third quarter as well. Last Friday, we held the first close of our third U.S. senior direct lending fund, in the aggregate, we received $5.1 billion of commitments from investors and including anticipated fund-level leverage which would close gradually in the coming quarters as needed, this translates to a total expected investable capital base of more than $8.5 billion. Based on our current subscriptions and the existing investor pipeline, we anticipate the total fund size will be well in excess of the previous vintage, which raised $8 billion in equity commitments and approximately $14 billion in total investable capital. So all told, as of the date of this call, we've raised approximately $7.3 billion of capital thus far in the third quarter on top of the more than $31 billion raised in the first half of the year. Let me now provide an update on our efforts in the strategically important wealth management and insurance channels. We raised over $300 million across the 2 nontraded REITs in Q2, and we continue to be net positive on inflows for the quarter, including capital raised through our 1031 Exchange solutions. We recently added a third wirehouse for our diversified REIT as well as a global private bank for both REITs. Our recently launched nontraded BDC, ASF was added to a wire house late in Q2 and early this month, we expect initial inflows of approximately $175 million from the wealth management channel alongside expected additional capital from several new institutional investors into that product. We have ambitious global product expansion plans, and we've made the investments in personnel and infrastructure to launch certain credit products into the European and APAC wealth management markets later this year and into next year. We also formally launched Access Ares, a comprehensive online platform that offers product agnostic and educational content and thought leadership for the wealth channel. Within our affiliated insurance segment through Aspida, we saw $2 billion of new annuity premium inflows from both our retail and reinsurance platforms in the second quarter. In the first half of 2023, Aspida has issued $3.6 billion in annuity premiums and has grown to approximately $9.5 billion in AUM. We continue to see significant demand for annuities allowing us to generate attractive spread opportunities. Management fees have nearly tripled over the past year, and the business continues to gain notable operational efficiencies as it scales. For 2023, we remain on track to be notably above our $57 billion fundraising total from last year. We have about 30 different funds in the market. And in addition to the progress and updates I outlined earlier, in the second half of the year, we expect closings in our inaugural credit secondaries fund. Our third infrastructure secondaries fund, our seventh Corporate Opportunities Fund along with additions from smaller funds, perpetual capital vehicles, managed accounts and CLOs. Looking forward, over the next several quarters and depending on the pace of deployment, we would expect to launch a number of our largest closed-end commingled fund series, including our third U.S. junior debt fund, our third special opportunities fund and our fourth European value-add real estate equity fund. With respect to our investing activities, we deployed more than $15 billion in the second quarter, a 17% increase versus a seasonally slow first quarter, led by our leading private credit strategies particularly in U.S. direct lending and alternative credit. Private credit is clearly taking a larger share of the market, and we believe that we're participating in that trend when we look at our deployment versus the market. We continue to see strong demand for our private credit solutions as our brand and reputation provide advantages in winning new transaction mandates. In an environment where new M&A volumes are light, our incumbency across thousands of borrowers is a significant benefit in driving origination activity. Deployment for our alternative credit group has been particularly strong and we anticipate deployment in this strategy to remain at elevated levels in the near future. With its focus on asset-backed investments and significant capital available for deployment, Alternative credit is well positioned to partner with regional banks and to provide attractive solutions for both investors and the regional banks. For example, in June, our alternative credit funds acquired PacWest lender finance portfolio, which totaled $3.5 billion of commitments and $2.1 billion in funded investments. Our alternative credit group continues to benefit from its large scale, deep team and strong track record. With approximately $28 billion in AUM and nearly 65 investment professionals in our alternative credit group, we believe that we are the largest player in the private credit segment of asset-backed finance, and this scale advantage enables us to transact with size and flexibility that is not easy to replicate. In European Direct Lending, quarterly deployment was a little softer as certain large transactions slipped and closed early in the third quarter. This bodes well for the third quarter and the pipeline has picked up considerably. Due to weaker competition from banks and certain private credit managers, we're seeing significant relative value opportunities in high-quality companies with attractive pricing terms and structures. In real estate, while we remain very selective and volumes remain slow, we're finding interesting opportunities, particularly in real estate debt and across the platform in sectors where we have differentiated sourcing and operating capabilities. Turning to portfolio quality. Across our more than 1,700 portfolio companies firm-wide, we continue to see strong fundamentals. Credit quality remains remarkably resilient despite the historic increase in market interest rates and certain inflationary pressures. In Ares Capital Corporation, which is a good barometer for the overall U.S. direct lending business, Non-accruals declined slightly in the second quarter, and they remain well below 15-year historical averages, and the pace of amendments in the portfolio remain at stable levels. Across the U.S. direct lending portfolio, EBITDA growth remains in the high single digits over the most recent reporting period and were invested at a weighted average loan-to-value of 42%. Our loan-to-value has meaningfully improved from where we and the markets were 10 to 15 years ago as private equity sponsors have been contributing significantly greater amounts of equity capital to fund transactions, which reduces our risk. In Europe, our portfolio performance is similar with 10% EBITDA growth across our direct lending portfolio and limited non-accruals, while we continue to benefit from higher floating rates. Our global real estate portfolio also continues to perform well, supported by our significant weighting in the market's best performing sectors of industrial and multifamily which collectively account for 75% of our global real estate portfolio's gross assets with another 13% invested in our favorite alternative sectors, including self-storage, triple net lease and single-family rental. While higher cap rates have negatively impacted valuations and we're seeing some decelerating rent growth aggregate fundamentals remain positive in the portfolio with growing cash flows, limited vacancies and continued demand for our properties. In our 2 largest segments, we're seeing comparable rent growth of 8.5% year-over-year in multifamily and same-store rent growth in industrial remained above 70% over the last 12 months. Our private equity portfolio generated strong returns in the quarter, primarily related to continued EBITDA growth and partially due to the successful IPO of Sabre's Value Village which is a meaningful position in certain ACOF and ASOF funds. Across the portfolio, EBITDA grew 11% year-over-year, while valuation multiples generally remained flat quarter-over-quarter. So overall, we continue to see strong fundamental performance across our portfolio, strong fundraising demand, particularly in private credit and interesting deployment opportunities across our investment groups. And before I hand the call over to Jarrod, I'd like to touch on our recently announced financially and strategically accretive acquisition of Crescent Point Capital. Crescent Point is a leading Asia-focused private equity firm with $3.8 billion in assets under management and a team and platform that we've been courting for several years. With Crescent Point, we believe that we have an excellent team with deep market insights, a strong track record and most importantly, a great cultural fit into our platform. This transaction, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter adds to our significant presence in the Asia Pacific region, including 50 additional investment professionals, and we now have direct sourcing capabilities across credit, private equity and real assets through our Ares Asia platform. We view the Asia Pacific region as a significant future growth area for us, and this acquisition helps expand the breadth of our products in the region. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Jarrod for comments on our financial results. Jarrod?\nJarrod Phillips: Thanks, Mike. Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. This quarter, we continued to experience strong growth in our financial metrics, including management fees, fee-related earnings, realized income, AUM and FPAUM compared to the second quarter of 2022. Our FRE rich business model continues to deliver consistent 20%-plus growth despite the significant market volatility we've experienced over the past year. Net realized performance income also increased 50% year-over-year, driven by a pickup in realizations from our European waterfall funds, leading to a 26% increase in realized income year-over-year. Our fundraising strength was highlighted again in the second quarter as investors continue to entrust us with more capital, due to our ability to consistently invest in attractive assets and deliver strong performance throughout market cycles. We ended the second quarter with $378 billion of AUM, and we're on track to meet or exceed our target of $500 billion and more by 2025. With $96 billion of available capital and several large fundraisers ahead of us, we have a great line of sight on our FRE growth and operating margin efficiencies for the next few years. From a revenue perspective, our management fees totaled over $621 million in the quarter, an increase of 18% compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by deployment of our available capital in our credit group. Other fee income of approximately $30 million was up 35% from the second quarter of 2022, driven by structuring fees and infrastructure debt, additional structuring fees and direct lending as well as capital market advisory fees at our broker-dealer, which was recently licensed to participate more broadly in capital market transactions that may provide an additional revenue source for us prospectively. FRE totaled $266 million, an increase of 21% from the second quarter of 2022, driven by higher management fees from deployment over the last 12 months, as well as a slower pace of hiring in the first half of 2023. In a market environment that continues to be characterized by volatility and lower transaction volume. Our ability to demonstrate consistent strong growth in management fees and FRE is a significant differentiator for Ares. We remain confident in our ability to maintain 20% or better FRE growth annually through 2025. Excluding the FRPR from the non-traded REITs as we discussed on our call in February. Our FRE margin in the second quarter was 40.8%, roughly a 70 basis point improvement from the 40.1% in the second quarter of last year and a slight improvement from the first quarter of 2023. We expect to see margin expansion occurring in the back half of 2023 and continuing in 2024 and 2025. Deployment speed will ultimately dictate the pace of margin expansion, but we remain confident that our stable growing management fee model will enable us to reach the 45% plus run rate FRE margin target by the end of 2025 that we guided to 2 years ago. As it relates to FRPR this year, we continue to expect approximately 95% of our FRPR to be realized in the fourth quarter of the year. Currently, the potential FRPR from our credit funds is tracking well ahead of last year's. We're experiencing the benefits of a higher interest rate environment, while seeing some modest tightening in the spreads. This forecast is still subject to the total return performance of the strategies for the full year, including changes in market values. Regarding the FRP from our real estate group, as of June 30 the 2 nontraded REITs had not accrued any incentive fees on their balance sheets. Our realization activity picked up in the second quarter after a slow start to the year. Our more stable and predictable net realized performance income from European waterfall style funds totaled $30 million in the second quarter, modestly above the expectations we outlined on last quarter's call. In addition, we had realizations in our private equity group and American style funds totaling $9 million of net realized performance income and another $3 million net from crystallized incentive fees from alternative credit funds. In total, we recognized $42 million in realized net performance income, a 59% increase from the second quarter of 2022. As we discussed on our first quarter call, we do expect some lumpiness in our European waterfall realizations throughout this year and next year before we begin generating more consistent performance revenue. For the remainder of this year, we expect over 90% of our remaining European waterfall realizations to be recognized in the fourth quarter. For 2024, we remain confident in our expectation of $175 million in European waterfall realizations with potential upside. Even with the higher realizations, our net accrued performance receivables grew to $960 million, up 8.8% versus the first quarter and up more than 15% year-to-date. Notably, approximately $55 million of this increase comes from our credit funds. Where we're seeing the benefits of higher interest rates compounding above our fixed or rates, along with the credit -- solid credit fundamentals as Mike described earlier. Unlike equity style funds, where increases in performance fees are based on capital appreciation, driven by market multiples and EBITDA growth. Credit funds generate consistent predictable growth in accrued performance fee income when the underlying assets generate yields above fixed hurdle rates, assuming stable credit fundamentals. This difference is one of the reasons we believe our European waterfall style funds are more predictable and a clear differentiator for Ares. Of the $960 million of net accrued performance receivables, $670 million or nearly 70% were in European style waterfall funds, of which $371 million is from funds that are past their reinvestment periods. We now have $115 billion or over 50% of our incentive eligible AUM and European-style waterfall farms. We expect this balance will continue to grow as we raise additional capital in several of our largest funds, including our sixth European direct lending fund, our third senior direct lending fund, our second alternative credit fund and others. Realized income in the second quarter totaled $312 million, up 26% from the year ago period. After-tax realized income per share of Class A common stock was $0.90, 22% higher than the level of the second quarter of 2022. As Carl mentioned, we declared a dividend in the third quarter of $0.77 per share of Class A and non-voting common stock, up 26% year-over-year, and we remain on track with our objective of providing 20% annual growth in our dividends for the next 2 years. As of June 30, our AUM totaled $378 billion, and our fee-paying AUM totaled $242 billion. We continue to grow our AUM not yet paying fees available for future deployment as our fundraising and outpaced our deployment. This amount now stands at $55.6 billion at quarter end and has increased 33% from the beginning of the year. This represents over $550 million in potential incremental future management fees. Regarding fund performance, we generated attractive performance across each of our credit strategies, which generated quarterly gross returns ranging from 2% to over 10%, and our primary credit strategy composites, in private equity, both of our core investment strategies generated strong relative returns for both the second quarter and last 12 months. Our special opportunities composite generated gross returns of 8.1% in the second quarter and 20.6% over the last 12 months. Our corporate private equity composite generated gross returns of 5.5% in the quarter and 8.3% for the last 12 months. Within real estate, our U.S. real estate equity composite gross return was up 4.1% in the second quarter and essentially flat for the trailing 12 months as cash flow growth is largely offset by increases in cap rates. With that, I'll turn it back to Mike for closing remarks.\nMichael Arougheti: Great. Thanks, Jarrod. We believe the fundamentals of the business are very sound even in the face of economic and market uncertainty. The credit quality and fundamentals across our portfolios are showing resiliency and strength and our asset-light balance sheet and FRE based financial model have helped to insulate earnings from the significant market volatility experienced over the past year. While market transaction volumes remain slower than typical, market repayments are also slower and it's been considerably easier to protect our best assets.  We believe that we're advantaged due to our large and diverse direct sourcing capabilities that can gain share in these environments. And we believe that we're very well positioned to capitalize on the pent-up demand for transactions when the capital markets environment ultimately improves. The demand for our funds continues to be robust as we gain wallet share and add promising new clients. And this is driving a large and sharply growing amount of available capital for deployment, which provides meaningful visibility for continued earnings growth, dividend growth and margin expansion in the coming years. In short, we remain confident that our business is positioned to continue delivering strong results for both our fund investors and Ares shareholders regardless of the economic picture. As always, I'm grateful for the hard work and dedication of our teams around the globe and I appreciate our investors' continuing support for our company. Operator, I think with that, we can now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nCraig Siegenthaler: First question is how has Ares is interaction with the U.S. bank industry chain post the March crisis. And this includes -- have you been forming partnerships. And if you can quantify that, that might be helpful. And then also, which your businesses are you seeing the most deployment opportunities from the bank?\nMichael Arougheti: It's still early days in terms of the formalization of any types of structured partnerships, but I would maybe just direct your attention back to the PacWest transaction that we talked about on the prepared remarks as kind of a nice road map for how I think Ares and others like us can be a good partner to the regional banks as they transition to the new world, that we're all living in. I think we're still in the early stages of the transition in the banking market. My expectation is we'll continue to see more consolidation. With that consolidation, I think we'll see secondary asset purchase opportunities and reduced competition in the primary market. I also think the larger banks as they grapple with the new right cap, framework will look to us to partner with them where we can leverage some of their origination and balance sheet married with our capabilities and access to equity. I would say the number of conversations that we're having around these types of transactions has been increasing, and it's showing up, first and foremost in our alternative credit business, which is where we executed on the PacWest transaction. So I would expect this to be a theme for the next year or 2, not month or 2, and it's still early, but I think the pipeline is still big.\nCraig Siegenthaler: My follow-up is just on the credit quality front. And I think we all know that the economic data has been quite resilient. But have you seen a pickup in restructuring and corporate lending, just following some declines in interest coverage and also if there has been some restructuring, how easy was it to get more cash from the sponsors to help deliver the portfolio of company.\nMichael Arougheti: So the simple answer is, I would say, we have not seen a meaningful pickup. Defaults and non-accruals are still well below 15-year historical averages. Kipp talked about on the ARCC call that we've actually seen a stabilization even in modifications and amendments and the bulk of the conversations are being driven by cost of capital as opposed to fundamental underperformance. I'd highlight what we talked about in the prepared remarks that the credit portfolios are sitting in a loan-to-value in the low 40s, 42% in the U.S. There's a significant amount of equity subordination in the bulk of these capital structures in the hands of institutional equity owners of real assets and corporates that have a lot of dry powder. So in terms of willingness to support performing companies that have capital structure drops down. I'd say that we've been very happy and pleased with the support we're seeing from our clients, and I'd expect that to continue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlex Blostein: So you mentioned that your deployment pipeline is tracking higher than it was, I believe you said 3 months ago. So can you unpack that a little bit maybe across which type of strategies and the pace of deployment that you expect over the next 12 months relative to the prior 12 months? I heard you on the Alt Credit, which is obviously super interesting, given what's going on with the banks but maybe we can just broaden out the deployment opportunity a little bit more broadly.\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. It's moving around a bit, Alex. So I can't give you -- I'm not going to give you any specifics business by business. I would say, generally, even in a slow M&A environment, we're finding good deployment across the credit landscape and the opportunistic landscape to bring capital into businesses that are in need of liquidity to either play offense or defense. And as we're seeing broadly in the market, and it's true in our portfolio as well, a lot of our private equity clients are focusing inwardly on their existing portfolios. And we're seeing a fair amount of tuck-in acquisition activity and growth investment. So as a proxy, if you look at ARCC in the quarter, of the deployment in the quarter, which is high relative to our historical levels was into the portfolio. That compares with roughly 50%. So one of the benefits we have given our incumbency and the number of portfolio positions we have around the globe is that we can stay active in an environment like this even when M&A is down. We are seeing the pipeline build deals logged quarter-over-quarter, 20% quarter-over-quarter growth. I think my own view is we're going to see a pickup in transaction activity towards the back half of the year. I think there's a fair amount of pent-up demand we're now getting to the end of the hiking cycle, and I think people are going to be more willing to transact. It's always tough to answer that question in the middle of August because there's naturally a slowdown. So how people are feeling this week and next week is probably not the best proxy. But my sense is the shadow pipelines are developing. And to your point, I think alternative credit and opportunistic credit in all of its forms is probably where we're going to see the biggest growth going into the back half of the year.\nAlex Blostein: My second question is around maybe zooming out and thinking through the wealth channel dynamics that you outlined in your prepared remarks. So maybe give us a little bit of a road map of how you see ASIP evolving from here. It sounds like you guys got on one large platform last quarter. Early days, I think you said about $175 million of net inflows that you guys saw in there. But maybe how are you thinking about pace of getting on other platforms sort of time frames. And the wins that you have seen so far in that particular channel -- do you find that coming from advisers that are already familiar with the products that are investing maybe within other parts of the private credit spectrum? Or these are kind of FAs that are new to the product set?\nMichael Arougheti: So we've been very pleased with the progress in ACIS specifically and the growth in the wealth channel more broadly. Obviously, on the heels of the Black Creek acquisition and transition to Ares Wealth Management, we've been making meaningful investments in product development and distribution. So we've added our private markets fund around our PE and secondary\u2019s business. Obviously, we continue to grow the non-traded REITs. And ASOF is a real bright spot building off of our traded BDC track record. I'd remind you that we seeded that fund with a meaningful institutional commitment earlier in the year. And so the number of the $175 million coming out of wealth was just the initial inflow that we saw here in the back half of this quarter as we began to distribute. So that's actually a pretty strong number and gives me cause for optimism. My expectation is that we will begin to add new partners around the globe in the fourth quarter of this year. And then my expectation is we'll probably add another U.S. wire in Q1 of 2024 to continue the distribution of that product. In terms of the adviser behavior, it's hard to say. I mean we obviously have a strong brand through the BDC and the non-traded REITs and the mortgage REIT that -- I think the brand is pretty well developed -- my sense is that those that are investing in ACAS are probably invested somewhere else with Ares as kind of the initial uptake. But I think given our brand and track record across the BDC and private credit market that I think we'll see deeper penetration as the product rolls out.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Budish with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBenjamin Budish: Maybe first on the acquisition Crescent Point. Can you maybe talk about what this business does, besides kind of the high level set you mentioned earlier, what it sort of adds to the picture, are there cross-selling opportunities? Are there more informational advantages more distribution. How do you see it sort of fitting into the existing Asia business and maybe contributing to growth there?\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. As we've articulated, on prior calls, our goal over time is to have our Ares Asia business look a lot like our U.S. and European business, meaning representation from each of the asset classes across the entire geography. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, what this acquisition does by filling in the private equity sleeve now has us able to originate and invest in private credit, private equity real assets and secondaries given the existing capabilities that we have. Telling you what you probably know, those markets are still less mature, less evolved from a private standpoint. And so while we have expectations for meaningful growth, those markets need to continue to develop in order for us to see the type of scale in these markets that we have here. So I think that's more of a decade type trend than a couple of quarters, but all of the pieces are in place. What this business does for us is, it gives us a meaningful equity capability, particularly in geographies where we can create synergy with our debt platform, notably in China, Southeast Asia and India, which are very interesting markets, India probably top of the list right now. What is addressing about that market, and it's not that it's dissimilar to what we're seeing in other parts of the world. But given the stage of development in those markets. I think the lines between debt and equity and debt and structured equity are fundamentally blurrier in that part of the world. And so adding sourcing and investment capabilities deeper down the balance sheet to marry with our opportunistic credit. I think we'll actually have a pretty meaningful sourcing synergy emerge. So pretty excited about it and hope to expect to see it close next quarter.\nBenjamin Budish: Maybe just one more for Jarrod. You mentioned in the prepared remarks that there's potential upside to the realizations from the European waterfall opportunity. Is there any way to kind of give that any context or any way to size that? Is it sort of a matter of the rate curve has kind of gone up since we've at spoken and that leads to incremental upside from the floating rate debt? Or any other kind of color you can give to help us think about what that might look like.\nJarrod Phillips: And it's a lot of what you just outlined there that as the rate increases, we see those rates reset and against the fixed hurdle rate that allows accrue more over time. I kind of remind you the guidance that we gave for this year, we really expect to see -- we're still in that early stage of these European waterfalls. So we expect to see it more centered around the fourth quarter and then moving into 2024 is where we see that upside, and that upside is driven by those increased rates, maybe a little bit of an extended duration on these assets and then them paying off or then entering into their full European waterfall during 2024. So that's a lot of what's driving the upside. And you can really see where that's manifesting itself in the accrued net performance fees on the balance sheet and that's gone up year-to-date.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian McKenna with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Mckenna: So just drilling into performance a bit here. You had a few strategies that really outperformed during the quarter, including alternative credit, which was up nearly 7%, Asia credit increased north of 12% and then special opportunities was up about 8%. So could you just talk about some of the underlying trends for these strategies. Specifically, what drove the outperformance? And then what's the outlook for all these in the back half of the year?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. I think hopefully, it's pretty self-explanatory. I mean if you -- the bulk of what those strategies are focusing on is opportunistic credit investing largely with floating rate instruments. So I think you're getting twofold impact. One is just the benefit of increased coupon as rates go up. And two, if you think about the flexibility of those strategies, for example, Asia being a special sit strategy, ASOF having the ability to invest in rescue capital and special situation that's very thematic and on trend in terms of the need for capital. Given what's going on in the market in terms of the supply-demand imbalance of liquidity, denominator effect and people's need to make their equity capital bases last longer. I would expect that trend to continue and you called those out, but I would also highlight that if you look at some of the regular way credit strategies, U.S. direct lending, for example, put up a 5% composite return in the quarter, which is pretty -- pretty significant as well. So I think it's a combination of right product for the market and increasing base rates.\nBrian Mckenna: And then just a follow-up on the FRE margin. When you look across the businesses, the margin within credit is in the mid-60s. While most of the other segments have margins in the low 50% range. So I guess, is there any opportunity to increase the margin in some of these other businesses? And if so, where could they expand to over time?\nJarrod Phillips: I think it's really a simple answer Go ahead, Mike.\nMichael Arougheti: Go ahead, Jarrod. Go ahead.\nJarrod Phillips: Yes. No, I was going to say it's really all in line with the 45% guidance that we've laid out. As we've built out our credit business over time, certainly become the largest business probably the most at scale. A lot of it is using the platform to continue to build that scale. It's deployment of the assets on that and subsequent fundraising being larger than the prior vintages. As that deployment and those fundraisings occur, that's what really provides the tailwinds and uplift the margins. So when we talk about our 45% plus run rate at the end of 2025, it's really coming on the backs of, like you said, the expansion of margin in a lot of those areas is we still believe that there's a lot of growth across the platform, in the different areas that we invest in. And you can see that manifesting itself in that expansion of margin and the increase in revenues as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick David with Autonomous Research.\nPatrick David: It sounds like there's a much better quarter-over-quarter trend happening in European direct lending pipelines versus the U.S. So through that lens, do you have any indications that this could be the beginning of a longer-term step change in direct lending market share growth there, potentially catching up with the U.S.? Or is there more of an idiosyncratic blip happening for some reason?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, there's nothing idiosyncratic. I mean it's interesting. Our market position in Europe, as crazy as this may sound, is probably stronger than our position here in the U.S. We were effectively first in that market and have created a size and scale advantage that very few people, I think, have come close to. So some of that is timing, as we mentioned, of some deals, meaningful deals slipping quarter-over-quarter, but I would just highlight, I think our European direct lending franchise, as indicated just by the success and speed of this most recent fund, I think, is pretty unique. If you look at the growth and ultimate size of that business relative to the U.S., it has been catching up. Similar to what I just said about the APAC region. Europe was fairly well behind the U.S. market in terms of its development, and we've seen it grow to track the U.S. growth over the last 10 to 15 years. And as the market develops more, I could see us taking even more share, but that's a pretty significant market position we have there, and I think it's going to continue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Beatty with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Beatty: I just wanted to ask about private credit pricing and cost of funds kind of from the borrower perspective. Just wondering, given the elevated level of rates, whether you're seeing issuers maybe either hesitate or react differently just to the cost of funds, there's -- despite the economic resilience that you noted, there is still some cohort out there that believes we might get a pivot or a rate cut sometime in '24. So just wondering, our folks, obviously, those with financial flexibility, maybe holding off for that or otherwise differentially reacting to pricing these days?\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. Obviously, the transaction volumes being slow, I think, is largely driven by a rapid change in the cost of capital. Obviously, to the extent that you put a capital stack in place with an expectation of a 4% cost of funds, and that's now a 10% cost of funds, that's going to meaningfully hamper your financial flexibility. And on new deals, whether it's real assets or corporates, obviously, you have to now look at the cap rate and valuation environment and the cost of capital. And what that's really done is for those that want to transact, it's created lower leverage and the need to put more equity. And so if you look at equity contributions in the market today, they're approaching 57%, which is a huge level relative to historical standards. And so for those that want to transact, they're bridging it with equity.  The one thing I would highlight about the private credit asset classes, it's obviously floating rate. It's painful on the up, but it obviously can give you some relief on the way down. And while we tend to have modest call protection structured into a lot of our investments, I think for those that want to play offense there's a willingness to accept a higher cost of capital given the flexibility to prepay and to benefit from rates as they come down. And that's why I think once we get to this agreement that the hiking cycle is over and everybody can underwrite what their cost of capital is you should see you should see deal flow pick up.\nAdam Beatty: And then just turning to some of the realized carry, maybe away from the European waterfall structure, you saw a pickup in that. And just wondering to what extent maybe that suggests some loosening of the market there, what the outlook might be for Ares in the short to medium term around sort of American style realized carry, particularly in private equity.\nMichael Arougheti: Jarrod, do you want to handle that one?\nJarrod Phillips: Yes. No, absolutely. Look, I think what we had in, in our private equity group this quarter, we did have some sales of some public positions that we had had in the portfolio for a while. So there was some additional selling of those assets. Overall, we are extremely excited in the private equity portfolio to have the Savers Value Village IPO that happens towards the back half of the year. But that didn't back half of the quarter. That didn't result in any monetizations as it was a primary offering, but it was great to see that IPO and that IPO will be so successful. Otherwise, we continue to look at the markets and look for opportunities. There are opportunities for accretive sales and when they happen, we'll look to take advantage of that. But I wouldn't say that there's been a huge turn and that there's a lot of monetization on the forefront. It's being opportunistic and intelligent with what we're looking at and taking advantage of opportunities as they come.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Cyprys: If we look across the industry, broadly losses and credit seem to be a lot lighter than many would have expected despite 500 basis points plus increase in base rates, but we have seen a deterioration in discoverage. So just curious your views around that, how do you expect defaults and losses to trend as you look out the next 12 to 24 months? And maybe you can just remind us on what portion of the credit portfolio companies have hedged out their interest rate risk, how that's evolved? And how do you think the timing for those hedges to roll off?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. So as I mentioned earlier, the credit performance continues to be below historical averages. I think as we get to later cycle and we have the lag effects of the rate increases, you will naturally see defaults tick up, but I don't think that they will get to the levels that we've seen in prior crisis. You've seen interest coverage levels stabilize. And I think what is different this go around, if there's a big thing to highlight again is the amount of equity subordination and equity dry powder that exists in the market is fundamentally different than we've had in prior cycles. So my own expectation is a lot of these companies that are either seeing slowing growth or deteriorating performance with challenges on the coverage side that the resolution will largely come through transfer value from the equity to the debt as opposed to losses given a spike in defaults. That's generally what we saw through COVID. It's generally what we've seen in the early behavior in this cycle, and I would expect that to continue. So defaults will go up, but that is not cause for concern I actually think that it could result in higher rates of return across the private credit landscape as there's a transfer of value from the equity to the debt in order to bridge to a lower rate environment.\nMichael Cyprys: And then just on the interest rate hedges. Just curious any color around that.\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. It's been running around 30% on the private side. But I would say that, that's not really a panacea just in terms of the rolling structure of those hedges. So I think early in the rate cycle, that was a little bit more of a benefit than I think where we are today.\nMichael Cyprys: And just a follow-up question, if I could. On Crescent Point, I believe you guys had taken a minority or excuse me, Blue Cove. I wanted to ask on that one. You guys took a minority stake in Blue Cove in the quarter. that's, I think, a systematic credit shop. I'm just hoping you might be able to talk a little bit about the strategic rationale behind the minority stake, how you think about their capabilities and how that might be additive to your platform and your clients?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, it's still early. They are a scientific fixed income manager. So they're applying technology and quantitative tools to the management of fixed income largely on the high-grade side in this evolving world of technology, both in terms of innovation opportunity for growth and disruption, we felt that it was important for us to understand what that technology was and what opportunities it could create for us for our traditional liquid credit business.  They're great partners. They have a very strong track record of business building from their time at Blue Bay. And time will tell in terms of what that market develops into. But the investment thesis for us is that the world of scientific fixed income management, particularly around the high-grade part of the world will continue to grow. And I think that they are one of the leaders and real innovators in that part of the market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Finian O'Shea with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nFinian O\u2019Shea: Another on alternative credit and the market opportunity from banks pulling back, to what extent do you acquire those new borrower relationships and how durable are they say in comparison to what you've seen in corporate credit.\nMichael Arougheti: It's a great question, Fin. I think they're quite durable. If you just take, for example, the PacWest transaction, they were close to 90 individual borrower platforms within that lender finance book, if my memory serves me correctly. And while it's a discrete loan book, those are platforms that are originating new assets and we'll have new financing requirements and needs over time. So there is an element to this transition of the assets that should grow our client base. The other thing, as I mentioned earlier, that we are mindful of because we want to be good partners to our bank partners is that what -- I think they're all going to be focused on is how do I maintain my relevance with my client based on the capital that I have? And how do I partner with friendly capital providers like Ares in order to support that client in the most effective way. And so I don't think that every one of these transactions is about clients wholesale leaving a bank and coming to Ares. I think it's more about how can we work together to support that client over time. And at least in the early days, that's generally how we're experiencing it.\nFinian O\u2019Shea: And then just a small follow-up. Noticed a small jump on the insurance investment on the balance sheet. Can you touch on that and if it relates to any change in strategy there?\nMichael Arougheti: No, there's no change to\nJarrod Phillips: We're saying the same thing, Mike. No, it doesn't relate to a change in [Indiscernible] strategy. It's just the timing in us taking a look at what there is in the insurance business and how best to support it and its growth. Our overall goals remain the same, to ultimately be around less than 20% owner of Aspida as we grow it. But at a time when it's an extremely attractive product in the marketplace, we want to make sure that we're able to support it as best we can, and sometimes that's using our balance sheet capital.\nMichael Arougheti: I'd also highlight, too, that's reflective of an increase in the value of that investment given the underlying performance of the platform.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Brooks: I think we've danced around this for a couple of prior questions, but on the bank partnering opportunity, with a focus more on the direct lending side than the alt credit side, A couple of questions here. First, have there been any changes to the direct lending markets in the aftermath of the collapse of some of the mid-cap banks that -- changes that may persist? Second, has Ares seen opportunities to pursue business in direct lending that might have logically resided within some of the collapsed or weakened banks? And then ultimately, do you see the bigger longer-term opportunity in terms of partnering with the banks within all credit or direct lending. Like where does this ultimately fit in over time within in Ares?\nJarrod Phillips: Sure. So in terms of the direct lending business, I wouldn't say that there's been a meaningful uptick in business as a result of some of the regional bank challenges. A lot of those balance sheet, if you look at them, are largely going to be around small business, consumer and commercial real estate lending. So if we're talking about the regional banks, I would imagine that the bulk of the primary market opportunity that gets created for us is going to be in and around the commercial real estate lending and commercial real estate opportunistic equity side of our platform. That said, I would expect that with consolidation, we'll see some loan portfolios free up that could be interesting for us. The broader opportunity is going to be also in the larger banks as they wrestle with increased regulatory capital requirements. And I think that is largely going to be a story for alternative credit. You'll see, again, opportunities for partnership. I think you'll see certain banks exiting certain businesses where they've maybe been overexposed or over-indexed but look to maintain market share and client relationships, and I think we can be a good capital partner there. So I think alternative credit, at least vis-a-vis the larger banks will be a disproportionate beneficiary. And then with regard to direct lending, there's obviously been a trend in place for the last number of years that larger transactions are finding their way into the private market and out of the loan and high-yield market. that gets more and more pronounced in difficult market environments. So the current environment we're in is no exception. If you look at buyout activity, 85% of leverage buyout financing activity happened in the private markets this quarter, and I think last quarter as well. And so this theme of private markets offering value to issuers when the loan and high-yield market are challenged. I think we'll continue, and we saw that in full display in the first half of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rufus Hone with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nRufus Hone: I was hoping to get your thoughts around the potential for higher capital markets fees now that you can participate in transaction fees to a greater extent. I don't know if you'd be able to lay out any early ambitions that you might have around that and how quickly those fees could start to build?\nMichael Arougheti: I would say they will be modest contributors over time as you began to see play out in this quarter. I would highlight, though, that unlike some of our peers, a lot of those distribution type fees are actually finding their way into our underlying funds and driving higher IRRs at the product level. And so while we do have certain strategies where we're obviously sharing in origination and distribution fees with our clients, we made the determination early on in the development of Ares that those fees were for the benefit of our investors and really driving higher relative return. Which I think maybe is one of the reasons why we're enjoying such comparative success on the fundraising side. So I think you'll see it scale over time, but I don't think that it will become an overwhelmingly large number just based on the structure of the business today.\nOperator: And we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. Therefore, I will hand it back over to management for closing remarks.\nMichael Arougheti: Great. We had nothing further. We thank you for your time today and your continued support. We hope you enjoy the rest of the summer, and we'll look forward to catching up again next quarter. Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jarrod Phillips",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. This quarter, we continued to experience strong growth in our financial metrics, including management fees, fee-related earnings, realized income, AUM and FPAUM compared to the second quarter of 2022. Our FRE rich business model continues to deliver consistent 20%-plus growth despite the significant market volatility we've experienced over the past year. Net realized performance income also increased 50% year-over-year, driven by a pickup in realizations from our European waterfall funds, leading to a 26% increase in realized income year-over-year. Our fundraising strength was highlighted again in the second quarter as investors continue to entrust us with more capital, due to our ability to consistently invest in attractive assets and deliver strong performance throughout market cycles. We ended the second quarter with $378 billion of AUM, and we're on track to meet or exceed our target of $500 billion and more by 2025. With $96 billion of available capital and several large fundraisers ahead of us, we have a great line of sight on our FRE growth and operating margin efficiencies for the next few years. From a revenue perspective, our management fees totaled over $621 million in the quarter, an increase of 18% compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by deployment of our available capital in our credit group. Other fee income of approximately $30 million was up 35% from the second quarter of 2022, driven by structuring fees and infrastructure debt, additional structuring fees and direct lending as well as capital market advisory fees at our broker-dealer, which was recently licensed to participate more broadly in capital market transactions that may provide an additional revenue source for us prospectively. FRE totaled $266 million, an increase of 21% from the second quarter of 2022, driven by higher management fees from deployment over the last 12 months, as well as a slower pace of hiring in the first half of 2023. In a market environment that continues to be characterized by volatility and lower transaction volume. Our ability to demonstrate consistent strong growth in management fees and FRE is a significant differentiator for Ares. We remain confident in our ability to maintain 20% or better FRE growth annually through 2025. Excluding the FRPR from the non-traded REITs as we discussed on our call in February. Our FRE margin in the second quarter was 40.8%, roughly a 70 basis point improvement from the 40.1% in the second quarter of last year and a slight improvement from the first quarter of 2023. We expect to see margin expansion occurring in the back half of 2023 and continuing in 2024 and 2025. Deployment speed will ultimately dictate the pace of margin expansion, but we remain confident that our stable growing management fee model will enable us to reach the 45% plus run rate FRE margin target by the end of 2025 that we guided to 2 years ago. As it relates to FRPR this year, we continue to expect approximately 95% of our FRPR to be realized in the fourth quarter of the year. Currently, the potential FRPR from our credit funds is tracking well ahead of last year's. We're experiencing the benefits of a higher interest rate environment, while seeing some modest tightening in the spreads. This forecast is still subject to the total return performance of the strategies for the full year, including changes in market values. Regarding the FRP from our real estate group, as of June 30 the 2 nontraded REITs had not accrued any incentive fees on their balance sheets. Our realization activity picked up in the second quarter after a slow start to the year. Our more stable and predictable net realized performance income from European waterfall style funds totaled $30 million in the second quarter, modestly above the expectations we outlined on last quarter's call. In addition, we had realizations in our private equity group and American style funds totaling $9 million of net realized performance income and another $3 million net from crystallized incentive fees from alternative credit funds. In total, we recognized $42 million in realized net performance income, a 59% increase from the second quarter of 2022. As we discussed on our first quarter call, we do expect some lumpiness in our European waterfall realizations throughout this year and next year before we begin generating more consistent performance revenue. For the remainder of this year, we expect over 90% of our remaining European waterfall realizations to be recognized in the fourth quarter. For 2024, we remain confident in our expectation of $175 million in European waterfall realizations with potential upside. Even with the higher realizations, our net accrued performance receivables grew to $960 million, up 8.8% versus the first quarter and up more than 15% year-to-date. Notably, approximately $55 million of this increase comes from our credit funds. Where we're seeing the benefits of higher interest rates compounding above our fixed or rates, along with the credit -- solid credit fundamentals as Mike described earlier. Unlike equity style funds, where increases in performance fees are based on capital appreciation, driven by market multiples and EBITDA growth. Credit funds generate consistent predictable growth in accrued performance fee income when the underlying assets generate yields above fixed hurdle rates, assuming stable credit fundamentals. This difference is one of the reasons we believe our European waterfall style funds are more predictable and a clear differentiator for Ares. Of the $960 million of net accrued performance receivables, $670 million or nearly 70% were in European style waterfall funds, of which $371 million is from funds that are past their reinvestment periods. We now have $115 billion or over 50% of our incentive eligible AUM and European-style waterfall farms. We expect this balance will continue to grow as we raise additional capital in several of our largest funds, including our sixth European direct lending fund, our third senior direct lending fund, our second alternative credit fund and others. Realized income in the second quarter totaled $312 million, up 26% from the year ago period. After-tax realized income per share of Class A common stock was $0.90, 22% higher than the level of the second quarter of 2022. As Carl mentioned, we declared a dividend in the third quarter of $0.77 per share of Class A and non-voting common stock, up 26% year-over-year, and we remain on track with our objective of providing 20% annual growth in our dividends for the next 2 years. As of June 30, our AUM totaled $378 billion, and our fee-paying AUM totaled $242 billion. We continue to grow our AUM not yet paying fees available for future deployment as our fundraising and outpaced our deployment. This amount now stands at $55.6 billion at quarter end and has increased 33% from the beginning of the year. This represents over $550 million in potential incremental future management fees. Regarding fund performance, we generated attractive performance across each of our credit strategies, which generated quarterly gross returns ranging from 2% to over 10%, and our primary credit strategy composites, in private equity, both of our core investment strategies generated strong relative returns for both the second quarter and last 12 months. Our special opportunities composite generated gross returns of 8.1% in the second quarter and 20.6% over the last 12 months. Our corporate private equity composite generated gross returns of 5.5% in the quarter and 8.3% for the last 12 months. Within real estate, our U.S. real estate equity composite gross return was up 4.1% in the second quarter and essentially flat for the trailing 12 months as cash flow growth is largely offset by increases in cap rates. With that, I'll turn it back to Mike for closing remarks. And it's a lot of what you just outlined there that as the rate increases, we see those rates reset and against the fixed hurdle rate that allows accrue more over time. I kind of remind you the guidance that we gave for this year, we really expect to see -- we're still in that early stage of these European waterfalls. So we expect to see it more centered around the fourth quarter and then moving into 2024 is where we see that upside, and that upside is driven by those increased rates, maybe a little bit of an extended duration on these assets and then them paying off or then entering into their full European waterfall during 2024. So that's a lot of what's driving the upside. And you can really see where that's manifesting itself in the accrued net performance fees on the balance sheet and that's gone up year-to-date. I think it's really a simple answer Go ahead, Mike. Yes. No, I was going to say it's really all in line with the 45% guidance that we've laid out. As we've built out our credit business over time, certainly become the largest business probably the most at scale. A lot of it is using the platform to continue to build that scale. It's deployment of the assets on that and subsequent fundraising being larger than the prior vintages. As that deployment and those fundraisings occur, that's what really provides the tailwinds and uplift the margins. So when we talk about our 45% plus run rate at the end of 2025, it's really coming on the backs of, like you said, the expansion of margin in a lot of those areas is we still believe that there's a lot of growth across the platform, in the different areas that we invest in. And you can see that manifesting itself in that expansion of margin and the increase in revenues as well. Yes. No, absolutely. Look, I think what we had in, in our private equity group this quarter, we did have some sales of some public positions that we had had in the portfolio for a while. So there was some additional selling of those assets. Overall, we are extremely excited in the private equity portfolio to have the Savers Value Village IPO that happens towards the back half of the year. But that didn't back half of the quarter. That didn't result in any monetizations as it was a primary offering, but it was great to see that IPO and that IPO will be so successful. Otherwise, we continue to look at the markets and look for opportunities. There are opportunities for accretive sales and when they happen, we'll look to take advantage of that. But I wouldn't say that there's been a huge turn and that there's a lot of monetization on the forefront. It's being opportunistic and intelligent with what we're looking at and taking advantage of opportunities as they come. We're saying the same thing, Mike. No, it doesn't relate to a change in [Indiscernible] strategy. It's just the timing in us taking a look at what there is in the insurance business and how best to support it and its growth.

But at a time when it's an extremely attractive product in the marketplace, we want to make sure that we're able to support it as best we can, and sometimes that's using our balance sheet capital. Sure. So in terms of the direct lending business, I wouldn't say that there's been a meaningful uptick in business as a result of some of the regional bank challenges. A lot of those balance sheet, if you look at them, are largely going to be around small business, consumer and commercial real estate lending. So if we're talking about the regional banks, I would imagine that the bulk of the primary market opportunity that gets created for us is going to be in and around the commercial real estate lending and commercial real estate opportunistic equity side of our platform. That said, I would expect that with consolidation, we'll see some loan portfolios free up that could be interesting for us. The broader opportunity is going to be also in the larger banks as they wrestle with increased regulatory capital requirements. And I think that is largely going to be a story for alternative credit. You'll see, again, opportunities for partnership. I think you'll see certain banks exiting certain businesses where they've maybe been overexposed or over-indexed but look to maintain market share and client relationships, and I think we can be a good capital partner there.

So the current environment we're in is no exception. If you look at buyout activity, 85% of leverage buyout financing activity happened in the private markets this quarter, and I think last quarter as well. And so this theme of private markets offering value to issuers when the loan and high-yield market are challenged. I think we'll continue, and we saw that in full display in the first half of the year."

            "name": "Michael Arougheti",
            "content": "Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon. I hope everybody is doing well. During the second quarter, the equity and credit markets generated strong investment returns as the U.S. economy remained resilient despite a rapid increase in interest rates over the past 12 months. While transaction activity remains slower than last year, it is recovering modestly as market participants gain more confidence in transacting with improved visibility to the end of the Fed hiking cycle. Although activity is slower than we'd like, it's still a good environment for us as we believe it favors private capital managers with broad and deep sourcing capabilities scaled and flexible capital, significant relationships and well-known brands. In fact, our deployment picked up notably versus the first quarter, and our pipelines are generally higher compared to 3 months ago. As I'll discuss a little later in more detail, portfolio fundamentals are positive and stable. Credit quality across our debt portfolio continues to be above historical averages and we're seeing continued solid cash flow growth across our corporate credit, private equity and real estate portfolios. During the second quarter, our business continued to deliver strong and consistent growth with management fees, fee-related earnings and after-tax realized income all around 20% or better on a year-over-year basis. Our strong fundraising momentum continued with over $17 billion raised in the second quarter, and we continue to see very strong follow-on demand from our existing clients. Our private credit strategies continued to drive our growth as investors consolidate capital with scaled credit managers and recognize the attractiveness of the market opportunity, our competitive advantages and our long-standing successful track record. In Q2, we raised an additional $3.9 billion for our sixth European Direct Lending fund, bringing the total initial closing to $8.6 billion. We expect several large subsequent closings over the next several months with the final closing likely held in early 2024. We continue to expect that the size of this fund will exceed that of the prior vintage. In Q2, we also raised an additional $1.8 billion for our second alternative credit fund, bringing the total initial closing to $3.5 billion at quarter end. We're currently at $4.4 billion and in the next few weeks, we expect commitments will exceed the fund's initial $5 billion target. We expect the final close within the next 3 months to be oversubscribed at our hard cap of $6.5 billion. Other notable fundraising highlights in the second quarter included a partial first close through our second climate infrastructure equity fund of nearly $500 million and additional real estate fund closings of $1.5 billion, including nearly $500 million in our real estate debt funds and $600 million in U.S. opportunistic real estate equity strategies, including co-investments. We continue to see strong institutional demand for real estate debt due to the general risk-off sentiment in the banking sector and the outsized return opportunities to inject capital at conservative levels with reset valuations. In addition to the subsequent closings in alternative credit and European direct lending, we've had some additional significant fundraising here in the third quarter as well. Last Friday, we held the first close of our third U.S. senior direct lending fund, in the aggregate, we received $5.1 billion of commitments from investors and including anticipated fund-level leverage which would close gradually in the coming quarters as needed, this translates to a total expected investable capital base of more than $8.5 billion. Based on our current subscriptions and the existing investor pipeline, we anticipate the total fund size will be well in excess of the previous vintage, which raised $8 billion in equity commitments and approximately $14 billion in total investable capital. So all told, as of the date of this call, we've raised approximately $7.3 billion of capital thus far in the third quarter on top of the more than $31 billion raised in the first half of the year. Let me now provide an update on our efforts in the strategically important wealth management and insurance channels. We raised over $300 million across the 2 nontraded REITs in Q2, and we continue to be net positive on inflows for the quarter, including capital raised through our 1031 Exchange solutions. We recently added a third wirehouse for our diversified REIT as well as a global private bank for both REITs. Our recently launched nontraded BDC, ASF was added to a wire house late in Q2 and early this month, we expect initial inflows of approximately $175 million from the wealth management channel alongside expected additional capital from several new institutional investors into that product. We have ambitious global product expansion plans, and we've made the investments in personnel and infrastructure to launch certain credit products into the European and APAC wealth management markets later this year and into next year. We also formally launched Access Ares, a comprehensive online platform that offers product agnostic and educational content and thought leadership for the wealth channel. Within our affiliated insurance segment through Aspida, we saw $2 billion of new annuity premium inflows from both our retail and reinsurance platforms in the second quarter. In the first half of 2023, Aspida has issued $3.6 billion in annuity premiums and has grown to approximately $9.5 billion in AUM. We continue to see significant demand for annuities allowing us to generate attractive spread opportunities. Management fees have nearly tripled over the past year, and the business continues to gain notable operational efficiencies as it scales. For 2023, we remain on track to be notably above our $57 billion fundraising total from last year. We have about 30 different funds in the market. And in addition to the progress and updates I outlined earlier, in the second half of the year, we expect closings in our inaugural credit secondaries fund. Our third infrastructure secondaries fund, our seventh Corporate Opportunities Fund along with additions from smaller funds, perpetual capital vehicles, managed accounts and CLOs. Looking forward, over the next several quarters and depending on the pace of deployment, we would expect to launch a number of our largest closed-end commingled fund series, including our third U.S. junior debt fund, our third special opportunities fund and our fourth European value-add real estate equity fund. With respect to our investing activities, we deployed more than $15 billion in the second quarter, a 17% increase versus a seasonally slow first quarter, led by our leading private credit strategies particularly in U.S. direct lending and alternative credit. Private credit is clearly taking a larger share of the market, and we believe that we're participating in that trend when we look at our deployment versus the market. We continue to see strong demand for our private credit solutions as our brand and reputation provide advantages in winning new transaction mandates. In an environment where new M&A volumes are light, our incumbency across thousands of borrowers is a significant benefit in driving origination activity. Deployment for our alternative credit group has been particularly strong and we anticipate deployment in this strategy to remain at elevated levels in the near future. With its focus on asset-backed investments and significant capital available for deployment, Alternative credit is well positioned to partner with regional banks and to provide attractive solutions for both investors and the regional banks. For example, in June, our alternative credit funds acquired PacWest lender finance portfolio, which totaled $3.5 billion of commitments and $2.1 billion in funded investments. Our alternative credit group continues to benefit from its large scale, deep team and strong track record. With approximately $28 billion in AUM and nearly 65 investment professionals in our alternative credit group, we believe that we are the largest player in the private credit segment of asset-backed finance, and this scale advantage enables us to transact with size and flexibility that is not easy to replicate. In European Direct Lending, quarterly deployment was a little softer as certain large transactions slipped and closed early in the third quarter. This bodes well for the third quarter and the pipeline has picked up considerably. Due to weaker competition from banks and certain private credit managers, we're seeing significant relative value opportunities in high-quality companies with attractive pricing terms and structures. In real estate, while we remain very selective and volumes remain slow, we're finding interesting opportunities, particularly in real estate debt and across the platform in sectors where we have differentiated sourcing and operating capabilities. Turning to portfolio quality. Across our more than 1,700 portfolio companies firm-wide, we continue to see strong fundamentals. Credit quality remains remarkably resilient despite the historic increase in market interest rates and certain inflationary pressures. In Ares Capital Corporation, which is a good barometer for the overall U.S. direct lending business, Non-accruals declined slightly in the second quarter, and they remain well below 15-year historical averages, and the pace of amendments in the portfolio remain at stable levels. Across the U.S. direct lending portfolio, EBITDA growth remains in the high single digits over the most recent reporting period and were invested at a weighted average loan-to-value of 42%. Our loan-to-value has meaningfully improved from where we and the markets were 10 to 15 years ago as private equity sponsors have been contributing significantly greater amounts of equity capital to fund transactions, which reduces our risk. In Europe, our portfolio performance is similar with 10% EBITDA growth across our direct lending portfolio and limited non-accruals, while we continue to benefit from higher floating rates. Our global real estate portfolio also continues to perform well, supported by our significant weighting in the market's best performing sectors of industrial and multifamily which collectively account for 75% of our global real estate portfolio's gross assets with another 13% invested in our favorite alternative sectors, including self-storage, triple net lease and single-family rental. While higher cap rates have negatively impacted valuations and we're seeing some decelerating rent growth aggregate fundamentals remain positive in the portfolio with growing cash flows, limited vacancies and continued demand for our properties. In our 2 largest segments, we're seeing comparable rent growth of 8.5% year-over-year in multifamily and same-store rent growth in industrial remained above 70% over the last 12 months. Our private equity portfolio generated strong returns in the quarter, primarily related to continued EBITDA growth and partially due to the successful IPO of Sabre's Value Village which is a meaningful position in certain ACOF and ASOF funds. Across the portfolio, EBITDA grew 11% year-over-year, while valuation multiples generally remained flat quarter-over-quarter. So overall, we continue to see strong fundamental performance across our portfolio, strong fundraising demand, particularly in private credit and interesting deployment opportunities across our investment groups. And before I hand the call over to Jarrod, I'd like to touch on our recently announced financially and strategically accretive acquisition of Crescent Point Capital. Crescent Point is a leading Asia-focused private equity firm with $3.8 billion in assets under management and a team and platform that we've been courting for several years. With Crescent Point, we believe that we have an excellent team with deep market insights, a strong track record and most importantly, a great cultural fit into our platform. This transaction, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter adds to our significant presence in the Asia Pacific region, including 50 additional investment professionals, and we now have direct sourcing capabilities across credit, private equity and real assets through our Ares Asia platform. We view the Asia Pacific region as a significant future growth area for us, and this acquisition helps expand the breadth of our products in the region. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Jarrod for comments on our financial results. Jarrod? Great. Thanks, Jarrod. We believe the fundamentals of the business are very sound even in the face of economic and market uncertainty. The credit quality and fundamentals across our portfolios are showing resiliency and strength and our asset-light balance sheet and FRE based financial model have helped to insulate earnings from the significant market volatility experienced over the past year. While market transaction volumes remain slower than typical, market repayments are also slower and it's been considerably easier to protect our best assets.  We believe that we're advantaged due to our large and diverse direct sourcing capabilities that can gain share in these environments. And we believe that we're very well positioned to capitalize on the pent-up demand for transactions when the capital markets environment ultimately improves. The demand for our funds continues to be robust as we gain wallet share and add promising new clients. And this is driving a large and sharply growing amount of available capital for deployment, which provides meaningful visibility for continued earnings growth, dividend growth and margin expansion in the coming years. In short, we remain confident that our business is positioned to continue delivering strong results for both our fund investors and Ares shareholders regardless of the economic picture. As always, I'm grateful for the hard work and dedication of our teams around the globe and I appreciate our investors' continuing support for our company. Operator, I think with that, we can now open up the line for questions. It's still early days in terms of the formalization of any types of structured partnerships, but I would maybe just direct your attention back to the PacWest transaction that we talked about on the prepared remarks as kind of a nice road map for how I think Ares and others like us can be a good partner to the regional banks as they transition to the new world, that we're all living in. I think we're still in the early stages of the transition in the banking market. My expectation is we'll continue to see more consolidation. With that consolidation, I think we'll see secondary asset purchase opportunities and reduced competition in the primary market. I also think the larger banks as they grapple with the new right cap, framework will look to us to partner with them where we can leverage some of their origination and balance sheet married with our capabilities and access to equity. I would say the number of conversations that we're having around these types of transactions has been increasing, and it's showing up, first and foremost in our alternative credit business, which is where we executed on the PacWest transaction. So I would expect this to be a theme for the next year or 2, not month or 2, and it's still early, but I think the pipeline is still big. So the simple answer is, I would say, we have not seen a meaningful pickup. Defaults and non-accruals are still well below 15-year historical averages. Kipp talked about on the ARCC call that we've actually seen a stabilization even in modifications and amendments and the bulk of the conversations are being driven by cost of capital as opposed to fundamental underperformance. I'd highlight what we talked about in the prepared remarks that the credit portfolios are sitting in a loan-to-value in the low 40s, 42% in the U.S. There's a significant amount of equity subordination in the bulk of these capital structures in the hands of institutional equity owners of real assets and corporates that have a lot of dry powder. So in terms of willingness to support performing companies that have capital structure drops down. I'd say that we've been very happy and pleased with the support we're seeing from our clients, and I'd expect that to continue. Yes. It's moving around a bit, Alex. So I can't give you -- I'm not going to give you any specifics business by business. I would say, generally, even in a slow M&A environment, we're finding good deployment across the credit landscape and the opportunistic landscape to bring capital into businesses that are in need of liquidity to either play offense or defense. And as we're seeing broadly in the market, and it's true in our portfolio as well, a lot of our private equity clients are focusing inwardly on their existing portfolios. And we're seeing a fair amount of tuck-in acquisition activity and growth investment. So as a proxy, if you look at ARCC in the quarter, of the deployment in the quarter, which is high relative to our historical levels was into the portfolio. That compares with roughly 50%. So one of the benefits we have given our incumbency and the number of portfolio positions we have around the globe is that we can stay active in an environment like this even when M&A is down. We are seeing the pipeline build deals logged quarter-over-quarter, 20% quarter-over-quarter growth. I think my own view is we're going to see a pickup in transaction activity towards the back half of the year. I think there's a fair amount of pent-up demand we're now getting to the end of the hiking cycle, and I think people are going to be more willing to transact. It's always tough to answer that question in the middle of August because there's naturally a slowdown. So how people are feeling this week and next week is probably not the best proxy. But my sense is the shadow pipelines are developing. And to your point, I think alternative credit and opportunistic credit in all of its forms is probably where we're going to see the biggest growth going into the back half of the year. So we've been very pleased with the progress in ACIS specifically and the growth in the wealth channel more broadly. Obviously, on the heels of the Black Creek acquisition and transition to Ares Wealth Management, we've been making meaningful investments in product development and distribution. So we've added our private markets fund around our PE and secondary\u2019s business. Obviously, we continue to grow the non-traded REITs. And ASOF is a real bright spot building off of our traded BDC track record. I'd remind you that we seeded that fund with a meaningful institutional commitment earlier in the year. And so the number of the $175 million coming out of wealth was just the initial inflow that we saw here in the back half of this quarter as we began to distribute. So that's actually a pretty strong number and gives me cause for optimism. My expectation is that we will begin to add new partners around the globe in the fourth quarter of this year. And then my expectation is we'll probably add another U.S. wire in Q1 of 2024 to continue the distribution of that product. In terms of the adviser behavior, it's hard to say. I mean we obviously have a strong brand through the BDC and the non-traded REITs and the mortgage REIT that -- I think the brand is pretty well developed -- my sense is that those that are investing in ACAS are probably invested somewhere else with Ares as kind of the initial uptake. But I think given our brand and track record across the BDC and private credit market that I think we'll see deeper penetration as the product rolls out. Sure. As we've articulated, on prior calls, our goal over time is to have our Ares Asia business look a lot like our U.S. and European business, meaning representation from each of the asset classes across the entire geography. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, what this acquisition does by filling in the private equity sleeve now has us able to originate and invest in private credit, private equity real assets and secondaries given the existing capabilities that we have. Telling you what you probably know, those markets are still less mature, less evolved from a private standpoint. And so while we have expectations for meaningful growth, those markets need to continue to develop in order for us to see the type of scale in these markets that we have here. So I think that's more of a decade type trend than a couple of quarters, but all of the pieces are in place. What this business does for us is, it gives us a meaningful equity capability, particularly in geographies where we can create synergy with our debt platform, notably in China, Southeast Asia and India, which are very interesting markets, India probably top of the list right now. What is addressing about that market, and it's not that it's dissimilar to what we're seeing in other parts of the world. But given the stage of development in those markets. I think the lines between debt and equity and debt and structured equity are fundamentally blurrier in that part of the world. And so adding sourcing and investment capabilities deeper down the balance sheet to marry with our opportunistic credit. I think we'll actually have a pretty meaningful sourcing synergy emerge. So pretty excited about it and hope to expect to see it close next quarter. Yes. I think hopefully, it's pretty self-explanatory. I mean if you -- the bulk of what those strategies are focusing on is opportunistic credit investing largely with floating rate instruments. So I think you're getting twofold impact. One is just the benefit of increased coupon as rates go up. And two, if you think about the flexibility of those strategies, for example, Asia being a special sit strategy, ASOF having the ability to invest in rescue capital and special situation that's very thematic and on trend in terms of the need for capital. Given what's going on in the market in terms of the supply-demand imbalance of liquidity, denominator effect and people's need to make their equity capital bases last longer. I would expect that trend to continue and you called those out, but I would also highlight that if you look at some of the regular way credit strategies, U.S. direct lending, for example, put up a 5% composite return in the quarter, which is pretty -- pretty significant as well. So I think it's a combination of right product for the market and increasing base rates. Go ahead, Jarrod. Go ahead. Yes, there's nothing idiosyncratic. I mean it's interesting. Our market position in Europe, as crazy as this may sound, is probably stronger than our position here in the U.S. We were effectively first in that market and have created a size and scale advantage that very few people, I think, have come close to. So some of that is timing, as we mentioned, of some deals, meaningful deals slipping quarter-over-quarter, but I would just highlight, I think our European direct lending franchise, as indicated just by the success and speed of this most recent fund, I think, is pretty unique. If you look at the growth and ultimate size of that business relative to the U.S., it has been catching up. Similar to what I just said about the APAC region. Europe was fairly well behind the U.S. market in terms of its development, and we've seen it grow to track the U.S. growth over the last 10 to 15 years. And as the market develops more, I could see us taking even more share, but that's a pretty significant market position we have there, and I think it's going to continue. Sure. Obviously, the transaction volumes being slow, I think, is largely driven by a rapid change in the cost of capital. Obviously, to the extent that you put a capital stack in place with an expectation of a 4% cost of funds, and that's now a 10% cost of funds, that's going to meaningfully hamper your financial flexibility. And on new deals, whether it's real assets or corporates, obviously, you have to now look at the cap rate and valuation environment and the cost of capital. And what that's really done is for those that want to transact, it's created lower leverage and the need to put more equity. And so if you look at equity contributions in the market today, they're approaching 57%, which is a huge level relative to historical standards. And so for those that want to transact, they're bridging it with equity.  The one thing I would highlight about the private credit asset classes, it's obviously floating rate. It's painful on the up, but it obviously can give you some relief on the way down. And while we tend to have modest call protection structured into a lot of our investments, I think for those that want to play offense there's a willingness to accept a higher cost of capital given the flexibility to prepay and to benefit from rates as they come down. And that's why I think once we get to this agreement that the hiking cycle is over and everybody can underwrite what their cost of capital is you should see you should see deal flow pick up. Jarrod, do you want to handle that one? Yes. So as I mentioned earlier, the credit performance continues to be below historical averages. I think as we get to later cycle and we have the lag effects of the rate increases, you will naturally see defaults tick up, but I don't think that they will get to the levels that we've seen in prior crisis. You've seen interest coverage levels stabilize. And I think what is different this go around, if there's a big thing to highlight again is the amount of equity subordination and equity dry powder that exists in the market is fundamentally different than we've had in prior cycles. So my own expectation is a lot of these companies that are either seeing slowing growth or deteriorating performance with challenges on the coverage side that the resolution will largely come through transfer value from the equity to the debt as opposed to losses given a spike in defaults. That's generally what we saw through COVID. It's generally what we've seen in the early behavior in this cycle, and I would expect that to continue. So defaults will go up, but that is not cause for concern I actually think that it could result in higher rates of return across the private credit landscape as there's a transfer of value from the equity to the debt in order to bridge to a lower rate environment. Yes. It's been running around 30% on the private side. But I would say that, that's not really a panacea just in terms of the rolling structure of those hedges. So I think early in the rate cycle, that was a little bit more of a benefit than I think where we are today. Yes, it's still early. They are a scientific fixed income manager. So they're applying technology and quantitative tools to the management of fixed income largely on the high-grade side in this evolving world of technology, both in terms of innovation opportunity for growth and disruption, we felt that it was important for us to understand what that technology was and what opportunities it could create for us for our traditional liquid credit business.  They're great partners. They have a very strong track record of business building from their time at Blue Bay. And time will tell in terms of what that market develops into. But the investment thesis for us is that the world of scientific fixed income management, particularly around the high-grade part of the world will continue to grow. And I think that they are one of the leaders and real innovators in that part of the market. It's a great question, Fin. I think they're quite durable. If you just take, for example, the PacWest transaction, they were close to 90 individual borrower platforms within that lender finance book, if my memory serves me correctly. And while it's a discrete loan book, those are platforms that are originating new assets and we'll have new financing requirements and needs over time. So there is an element to this transition of the assets that should grow our client base. The other thing, as I mentioned earlier, that we are mindful of because we want to be good partners to our bank partners is that what -- I think they're all going to be focused on is how do I maintain my relevance with my client based on the capital that I have? And how do I partner with friendly capital providers like Ares in order to support that client in the most effective way. And so I don't think that every one of these transactions is about clients wholesale leaving a bank and coming to Ares. I think it's more about how can we work together to support that client over time. And at least in the early days, that's generally how we're experiencing it.\nFinian O\u2019Shea: And then just a small follow-up. Noticed a small jump on the insurance investment on the balance sheet. Can you touch on that and if it relates to any change in strategy there? No, there's no change to I'd also highlight, too, that's reflective of an increase in the value of that investment given the underlying performance of the platform. I would say they will be modest contributors over time as you began to see play out in this quarter. I would highlight, though, that unlike some of our peers, a lot of those distribution type fees are actually finding their way into our underlying funds and driving higher IRRs at the product level. And so while we do have certain strategies where we're obviously sharing in origination and distribution fees with our clients, we made the determination early on in the development of Ares that those fees were for the benefit of our investors and really driving higher relative return. Which I think maybe is one of the reasons why we're enjoying such comparative success on the fundraising side. So I think you'll see it scale over time, but I don't think that it will become an overwhelmingly large number just based on the structure of the business today. Great. We had nothing further. We thank you for your time today and your continued support. We hope you enjoy the rest of the summer, and we'll look forward to catching up again next quarter. Thank you."

        "content": "Carl Drake: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for our First Quarter Conference Call. I'm joined today by Michael Arougheti, our Chief Executive Officer; and Jarrod Phillips, our Chief Financial Officer. We also have a number of executives with us today, who will be available during the Q&A session. Before we begin, I want to remind you that comments made during this call contain forward-looking statements and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those identified in our Risk Factors in our SEC filings. Our actual results could differ materially, and we undertake no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Please also note that past performance is not a guarantee of future results, and nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Ares Fund. During this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Please refer to our first quarter earnings presentation available on the Investor Resources section of our website for reconciliations of the measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Note, we plan to file our Form 10-Q early next month. This morning, we announced we declared our second quarter common dividend of $0.77 per share on the company's Class A and non-voting common stock, representing an increase of 26% of our dividend for the same quarter a year ago. The dividend will be paid on June 30th, 2023, to holders of record on June 16th. Now, I'll turn the call over to Michael Arougheti, who will start with some quarterly financial and business highlights.\nMichael Arougheti: Thanks Carl. Good morning everyone. I hope everybody is doing well. Following a volatile 2022 in the equity and debt markets, transaction activity in the first quarter got off to a slow start and was uneven across various markets that we participate in. We began to see some signs of thawing as the quarter progressed, but the dislocation in the banking sector late in the quarter created considerable uncertainty about the banking system, the economy, and ultimately, the path of interest rates. Fortunately, for Ares, our asset-light business model tends to insulate us from balance sheet-driven volatility, and our long-term investment capital enables us to be opportunistic when other market participants retrench. For the first quarter, our business metrics continued to show strong year-over-year growth, and we're on track for a more significant fundraising year, with seven of our largest commingled funds expected in the market this year. In the first quarter, we raised $16 billion in new fund commitments and ended the quarter with $360 billion of AUM. We also generated strong year-over-year growth of 25% in management fees and 24% in fee-related earnings, while delivering a strong quarter of fund performance for our investors. Our first quarter realization activity was seasonally light, but our net accrued performance receivable continues to build. And we remain on track with our original European waterfall net realized performance income guidance for this year and next year, as Jarrod will discuss later. We continue to see robust investor demand for our alternative private capital offerings. In the market, we're observing a flight to larger, higher quality managers as investors are consolidating their allocations with preferred managers. Many of our largest funds with first closes are seeing significant commitments that represent half or more of the targeted fund size and the pipelines of investors working toward closing is encouraging. We also benefit from having a high re-up and crossover rate from existing investors. For the first quarter, over 90% of our $14 billion in direct capital raised was from existing Ares investors. As we outlined last quarter, we're actively raising our sixth European direct lending fund and our second alternative credit fund. For our sixth European direct lending fund, we've seen robust demand from investors and have accepted to-date, and anticipate through early Q2, subscriptions that will bring the total first close to more than $8.5 billion of LTV commitments. This amount includes subscriptions of $4.7 billion accepted through the end of the first quarter. We continue to see strong fundraising momentum for this fund and anticipate that at final close, the fund will exceed the predecessor fund, which had \u20ac11 billion of LP commitments and \u20ac15 billion in total capital, including fund leverage. Our second alternative credit fund is also seeing significant demand. As a reminder, our alternative credit strategy deploys flexible capital focused on large, diversified portfolios of assets that generate contractual cash flows. We've accepted subscriptions to date and anticipate, through May, a total first close of approximately $3.5 billion. This includes $1.8 billion of commitments closed through the end of the first quarter. With the robust demand for this fund, we expect commitments to this fund to easily exceed that of its predecessor, which totaled $3.7 billion and we're targeting a final close later this year. This fund, like its predecessor fund, carries a unique charitable endeavor tied to our performance fees, where 10% of the carried interest for closed-end and 5% of the incentive fee for the open-end fund will be donated to support global health and education initiatives. These contributions are split equally between our investment team and Ares. Inclusive of the fund's first closing, the alternative credit platform will have over $10.5 billion of capital designated with this charitable tie-in. And based upon performance to-date, our predecessor alternative credit funds have already reached approximately $10 million for potential charitable donations. In our secondaries business, we entered into a credit secondaries joint venture with a large strategic investor with initial capital of approximately $1 billion. We believe that this well positions us to be a market leader in the growing credit secondary sector, particularly due to our leading private credit franchise, knowledge, insights, and relationships with middle-market companies and sponsors. We intend to further scale our presence in this new strategy with the recent launch of our first credit secondaries commingled fund, with the first close expected later this year. This is another great example of the types of product extensions and growth that we can bring to acquired platforms shortly after acquisition. With respect to our other fundraisers, we're on track to hold a sizable first closing for our third US senior direct lending fund, either late Q2 or early Q3. As a reminder, our second fund had $8 billion in LP commitments and approximately $14 billion in total capital, including fund leverage. We also anticipate first closes for our second climate infrastructure fund, our third infrastructure secondaries fund, and our seventh corporate private equity fund over the next several quarters. Later this year, we expect to launch our third US junior capital direct lending fund, with the first closing expected early next year. And overall, we expect to have nearly 30 different co-mingled and perpetual capital fund offerings in the market this year, in addition to our managed accounts and CLOs. Finally, last week, we priced the IPO of our second SPAC, Ares Acquisition Corp. II. We saw significant demand for the offering, with the $400 million base deal upsized to $450 million. The underwriters partially exercised their over-allotment option to get to a final close of $500 million. At the end of the closing, AAC was the second largest US IPO this year and the largest SPAC IPO since January of 2022. And we believe that this is a strong validation of our differentiated platform and approach to this asset class. With our strong initial investor demand and robust fundraising pipeline, we're already seeing a rebuilding of our shadow AUM, which increased from $42 billion at year-end to over $50 billion at quarter end. With our positive outlook for continued fundraising strength in the coming quarters, we expect to see further increases in our available capital, enabling us to be more opportunistic with our deployment in what we believe is an attractive investment environment. In the wealth management channel, we're excited to announce that we've recently launched our non-traded BDC, Ares Strategic Income Fund, or ASIF. We also remain on track to continue adding distribution partners for our US products, and we're expanding our retail distribution and products globally, including planned dedicated vehicles targeting the European and Asian regions later this year to take advantage of our credit expertise. While we, like others, continue to experience slower flows into our two non-traded REITs, unlike others, our net inflows remained positive in the first quarter with a combined approximately $350 million of gross quarterly proceeds, inclusive of our 1031 Exchange program versus approximately $200 million of quarterly redemption requests. We believe that success in the retail market will ultimately gravitate to a handful of all players that have attractive products across all the private asset classes, a global presence and large distribution and service teams who can provide education and thought leadership to financial advisers and their clients. With our continued expansion in products and distribution and the launch of our retail education portal, Access Ares, in June, we believe that we're cementing Ares as one of the leaders in the alternative retail market. From a deployment perspective, the first quarter was, as expected, slower across many of our strategies due to typical seasonal factors and decreased market activity. That said, the $12.9 billion of gross deployment in the quarter was in line with our internal expectations at the beginning of the year, and we remain on track with our growth objectives for fee-paying AUM for the year. We believe that our private credit strategies are taking market share in a smaller pool of transaction opportunities and we expect that this will pay dividends as more issuers and sponsors experience the benefit and reliability of our flexible capital solutions. Our pipelines are building in our more opportunistic strategies that often see higher deployment in dislocated markets. In alternative credit, the investment pipeline is very strong, as our team is seeing numerous opportunities out of the regional banks, including asset portfolio sales and regulatory capital trades, in addition to their normal pipeline of asset-backed transactions. In our Private Equity Group, our special opportunities team has seen a significant pickup in their pipeline as banks and other traditional providers retreat from the market. We're seeing a growing number of opportunities from companies that need solutions as they struggle to amend and extend their capital structures. In real estate, we're starting to see compelling opportunities from fund complexes that need liquidity to meet redemption requests. The most interesting opportunities currently in the pipeline are in the debt markets, where we can step into the funding gap for refinancing opportunities and provide fresh capital on a structured basis. In direct lending, we're beginning to see more deal activity and some larger transaction opportunities, which should set us up for an increase in deployment in the second quarter. The expected investment returns for this vintage of private credit are attractive with meaningfully improved terms, more conservative capital structures, higher base rates, and significant excess credit spreads. In our secondaries business, we're seeing a growing number of both LP and GP-led opportunities as certain LPs seek liquidity and certain fund sponsors look to accelerate liquidity into legacy fund vehicles. So, overall, we have many strategies that can take advantage of constrained liquidity in the market. With $88.6 billion of available capital and additional closes for several of our large commingled products in the coming months, we expect to have a strong capital base to take advantage of the market opportunities for our clients. This is also a very attractive environment for our affiliated insurance platform to be building its annuity origination business. We now have over $7.5 billion of AUM at Aspida, and over 95% of the portfolio is protected from surrender charges and without the issues associated with a large legacy book. Going forward, we expect to continue to raise third-party capital to further scale our affiliated insurance platform. We believe the strong secular growth that we continue to experience across our business is ultimately result of our strong and consistent fund performance. Our funds' portfolios are generally continuing to see cash flow growth with positive fundamentals. Despite higher interest rates flowing through to our portfolio companies, we continue to see solid cash flow growth, low defaults, and resilience in our credit metrics. For example, our US and European direct lending portfolios continue to see mid- to high single-digit year-over-year EBITDA growth. In direct lending, our loan-to-value statistics remained steady between 43% and 50% for the US and Europe. At Ares Capital Corporation, which is a good proxy for our US direct lending business, non-accruals totaled 2.3% of the portfolio at cost and 1.3% at fair value, which continue to be below our 15-year historical averages. These credit metrics remain at benign levels despite the significant increase in base rates. As a result, our direct lending funds have experienced a significant increase in coupons with a de minimis offset from credit-related issues. Our global real estate portfolio continues to see strong, but moderating rental growth and high occupancy rates. Our highest conviction sectors of industrial and multifamily account for more than 75% of the portfolio's gross assets, with another 12% invested in our favored alternative sectors, including self-storage, triple net lease, and single-family rental. In industrial, on a same-store comparable basis, we saw rent growth of approximately 70% over the last 12 months and more than 90% tenant retention across our industrial portfolio. In multifamily, our same-store re-leasing spreads continue to see 10%-or-better annual growth over the last 12 months. From an allocation standpoint, we continue to be meaningfully underweight to office, retail, and hospitality assets. Our US office equity exposure is only 2% of our global real estate portfolio. And lastly, in our private equity group, our corporate PE portfolio continues to perform well as year-over-year EBITDA increased 10%, including growth supported by accretive acquisitions and synergies. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Jarrod for comments on our financials and additional details on the performance of our funds. Jarrod?\nJarrod Phillips: Thanks Mike. Hello everyone and thank you for joining us today. As Mike stated, we once again experienced strong growth in our financial metrics, including management fees, fee-related earnings, realized income, AUM, and FPAUM compared to the first quarter of 2022. Our management fee-centric and FRE-rich business model continued to deliver strong results despite the significant market volatility in the first quarter, stemming from rising interest rates, continued geopolitical uncertainty and the challenges in the banking sector. In addition, the sizable amount of capital that we've raised year-to-date has strengthened our available capital position and sets us up for greater deployment-driven growth in our FRE and margin expansion during the second half of this year. Starting with revenues. Our management fees totaled over $600 million in the quarter, an increase of 25% compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by deployment of our available capital. Other fee income of approximately $20 million was largely in line with the first quarter of 2022. FRE totaled $255 million, an increase of 24% from the first quarter of 2022, driven by higher management fees from deployment over the last 12 months. In a market environment that continues to be characterized by volatility and lower transaction volume, our ability to grow through management fees and FRE is a significant differentiator for Ares. Our FRE margin for the first quarter totaled 40.6%, roughly a 70 basis point improvement from the 39.9% in the fourth quarter, but in line with the 40.6% margin from the fourth quarter, excluding the large impact from FRPR. As we stated on last quarter's call, we expect to see margin growth resume in the second half of 2023, with a larger step-up in 2024 and 2025 as we absorb the impact of our historical hiring and deploy the significant capital that we have raised and will continue to raise over the next several quarters. As such, we continue to be on track to achieve our goal of a 45% run rate FRE margin by year-end 2025. Our realization activity was limited in the first quarter, with net realized performance income of over $7 million, as equity market volatility and significantly lower transaction volume reduced monetization opportunities. We are optimistic that once the market has clarity around peak Fed funds rate and the direction of the economy, we could see an increased monetization opportunity. Despite limited European waterfall realized income in the first quarter, we continue to remain on track for the $100 million we expect in 2023, which is largely derived from credit and credit-light funds. For 2023, we currently have visibility on at least $20 million of European waterfall net realized performance income in Q2, with the remainder likely coming from tax distribution-related payments from our funds in the fourth quarter. Generally, we expect 60% to 80% of these types of distributions to be recorded in the fourth quarter and then most of the remaining distribution to occur in the second quarter, once payments are finalized. We do expect less seasonality in our European waterfall realizations to start in 2024 and beyond, as we reach the harvest stages of the fund lives for certain funds. Realized income in the first quarter totaled $254 million, up 15% from the year-ago period. After-tax realized income per share of Class A common stock was $0.71, 9% higher than the level of the first quarter of 2022. As of March 31st, our AUM totaled $360 billion compared to $325 billion a year ago. Our fee-paying AUM totaled $234 billion at quarter end, an increase of 18% from the prior year. Our year-over-year growth in fee-paying AUM was primarily driven by meaningful deployment across our US and EU Direct Lending, special opportunities and credit -- alternative credit strategies, which all pay management fees on invested capital. As Mike mentioned, our expectations assumed a slower deployment environment in the first quarter and our actual results were in line with our expectations for fundraising deployment and quarter-ending AUM and fee-paying AUM. As Mike highlighted, we're rebuilding our shadow AUM, which sets the stage for higher deployment and future management fee growth. Our AUM not yet paying fees available for future deployment totaled $51 billion at quarter end, which represents over $480 million of incremental potential future management fees. Our incentive-eligible AUM increased by 10% from the first quarter of 2022 to $211 billion. Of this amount, $67 billion was uninvested at year-end. In the first quarter, our net accrued performance income rose to $882 million, an increase of $50 million from the previous quarter. Of this $882 million of net accrued performance income at year-end, $614 million or nearly 70% was in European style waterfall funds, of which $351 million is from funds that are past their reinvestment period. Regarding fund performance, despite an extended period of market volatility, our strategies generally continue to perform well relative to their benchmarks. While the full performance details are in our earnings presentation, we wanted to highlight some of our larger fund strategies. In credit, all our key composite strategies across US and European Direct Lending and alternative credit delivered positive gross performance for the first quarter, ranging from 1% to 4%, with 4% to 11% returns for the last 12 months. In private equity, both of our core investment strategies have meaningfully outperformed the public equity and high-yield markets over the past year. These strategies are designed to take advantage of the volatility in the markets. Our special opportunities composite generated a gross return of 3.2% in the first quarter and 10% over the last 12 months. Our corporate private equity composite was down a modest 70 basis points in the quarter, but up more than 4% for the last 12 months. Within real estate, our US real estate equity composite gross return modestly declined 70 basis points for the quarter, but was up slightly over the last 12 months as cash flow growth was largely offset by increases in cap rates. Lastly, as we announced last quarter, we closed the purchase of the remaining 20% of Ares SSG's management business that we didn't already own. Our business across the region now has nearly 60 people in 8 offices managing approximately $12 billion in AUM. We hope to expand our geographic reach and product set across the Asia-Pacific region over time under a rebranded Ares Asia. We're investing and expanding our investment capabilities to mirror what we have in the US and Europe, including recent growth initiatives in real estate, growth equity, secondaries, alternative credit, and infrastructure. In addition to our regular quarterly materials, we posted a supplemental deck, which reclassifies historical financial results to reflect the Ares SSG business within our Credit Group. Since this business is now wholly owned by Ares, we include the former Ares SSG credit funds within our existing credit segment. Finally, before I pass the call back over to Mike, I wanted to reiterate that based on our fundraising and deployment outlook, we remain on track with our growth objectives and the financial guidance that we provided on our last earnings call. Mike?\nMichael Arougheti: Thanks Jarrod. In 2022, we focused on investing in the talent and the infrastructure needed to support our significant fundraising and deployment ambitions for the next several years. This year, we're now focused on executing on these goals, and we're off to a great start with several of our important fundraises, which we believe will set us up for strong growth for the remainder of this year and beyond. We've also made great strides in broadening our product suite, both organically and through strategic acquisitions over the past few years. We're pleased to have fully integrated these acquired platforms, and we're on plan with our strategic and financial objectives. We're now in the process of scaling these businesses with new products and other synergies. We've already executed on several of our growth objectives, including the launch of our Australian direct lending and credit secondary strategies in the institutional channel, along with the formation of AWMS and the launches of our private markets fund and our nontraded BDC in the wealth channel. We also have exciting growth plans for our infrastructure debt strategy. So, in conclusion, we believe that our business is well positioned to take advantage of the volatile market backdrop. Looking at our historical performance, some of the fastest periods of our growth have come during recessions and market dislocations. I believe that we're better equipped than ever as we potentially approach another similar period. Currently, we have more available capital, a larger team and more tools in our toolbox, which we believe positions us well to take advantage of the many opportunities that we expect to see in this market environment. Our long-term capital flexibility and scale, asset-light balance sheet, and robust investment in portfolio management capabilities puts us in the position to be opportunistic when others cannot. As always, I'm grateful for the hard work and dedication of our team, and I'm appreciative of our investors' continuing support for our company. And operator, I think we can now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Hey Mike. Hope everyone is doing well and congrats on the ASIF launch. My first one is on fundraising. So, your institutional sales teams must be very, very busy at this moment, raising multiple flagships in parallel. But can you comment on interest levels between your credit funds and then your private equity fund and also how re-up conversations are trending? And I'm especially interested in [Indiscernible].\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. Obviously, we don't comment on specific funds in the market. So, maybe, I'll just give you a couple of themes to think about. Obviously, you saw what we accomplished in our core commingled credit funds with some pretty meaningful and quick first closes relative to prior fund size for the alternative credit vehicle as well as the European credit vehicle. And as we talked about in the prepared remarks, 90% of the commitments that came in, in the quarter were from existings. So, that should give you a pretty good indication for the re-up appetite and the receptivity from our existings. Also, you saw just since quarter end, in those two funds alone, we brought in commitments of an additional $5 billion plus. And so that momentum continues. I would say, generally speaking, all things private credit are being very well received, not surprisingly, given the defensive positioning of the asset class to benefit from rising interest rates, the ability to deploy more actively in a lower transaction environment. And I would, again, expect that to continue, both for institutional and retail. We are seeing from investors, I don't know if I would call it reduced appetite for private equity, but reduced ability to invest in pure regular way private equity. And what I mean by that would just be non-differentiated growth buyout. And that's largely a function of the transaction environment money not coming back to those LPs and therefore, denominator effect. We're still in the early days of our private equity fund raise, but I would remind you that we have a pretty differentiated approach. Obviously, we've been in that business for over 20 years with a consistent track record, but we do have a distress for control capability in that fund, and that fund actively invests alongside our successful SOF franchise. And so our expectation and hope are that, given the ability for that strategy to play distressed and opportunistic the way a lot of our credit strategies are that we'll have a differentiated experience, but still too early to tell.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thanks Mike. And then just kind of refocusing that within credit, how are you seeing demand trend between private credit and liquid credit, really just given perceived valuation discount now on the liquid side? And I know a lot of your -- some of your liquid funds tend to be in open vehicles that are redeemable. But on the sales front, are you seeing any sort of shift in the demand to the liquid side?\nMichael Arougheti: It's a good question. We've actually -- we saw really good inflows on our liquid credit business in the first quarter. So, I think to your point, people do see the value opportunity in the liquid credit markets. I'd also point out, if you look at our core private credit funds, ASOF, Pathfinder, even ARCC, those funds all have the ability to flex between liquid and illiquid. And so you should expect that when the public markets are offering significantly better value, we'll be spending time there and then obviously harvesting those gains to redeploy into the private side of the house when that deployment opportunity picks up. So, there is a fair amount of dynamism in the existing \"private funds\" that are taking advantage of that liquid market opportunity. And I think our investors see that, and that's reflected in the fundraising as well.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Great. Thanks Mike.\nMichael Arougheti: Thanks Craig.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Beatty with UBS. Please proceed.\nAdam Beatty: Thank you and good morning. Just want to ask about redemption requests in the wealth management channel, which seemed to have ticked up somewhat, although acknowledging that, that positive net flows are obviously still a very good thing given the backdrop. But just wondering what you're seeing as the motivation or drivers for the elevated redemption request. Is it specific to the real estate asset class or just client liquidity needs or what have you? It would be great to get your thoughts on that. Thank you.\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, it's a good question, Adam. And again, we've -- I think we're fortunate and differentiated from some of the peers and that we are continuing to see net flows in both the REIT complex as well as the credit interval fund. And as we highlighted, we have recently launched our non-traded BDC with $1.5 billion of capital, and we're bringing that into the retail channel in the back half of the year and expect healthy demand there. So, seeing the flows, it would tell you that the appetite within the channel for alt is still intact. And we do know that in talking to the top of the house at most of the large wealth and RIA platforms, that the desire to grow alt exposure is also intact. So, when you look at what's going on, I -- we never really know the motivation for redemption. I think some of the early redemptions we saw in peer portfolios was less a comment on the market and more that some of those folks owned the REIT shares on leverage and they were getting redeemed, and there was a little bit of leverage unwind coming out of certain geographies. I think now it's probably a combination of the two things that you highlighted, Adam, which is just a general commentary on perceived risk and opportunity in the commercial real estate market and obviously, client liquidity. But I can't apportion the outflows to those two in any quantitative way, but I think those are definitely at play. I will say, just looking at some of the peer data and the market data, it does appear that some of those outflows are slowing. And I think when we get to stabilized rates and stabilized cap rates, that you'd hopefully see that trend reverse.\nAdam Beatty: Excellent. Thank you, Mike. That's helpful. And then I just wanted to turn to Aspida and annuity underwriting and just kind of what you see as the growth capacity there? It can be somewhat at least resource-intensive to do annuity originations. But just how much you're growing kind of capacity there and then assuming some productivity improvement will layer on to that? Thanks.\nMichael Arougheti: So, I think one of the things that we've tried to articulate, but I don't know if it's appreciated, is one of the benefits of the way that we've organically built the Aspida platform, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, is we're not dealing with surrenders or legacy book challenges. But we also have a fully tech-enabled paperless insurance platform, which actually is pretty efficient in terms of managing annuity sales and scaling. Telling you what you probably know, we have the ability to accelerate or moderate sales based on price and structure of the product offering. And depending on where we are in terms of our deployment or a view on the yield opportunity on the asset side, we'll push and pull on it. But to give you some perspective, in the first quarter, we were doing about $600 million per month in new annuity sales, just to give you a sense for capacity on the platform in this type of market environment.\nAdam Beatty: Excellent. That helps a lot. Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nAlex Blostein: Hey Mike and everybody. Thanks for taking the question. First question, I wanted to zone in on kind of the current environment and the fact that dislocation in the regional bank space is likely to have longer-lasting effects, I guess, some credit availability broadly across the market. So with that in mind, I'm just curious to get your thoughts on what businesses do you expect to get Ares much larger on the back of some of these kind of rising lending constraints in the space that might not be as large today, but could be really interesting down the road?\nMichael Arougheti: It's a great question and obviously, this is purely us speculating, but it's informed by what we've seen in prior cycles. The first phase of this, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, is that we are seeing a very healthy amount of pipeline building with the banks themselves as our counterparty on portfolio sales, red cap trades and various other things just as they navigate the current environment. The biggest beneficiary of this first phase is our alternative credit business. As the banks, both being in small, retreat to kind of their core businesses and exit large portions of the market, I think that will create opportunity in the primary market for alt credit. And I'd put that probably at the top of the list of growth opportunity coming out of this. That being said, when you think about bank behavior and credit contraction, commercial real estate lending, I think, will be a significant beneficiary. I think telling you what you know, Alex, if you look at commercial real estate exposure, 70% of commercial real estate loans are held in the banking system. And on average, 40% of regional bank balance sheets are commercial real estate loan exposures. And so if there is credit contraction and stress at the property level, I think that's going to open up a pretty big opportunity for us globally in and around the commercial real estate lending business. Needless to say, as the larger banks maybe reduce focus or have the inability to be as aggressive as they have been on the leverage finance side of the house, big beneficiaries there are our SOF franchise and our direct lending franchise. And then I would also just highlight, generally, given the position of our private equity business, both ACOF and ASOF as we begin to see capital structure distress and operating distress, they're going to be big beneficiaries as well. So, I kind of just mentioned all of our strategies. Now, that I think about it, I would say some are going to have more direct benefit, but I think this credit contraction is real, and I think it's going to really drive more capital into the hands of folks like us.\nAlex Blostein: Got it. That's perfect. That makes a ton of sense. My second question for you guys was around the secondaries business. I know, Mike, you talked about rising pipeline of opportunities there as well, both on the GP side and the LP side. But I guess when we look at the trends recently, management fee growth has been a little bit more muted. So, maybe help us bridge kind of the near-term trends and the outlook for kind of that business resuming management fee growth over the next, call it, I don't know, 18, 24 months.\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. So, the bulk of that business was the Landmark acquisition. We're now two years removed from closing. That's been fully integrated, what I would say, retooled from a product standpoint, and now we've begun to innovate and grow. So, the two big new products coming off of that platform are our PMS fund, our private markets fund, which is our first private equity-oriented product that we put into the wealth channel, and we have high hopes for the long-term growth opportunity there. And two, is the launch of our credited secondaries business, which was always a very big motivator behind the big push into the secondaries market. Interesting, when you just look at the acquisition, we kind of acquired the current vintage of PE fund midstream, and we're now deploying our 17 fund that was kind of raised during the acquisition and initial integration period, and we are currently capital raising for our real estate and infra strategies as well. So, we're in capital formation mode. And then obviously, as we begin to have closings on those, you'll begin to see the revenue begin to tick up, both on committed capital and invested capital for the credit strategies. The reason we're so optimistic there is back to this overarching theme of capital constraint illiquidity and denominator effect, we are seeing LPs seriously look at liquidity in the secondary market. I would expect that 2023 will likely be a record year for LP-led secondaries, just based on what we're seeing year-to-date and the way the pipeline is developing. But needless to say, the pricing in that market is more attractive than it's been in a long time, and we're seeing the market bid kind of 85, 90 for PE and maybe 70, 75 for venture. So, there's a real value opportunity there. And then on the GP side, for those GPs that are in between funds are experiencing a slower capital raise for their next fund getting into the GP-led side of the house with things like continuation funds and NAV loans, we think, is going to turn on in earnest as well, and that's -- that pipeline is building. So, I think the supply-demand dynamic in that market is extraordinarily good.\nAlex Blostein: That\u2019s great color. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey, morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe circling back to some of the commentary on the banks pulling back and the opportunity set there. If banks continue to pull back and tighten lending standards, it would seem like on one hand, that leaves a void in the market where firms like yourself and private credit can step in. You mentioned some areas that you're excited in CRE and alt credit. But how much of a void can the private markets and Ares fill? And on the other hand, you also borrow from the banks across a number of your businesses. Maybe you can remind us where you borrow from the banks. So, what sort of impact that could have if they were to tighten standards for you?\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. It's an astute question. We do borrow from the banks. Probably 60% to 65% of where we borrow is to leverage our private credit portfolios. And similarly, I'd probably venture to say 60% to 65% of that borrower is from the G-SIBs. I think in markets like this, as we consolidate share, I think you're going to see the G-SIB consolidate share as well and probably do more business with the larger platforms. So, my hope is that even with overall shrinking of capital availability, that Ares and those like us will get a disproportionate share of that balance sheet. The implication, though, is that if that leverage is not available, obviously, given the return expectations of our investors, that just means higher unlevered ROAs in the market, which means valuations need to continue to come down to meet that market reality, which is obviously deflationary. And I would say the same for just the basic capital constraint that we already talked about. Obviously, I don't think that the private markets can absorb the entirety of that channel, nor should they. Obviously, we live symbiotically with the banks as partners in a lot of the things that we do. But if you look at C&I loans across the entire banking landscape, they're pushing $3 trillion today. And if you look at private credit installed base in the US market, it's about $1 trillion. So, there's going to need to be a pretty significant amount of capital formation in order for the private markets to really fill the void if it's significant. So, it could challenge the economy. I think the flip side of that is obviously, the private markets will get an opportunity to be extremely selective in the risks that they want to take and what they want to get paid for that risk if capital is scarce. And I think that's one of the reasons why we're so excited about the backdrop. I would expect that we're going to get higher risk-adjusted returns for higher quality borrowers and assets that we've seen in a long time.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thanks. And just a follow-up question on CRE. Clearly, a lot of concern out there in the marketplace around commercial real estate. What are some of the key risks that you guys see across the space as you look out? How do you see that playing out so far? What are some of the signposts you guys are looking for? And maybe you can help quantify what sort of opportunity set could that be for Ares over time.\nMichael Arougheti: I'll give you my thoughts. Bill Benjamin, our Global Head of Real Estate, is on as well, so he could probably do a deeper dive. But I think you have to -- you can't look at all segments of commercial real estate as equal, and you can't look at the geographies the same way either. So, obviously, office is severely challenged right now. Whereas as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, industrial and most of the multifamily sectors that we're participating in are still seeing good fundamental strength. Europe is showing some differentiation from the US, European office. We're not quite seeing the same work-from-home stresses and supply-demand imbalances there. European retail actually starting to get a little bit more interesting. So, there's also a bifurcation between US and Europe. I think the biggest issue, frankly, is you have a broadly leveraged asset class with base rates that are up 500 basis points. And so you're seeing, and we see this in our primary market, unlevered debt yields in that market, 9.5%, 10% plus, and that just becomes really difficult to support if you're an equity owner of a challenged piece of real estate and, obviously, has a pretty significant implication for future value. So, that market is going to have to go through a pretty significant period of repricing and deleveraging. There are a handful of maturities that are going to be coming up here in the next 12 to 24 months that will continue to stress the market. But Bill, I'll kick it to you to tack on to that as...\nBill Benjamin: Thanks, Mike. I would be echoing much of what has been said already. I think that the biggest risk is the fundamentals in the office market, where we are, thankfully, on a global basis, very underexposed. It's less than 10% of our net asset value, and it's only 2% in the US, I believe. So, -- but the contraction of credit that was touched upon a few minutes ago, it will make our life a little bit more challenging for the next 24 to 36 months, but it will be an opportunity for our growing debt business. The milestones that we're looking for is a bottoming out on values. And I'm not sure we're there yet, and I don't want to call it, but what we're seeing are moderating. We're seeing discount rates and terminal cap rates in the third-party valuations. We are getting for much of our portfolio embedding a lot of equity risk premium. So, we think values are coming. And we want to see more realistic selling in the market. There's opportunistic purchases from funds that have gates coming down or at the end of their life, and sponsors are either very in the money or very out of the money. But we'd like to see a bit more liquidity in the market and realism in the sales market and then continued strong leasing in the sectors that Mike touched upon. We are to growing student exposure for both in the US and in Europe and leasing has done about now or a little bit earlier for the next academic year, and we are way, way ahead of where we've been in prior years. So, that's a sector that we are very bullish on as well. So, office fundamentals and availability of capital are the biggest risks, but the ability to use capital either in our debt or in structure subordinated equity positions in our other funds are going to create very good opportunities.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thank you.\nMichael Arougheti: Thanks Bill.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Mckenna with JMP Securities. Please proceed.\nBrian Mckenna: Great. Thanks. So, there's clearly a lot of focus on private credit right now. And just given everything going on in the backdrop more broadly, there's a lot of opportunities within this part of the industry. So, we're starting to see more and more new players coming into the space. So, it will be great just to get your updated thoughts on the competitive landscape for private credit specifically, and then how you kind of see it evolving over time?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, I think you have to find the signal through the noise, because there's a lot of folks that are hanging a shingle in the private credit space that are not really forming capital of any significance or building the necessary origination investment and portfolio management infrastructure to scale. And so I think the large entrenched players are the players and there will be some folks that nibble around the edges. But I would say from a competitive set, we're not seeing significant new entrants taking share. We have a number of entrenched competitors that are undercapitalized right now. So, we're actually seeing some reduced capital in the market, which we think will benefit us given where we are in our fundraising cycle. But yes, I would say not a significant change, and this is not a market that you just jump into, right? If you look at what we've been building here over the last 20-plus years, in our US business, we have 180 people. We're actively calling on 500 private equity sponsors in our private credit direct lending business. We've deployed over $100 billion with incredible performance. You can't really replicate that, both from a track record relationship and expense standpoint. So, as I said earlier, I would expect that market share will continue to consolidate behind the scale players, like it has in every other cycle that we've experienced. And I would highlight that, that's true in Europe as well, where we probably have an even greater leadership position across the private credit landscape.\nBrian Mckenna: Yes. Very helpful. Thanks Mike. And then just to follow-up on the new non-traded BDC that you launched. Could you just talk about early demanded feedback for this product, just given the current environment that we're in? And then what's the ramp going to look like in terms of adding new distribution partners over the next 12 to 18 months?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. So, again, too early to tell. We took the approach of seeding the fund to get it scaled. So, that when we took it into the wealth channel, people would see the portfolio, and we would not have to deal with any meaningful J curve issue as we supported the growing dividend there. So, as we talked about, we have $1.5 billion of capital already in there through the seeding of that fund. It formally launched a week ago. And as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we have our first retail distribution partner coming online in Q2. And so I think on the next earnings call, we'll have a better sense for kind of what the steady-state demand is out of that first distribution partner. But again, if you believe that private credit is in demand and that the wealth channel is under allocated to private credit similar to the institutions. I think given our brand and given the track record of performance that we've demonstrated in ARCC over the last 19 years, that the demand will be there. But we'll have a much better sense the next time we're all together once we get the product into the channel.\nBrian Mckenna: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Benjamin Budish with Barclays. Please proceed.\nBenjamin Budish: Hi there. Thanks so much for taking the question. I wanted to check back on the European waterfall opportunity. It sounds like you're still quite confident on the outlook for this year. Can you maybe just remind us how much of the longer term look comes from private equity versus credit? Just so we can kind of get a better sense of what is the risk as we look further out that those targets may be easily achievable, more challenging. And any color you could provide there?\nJarrod Phillips: Sure. Thanks Ben. Great to hear from you. Yes, we still -- as I reiterated in my prepared remarks, we're still pretty confident about that end-of-the-year amount. I'll remind you and I touched on it a little bit in my comments, that we're still in the early stages of the harvest period and as we enter more into the later stages of the harvest period, that's when you are kind of removing that seasonality that we see. Right now, the seasonality means that we see larger tax-related payments that happened in the fourth quarter with a true-up to the tax actual payments that happened here in the second quarter. And so that's what drove my prepared remarks, but we still reiterated the guidance for this year. In terms of that long-term amount that we laid out for you and put into the presentation and you can find on our Investor Relations website, about 75% of that balance is from credit-oriented. So, the majority or the vast majority of it is really coming from our credit-oriented funds. So, that's what allows us to have that high predictability in terms of what we believe the balance will ultimately be. And it's always a little bit subjective in terms of when that will occur once you enter into that full harvest mode, but it becomes a much more predictable balance.\nBenjamin Budish: Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. Maybe one more kind of tactical question just about what happened in Q1. I think you mentioned the nearly $13 billion of deployment was on track versus your initial expectations. Just curious, to what extent did March sort of result in a bit of a slowdown? And perhaps to what degree were you ahead of track in January and February, such that you sort of ended up the quarter where you thought you'd be?\nMichael Arougheti: Go ahead. Go ahead, Jarrod. I'll chime in after. Go ahead.\nJarrod Phillips: Yes, absolutely. I'd say the one thing that's important to remember is that Q1 is always seasonally slow. And as we looked at Q4 of last year and coming into Q1, we were expecting a little bit of a slowdown time. And then you've always -- for the last few years, you've always had something happened in that February and March timeframe that's resulted in a little bit of slowness. We had the banking issues in that sector, which did create just a little bit of time. But overall, I think as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, you've seen our pipelines begin to build in direct lending. You've seen there's a little bit more activity that's beginning to happen. It's kind of what we see every year around this time, but it was overall a slower quarter, and that was in line with what we expected.\nBenjamin Budish: Got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kenneth Lee with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nKenneth Lee: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just to piggyback on the previous question around capital deployment. Wonder if you could just share your thoughts on how aggressive could you be in terms of deploying capital within private credit or direct lending, just given -- especially given very attractive terms and spreads and the current macro backdrop? Thanks.\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. So, I don't know how to say aggressive. And I think if you look at the size and scale of those businesses, obviously, there's a pretty consistent amount of deployment. So, if you look, year-on-year LTM deployment for US direct lending was $32 billion in 2022. It's about $25 billion right now. European was $12 billion. Now, it's close to $14 billion. So, that's showing a little bit of growth. But those businesses are at a scale now where there's some pretty steady deployment. And we've talked about this before, 50% or so of deployment opportunities in those businesses is coming from within the existing portfolio, either as companies deleverage and look to re-leverage, execute on a growth plan, go through a change of ownership. So, there's an embedded pipeline of opportunity just given the size and diversification that exists in the existing portfolios. The market is definitely coming our way. And so I think as we scale capital, that should also have the impact of scaling deployment. So, as we're getting these funds into the market and having successful closings, that sets us up to be a little more \"aggressive\" as you said on the deployment side as well.\nKenneth Lee: Got you. Very helpful there. And then one follow-up. Perhaps I wonder if you could just tell us what you're seeing in terms of recent direct lending trends within Europe or Asia, especially given the announcement about the SSG business? Maybe highlight some of the key differences you're seeing with what you're seeing within the US? Thanks.\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, I would say US and Europe are kind of in line right now in terms of the structure of new loans and the risk return that we're generating and the performance of the existing portfolios. So, we're pleased with the consistency. Particularly, I think some of the concerns that folks were having around more challenging economic backdrop in the Eurozone, we're just not seeing that roll through the portfolios or the transaction activity. Just to put things in perspective, which is why people are so excited, most new loans in those markets are getting priced on a first-lien basis, somewhere between SOFR 5.50% and 5.75% at lower attachment points and better structures with three points of fee and some modest call protection, in many cases. So, back-of-the-envelope math is pretty high quality. First-lien loan is getting priced in the 11.5% to 12% range. And then obviously, to the extent that, that bleeds into second lien or unitranche or now into the mid-teens unlevered. So, it's pretty compelling, particularly in a market where it's just difficult to price equity risk. Asia-Pacific, it's hard to say because it's different by country and by region. I'd say the regular way acquisition finance business in Australia and New Zealand, which is a more mature capital market and buyout market, we're seeing similar types of trends, both on credit and deployment. And then I would say, in other parts of the market, it's much more of a special sits and opportunistic credit play, which really speaks to the strength of the legacy SSG team over there. So, the APAC opportunity, it's not as robust from an [Indiscernible] standpoint, but probably offering more consistent, opportunistic plays across the region.\nKenneth Lee: Got you. Very helpful there. Thanks again.\nMichael Arougheti: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Brown with KBW. Please proceed.\nMike Brown: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions. So, just looking at the investment income line in the real assets segment this quarter, it looks like it was impacted by subdued activity in the debt markets. And based on some of the real estate commentary you guys made earlier in Q&A, it does sound like activity there remains relatively subdued. So, if that continues to remain weak here, should we expect a repeat of 1Q for that line in the second quarter? And then what should we be looking at in the public markets or monitoring, just to keep an eye on when that activity would pick up?\nJarrod Phillips: Mike, do you want me to take that?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, if you want. I can chime in after this.\nJarrod Phillips: Yes. Taking a look at that, it's really hard to predict because most of what we have in our investment income is a result of us seeding funds or our GP stakes in funds that ultimately weren't taken as employee co-invest. So, there is an episodic nature of when we recognize some things. Now, in terms of some of the vehicles that we have in there that are more debt-oriented, there is some expense that comes through just on the use of leverage that's in there and on the use of line fees. So, if we don't actually have a transaction that comes through, we still obviously have to pay that line fee. So, it is hard to predict from quarter-to-quarter what exactly that will be. We typically do have sales throughout every period, as Bill and Mike both mentioned earlier. As the market thaws or as there's an opportunity to sell assets, some of our more legacy funds may take advantage of that, but it's really hard to predict exactly when that will occur.\nMike Brown: Okay, great. And great to just the update on what you guys are seeing from a credit perspective in your portfolios. I guess we're also kind of contending with where is -- where are the credit risks going to emerge next. And so from your vantage point, where do you think that, that may occur? It sounds like real estate is still, of course, where some of the challenges will probably continue to arise. But as you look out over the next 12 to 18 months, what are you guys thinking about in terms of how credit could evolve from here?\nMichael Arougheti: Look, your crystal ball is as good as ours. I think real estate -- again, certain sectors of real estate is probably the easiest to see, just given the leverage profile and debt yields in that market. I think we could see a weakening of kind of lower end of the consumer market. I don't think we have exposure there, but that could present some opportunities in our alt credit business. Kind of on the middle market side, as I said, we're just not really seeing -- we're not seeing it. We had 8% EBITDA growth in our ARCC book, which again is a good proxy for the US direct lending business. In our private equity franchise, we saw 5% to 10% EBITDA growth. So, the earnings are coming through. I think some of the inflationary pressures are abating. And if you look at the stresses in the corporate market right now, it's really about over-levered balance sheets and a 500 basis point increase in base rates in 12 months, more than it's about earnings recession. And for better or for worse, we've been the big beneficiary of that increase in base rates. And so when we're coming to the table, talking to our partners on the equity side as a counterparty on a loan, it's typically around how do we relieve cash burden of the capital structure in exchange for other compensation. But it is a different set up than we've seen in prior cycles where typically, when we're talking about defaults, earnings are falling out of bed and rates are coming down. So, we're giving away return while we're dealing with operational distress. And most of the conversations now are really about just capital structure flexibility and the inability for folks to service their existing capital structures. And that's an easier conversation. Frankly, it's an easier risk to box right now, and that's generally what the conversations have been on the bulk of the corporate loan book.\nMike Brown: Great. I really appreciate the thoughts Mike.\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rufus Hone with BMO Capital. Please proceed.\nRufus Hone: Hey, good morning. Probably a question for Jarrod. I wanted to come back to some of the comments you made around investments that you've been making in the platform over the past couple of years. And I was hoping you could spend a minute on how we should think about that translating in terms of compensation and G&A growth for the rest of 2023. And how that might play into the FRE margin outlook? Thank you.\nJarrod Phillips: Sure. So, we've made -- you can kind of quantify the investments in a number of different manners. Obviously, the acquisitions that we've had over the last couple of years are investments where we've used our balance sheet capital for that. And then there's also other investments, for example, taking a GP stake in new funds as you launch into a new strategy or you enter into a joint venture with a partner to launch that strategy. So, often, that can come with a lot of internal resources, so that it is not depreciative to your FRE margins. That can actually ultimately be very accretive to those margins because you might be branching out a strategy in an area where you're already -- where you already have activity for something like our sports media and entertainment fund, where we already have individuals involved, and we're able to launch a new vehicle off of that. Or you could have something like our credit secondaries business, where we're able to use people from our credit business as well as bringing in some outside people and using some of the internal secondaries professionals to build a new strategy within that. So, those amounts, those are a little bit harder to quantify in terms of how your FRE is ultimately impacted at the outset. What you do see is the use of capital from the balance sheet to make investments -- to make co-investments along with joint ventures. As we've talked about in the last couple of calls, really where we were in 2021 and 2022 is we knew that we were going to have some very large commingled products coming to the market over this year, and we knew that we needed to prepare as a business for those and begin to hire and build out the ability to source and originate as well as to serve through the back and middle offices. So, that hiring is what led to our extreme headcount increases over the last couple of years. And as we talked about at year-end, that we thought that, that would moderate into this year as we really digested those hires, began to raise and then deploy those new larger commingled funds. So, that's really what's gone into the FRE guidance that we've talked a little bit about saying that we're still on pace for that 45% run rate that we laid out at our Investor Day at 2025. But in addition, as we see us coming to that, we believe that the second half of this year we'll really begin to see the margin expansion as we see that deployment ramp more earnestly.\nRufus Hone: Thanks Jarrod.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Michael Arougheti for closing comments.\nMichael Arougheti: I don't have any other than just want to thank everybody for their time today and look forward to speaking again in a couple of months and hopefully have some great updates. Talk to everybody soon. Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jarrod Phillips",
            "content": "Thanks Mike. Hello everyone and thank you for joining us today. As Mike stated, we once again experienced strong growth in our financial metrics, including management fees, fee-related earnings, realized income, AUM, and FPAUM compared to the first quarter of 2022. Our management fee-centric and FRE-rich business model continued to deliver strong results despite the significant market volatility in the first quarter, stemming from rising interest rates, continued geopolitical uncertainty and the challenges in the banking sector. In addition, the sizable amount of capital that we've raised year-to-date has strengthened our available capital position and sets us up for greater deployment-driven growth in our FRE and margin expansion during the second half of this year. Starting with revenues. Our management fees totaled over $600 million in the quarter, an increase of 25% compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by deployment of our available capital. Other fee income of approximately $20 million was largely in line with the first quarter of 2022. FRE totaled $255 million, an increase of 24% from the first quarter of 2022, driven by higher management fees from deployment over the last 12 months. In a market environment that continues to be characterized by volatility and lower transaction volume, our ability to grow through management fees and FRE is a significant differentiator for Ares. Our FRE margin for the first quarter totaled 40.6%, roughly a 70 basis point improvement from the 39.9% in the fourth quarter, but in line with the 40.6% margin from the fourth quarter, excluding the large impact from FRPR. As we stated on last quarter's call, we expect to see margin growth resume in the second half of 2023, with a larger step-up in 2024 and 2025 as we absorb the impact of our historical hiring and deploy the significant capital that we have raised and will continue to raise over the next several quarters. As such, we continue to be on track to achieve our goal of a 45% run rate FRE margin by year-end 2025. Our realization activity was limited in the first quarter, with net realized performance income of over $7 million, as equity market volatility and significantly lower transaction volume reduced monetization opportunities. We are optimistic that once the market has clarity around peak Fed funds rate and the direction of the economy, we could see an increased monetization opportunity. Despite limited European waterfall realized income in the first quarter, we continue to remain on track for the $100 million we expect in 2023, which is largely derived from credit and credit-light funds. For 2023, we currently have visibility on at least $20 million of European waterfall net realized performance income in Q2, with the remainder likely coming from tax distribution-related payments from our funds in the fourth quarter. Generally, we expect 60% to 80% of these types of distributions to be recorded in the fourth quarter and then most of the remaining distribution to occur in the second quarter, once payments are finalized. We do expect less seasonality in our European waterfall realizations to start in 2024 and beyond, as we reach the harvest stages of the fund lives for certain funds. Realized income in the first quarter totaled $254 million, up 15% from the year-ago period. After-tax realized income per share of Class A common stock was $0.71, 9% higher than the level of the first quarter of 2022. As of March 31st, our AUM totaled $360 billion compared to $325 billion a year ago. Our fee-paying AUM totaled $234 billion at quarter end, an increase of 18% from the prior year. Our year-over-year growth in fee-paying AUM was primarily driven by meaningful deployment across our US and EU Direct Lending, special opportunities and credit -- alternative credit strategies, which all pay management fees on invested capital. As Mike mentioned, our expectations assumed a slower deployment environment in the first quarter and our actual results were in line with our expectations for fundraising deployment and quarter-ending AUM and fee-paying AUM. As Mike highlighted, we're rebuilding our shadow AUM, which sets the stage for higher deployment and future management fee growth. Our AUM not yet paying fees available for future deployment totaled $51 billion at quarter end, which represents over $480 million of incremental potential future management fees. Our incentive-eligible AUM increased by 10% from the first quarter of 2022 to $211 billion. Of this amount, $67 billion was uninvested at year-end. In the first quarter, our net accrued performance income rose to $882 million, an increase of $50 million from the previous quarter. Of this $882 million of net accrued performance income at year-end, $614 million or nearly 70% was in European style waterfall funds, of which $351 million is from funds that are past their reinvestment period. Regarding fund performance, despite an extended period of market volatility, our strategies generally continue to perform well relative to their benchmarks. While the full performance details are in our earnings presentation, we wanted to highlight some of our larger fund strategies. In credit, all our key composite strategies across US and European Direct Lending and alternative credit delivered positive gross performance for the first quarter, ranging from 1% to 4%, with 4% to 11% returns for the last 12 months. In private equity, both of our core investment strategies have meaningfully outperformed the public equity and high-yield markets over the past year. These strategies are designed to take advantage of the volatility in the markets. Our special opportunities composite generated a gross return of 3.2% in the first quarter and 10% over the last 12 months. Our corporate private equity composite was down a modest 70 basis points in the quarter, but up more than 4% for the last 12 months. Within real estate, our US real estate equity composite gross return modestly declined 70 basis points for the quarter, but was up slightly over the last 12 months as cash flow growth was largely offset by increases in cap rates. Lastly, as we announced last quarter, we closed the purchase of the remaining 20% of Ares SSG's management business that we didn't already own. Our business across the region now has nearly 60 people in 8 offices managing approximately $12 billion in AUM. We hope to expand our geographic reach and product set across the Asia-Pacific region over time under a rebranded Ares Asia. We're investing and expanding our investment capabilities to mirror what we have in the US and Europe, including recent growth initiatives in real estate, growth equity, secondaries, alternative credit, and infrastructure. In addition to our regular quarterly materials, we posted a supplemental deck, which reclassifies historical financial results to reflect the Ares SSG business within our Credit Group. Since this business is now wholly owned by Ares, we include the former Ares SSG credit funds within our existing credit segment. Finally, before I pass the call back over to Mike, I wanted to reiterate that based on our fundraising and deployment outlook, we remain on track with our growth objectives and the financial guidance that we provided on our last earnings call. Mike? Sure. Thanks Ben. Great to hear from you. Yes, we still -- as I reiterated in my prepared remarks, we're still pretty confident about that end-of-the-year amount. I'll remind you and I touched on it a little bit in my comments, that we're still in the early stages of the harvest period and as we enter more into the later stages of the harvest period, that's when you are kind of removing that seasonality that we see. Right now, the seasonality means that we see larger tax-related payments that happened in the fourth quarter with a true-up to the tax actual payments that happened here in the second quarter. And so that's what drove my prepared remarks, but we still reiterated the guidance for this year. In terms of that long-term amount that we laid out for you and put into the presentation and you can find on our Investor Relations website, about 75% of that balance is from credit-oriented. So, the majority or the vast majority of it is really coming from our credit-oriented funds. So, that's what allows us to have that high predictability in terms of what we believe the balance will ultimately be. And it's always a little bit subjective in terms of when that will occur once you enter into that full harvest mode, but it becomes a much more predictable balance. Yes, absolutely. I'd say the one thing that's important to remember is that Q1 is always seasonally slow. And as we looked at Q4 of last year and coming into Q1, we were expecting a little bit of a slowdown time. And then you've always -- for the last few years, you've always had something happened in that February and March timeframe that's resulted in a little bit of slowness. We had the banking issues in that sector, which did create just a little bit of time. But overall, I think as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, you've seen our pipelines begin to build in direct lending. You've seen there's a little bit more activity that's beginning to happen. It's kind of what we see every year around this time, but it was overall a slower quarter, and that was in line with what we expected. Mike, do you want me to take that? Yes. Taking a look at that, it's really hard to predict because most of what we have in our investment income is a result of us seeding funds or our GP stakes in funds that ultimately weren't taken as employee co-invest. So, there is an episodic nature of when we recognize some things. Now, in terms of some of the vehicles that we have in there that are more debt-oriented, there is some expense that comes through just on the use of leverage that's in there and on the use of line fees. So, if we don't actually have a transaction that comes through, we still obviously have to pay that line fee. So, it is hard to predict from quarter-to-quarter what exactly that will be. We typically do have sales throughout every period, as Bill and Mike both mentioned earlier. As the market thaws or as there's an opportunity to sell assets, some of our more legacy funds may take advantage of that, but it's really hard to predict exactly when that will occur. Sure. So, we've made -- you can kind of quantify the investments in a number of different manners. Obviously, the acquisitions that we've had over the last couple of years are investments where we've used our balance sheet capital for that. And then there's also other investments, for example, taking a GP stake in new funds as you launch into a new strategy or you enter into a joint venture with a partner to launch that strategy.

            "name": "Bill Benjamin",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. I would be echoing much of what has been said already. I think that the biggest risk is the fundamentals in the office market, where we are, thankfully, on a global basis, very underexposed. It's less than 10% of our net asset value, and it's only 2% in the US, I believe. So, -- but the contraction of credit that was touched upon a few minutes ago, it will make our life a little bit more challenging for the next 24 to 36 months, but it will be an opportunity for our growing debt business. The milestones that we're looking for is a bottoming out on values. And I'm not sure we're there yet, and I don't want to call it, but what we're seeing are moderating. We're seeing discount rates and terminal cap rates in the third-party valuations. We are getting for much of our portfolio embedding a lot of equity risk premium. So, we think values are coming. And we want to see more realistic selling in the market. There's opportunistic purchases from funds that have gates coming down or at the end of their life, and sponsors are either very in the money or very out of the money. But we'd like to see a bit more liquidity in the market and realism in the sales market and then continued strong leasing in the sectors that Mike touched upon. We are to growing student exposure for both in the US and in Europe and leasing has done about now or a little bit earlier for the next academic year, and we are way, way ahead of where we've been in prior years. So, that's a sector that we are very bullish on as well. So, office fundamentals and availability of capital are the biggest risks, but the ability to use capital either in our debt or in structure subordinated equity positions in our other funds are going to create very good opportunities."

            "name": "Michael Arougheti",
            "content": "Thanks Carl. Good morning everyone. I hope everybody is doing well. Following a volatile 2022 in the equity and debt markets, transaction activity in the first quarter got off to a slow start and was uneven across various markets that we participate in. We began to see some signs of thawing as the quarter progressed, but the dislocation in the banking sector late in the quarter created considerable uncertainty about the banking system, the economy, and ultimately, the path of interest rates. Fortunately, for Ares, our asset-light business model tends to insulate us from balance sheet-driven volatility, and our long-term investment capital enables us to be opportunistic when other market participants retrench. For the first quarter, our business metrics continued to show strong year-over-year growth, and we're on track for a more significant fundraising year, with seven of our largest commingled funds expected in the market this year. In the first quarter, we raised $16 billion in new fund commitments and ended the quarter with $360 billion of AUM. We also generated strong year-over-year growth of 25% in management fees and 24% in fee-related earnings, while delivering a strong quarter of fund performance for our investors. Our first quarter realization activity was seasonally light, but our net accrued performance receivable continues to build. And we remain on track with our original European waterfall net realized performance income guidance for this year and next year, as Jarrod will discuss later. We continue to see robust investor demand for our alternative private capital offerings. In the market, we're observing a flight to larger, higher quality managers as investors are consolidating their allocations with preferred managers. Many of our largest funds with first closes are seeing significant commitments that represent half or more of the targeted fund size and the pipelines of investors working toward closing is encouraging. We also benefit from having a high re-up and crossover rate from existing investors. For the first quarter, over 90% of our $14 billion in direct capital raised was from existing Ares investors. As we outlined last quarter, we're actively raising our sixth European direct lending fund and our second alternative credit fund. For our sixth European direct lending fund, we've seen robust demand from investors and have accepted to-date, and anticipate through early Q2, subscriptions that will bring the total first close to more than $8.5 billion of LTV commitments. This amount includes subscriptions of $4.7 billion accepted through the end of the first quarter. We continue to see strong fundraising momentum for this fund and anticipate that at final close, the fund will exceed the predecessor fund, which had \u20ac11 billion of LP commitments and \u20ac15 billion in total capital, including fund leverage. Our second alternative credit fund is also seeing significant demand. As a reminder, our alternative credit strategy deploys flexible capital focused on large, diversified portfolios of assets that generate contractual cash flows. We've accepted subscriptions to date and anticipate, through May, a total first close of approximately $3.5 billion. This includes $1.8 billion of commitments closed through the end of the first quarter. With the robust demand for this fund, we expect commitments to this fund to easily exceed that of its predecessor, which totaled $3.7 billion and we're targeting a final close later this year. This fund, like its predecessor fund, carries a unique charitable endeavor tied to our performance fees, where 10% of the carried interest for closed-end and 5% of the incentive fee for the open-end fund will be donated to support global health and education initiatives. These contributions are split equally between our investment team and Ares. Inclusive of the fund's first closing, the alternative credit platform will have over $10.5 billion of capital designated with this charitable tie-in. And based upon performance to-date, our predecessor alternative credit funds have already reached approximately $10 million for potential charitable donations. In our secondaries business, we entered into a credit secondaries joint venture with a large strategic investor with initial capital of approximately $1 billion. We believe that this well positions us to be a market leader in the growing credit secondary sector, particularly due to our leading private credit franchise, knowledge, insights, and relationships with middle-market companies and sponsors. We intend to further scale our presence in this new strategy with the recent launch of our first credit secondaries commingled fund, with the first close expected later this year. This is another great example of the types of product extensions and growth that we can bring to acquired platforms shortly after acquisition. With respect to our other fundraisers, we're on track to hold a sizable first closing for our third US senior direct lending fund, either late Q2 or early Q3. As a reminder, our second fund had $8 billion in LP commitments and approximately $14 billion in total capital, including fund leverage. We also anticipate first closes for our second climate infrastructure fund, our third infrastructure secondaries fund, and our seventh corporate private equity fund over the next several quarters. Later this year, we expect to launch our third US junior capital direct lending fund, with the first closing expected early next year. And overall, we expect to have nearly 30 different co-mingled and perpetual capital fund offerings in the market this year, in addition to our managed accounts and CLOs. Finally, last week, we priced the IPO of our second SPAC, Ares Acquisition Corp. II. We saw significant demand for the offering, with the $400 million base deal upsized to $450 million. The underwriters partially exercised their over-allotment option to get to a final close of $500 million. At the end of the closing, AAC was the second largest US IPO this year and the largest SPAC IPO since January of 2022. And we believe that this is a strong validation of our differentiated platform and approach to this asset class. With our strong initial investor demand and robust fundraising pipeline, we're already seeing a rebuilding of our shadow AUM, which increased from $42 billion at year-end to over $50 billion at quarter end. With our positive outlook for continued fundraising strength in the coming quarters, we expect to see further increases in our available capital, enabling us to be more opportunistic with our deployment in what we believe is an attractive investment environment. In the wealth management channel, we're excited to announce that we've recently launched our non-traded BDC, Ares Strategic Income Fund, or ASIF. We also remain on track to continue adding distribution partners for our US products, and we're expanding our retail distribution and products globally, including planned dedicated vehicles targeting the European and Asian regions later this year to take advantage of our credit expertise. While we, like others, continue to experience slower flows into our two non-traded REITs, unlike others, our net inflows remained positive in the first quarter with a combined approximately $350 million of gross quarterly proceeds, inclusive of our 1031 Exchange program versus approximately $200 million of quarterly redemption requests. We believe that success in the retail market will ultimately gravitate to a handful of all players that have attractive products across all the private asset classes, a global presence and large distribution and service teams who can provide education and thought leadership to financial advisers and their clients. With our continued expansion in products and distribution and the launch of our retail education portal, Access Ares, in June, we believe that we're cementing Ares as one of the leaders in the alternative retail market. From a deployment perspective, the first quarter was, as expected, slower across many of our strategies due to typical seasonal factors and decreased market activity. That said, the $12.9 billion of gross deployment in the quarter was in line with our internal expectations at the beginning of the year, and we remain on track with our growth objectives for fee-paying AUM for the year. We believe that our private credit strategies are taking market share in a smaller pool of transaction opportunities and we expect that this will pay dividends as more issuers and sponsors experience the benefit and reliability of our flexible capital solutions. Our pipelines are building in our more opportunistic strategies that often see higher deployment in dislocated markets. In alternative credit, the investment pipeline is very strong, as our team is seeing numerous opportunities out of the regional banks, including asset portfolio sales and regulatory capital trades, in addition to their normal pipeline of asset-backed transactions. In our Private Equity Group, our special opportunities team has seen a significant pickup in their pipeline as banks and other traditional providers retreat from the market. We're seeing a growing number of opportunities from companies that need solutions as they struggle to amend and extend their capital structures. In real estate, we're starting to see compelling opportunities from fund complexes that need liquidity to meet redemption requests. The most interesting opportunities currently in the pipeline are in the debt markets, where we can step into the funding gap for refinancing opportunities and provide fresh capital on a structured basis. In direct lending, we're beginning to see more deal activity and some larger transaction opportunities, which should set us up for an increase in deployment in the second quarter. The expected investment returns for this vintage of private credit are attractive with meaningfully improved terms, more conservative capital structures, higher base rates, and significant excess credit spreads. In our secondaries business, we're seeing a growing number of both LP and GP-led opportunities as certain LPs seek liquidity and certain fund sponsors look to accelerate liquidity into legacy fund vehicles. So, overall, we have many strategies that can take advantage of constrained liquidity in the market. With $88.6 billion of available capital and additional closes for several of our large commingled products in the coming months, we expect to have a strong capital base to take advantage of the market opportunities for our clients. This is also a very attractive environment for our affiliated insurance platform to be building its annuity origination business. We now have over $7.5 billion of AUM at Aspida, and over 95% of the portfolio is protected from surrender charges and without the issues associated with a large legacy book. Going forward, we expect to continue to raise third-party capital to further scale our affiliated insurance platform. We believe the strong secular growth that we continue to experience across our business is ultimately result of our strong and consistent fund performance. Our funds' portfolios are generally continuing to see cash flow growth with positive fundamentals. Despite higher interest rates flowing through to our portfolio companies, we continue to see solid cash flow growth, low defaults, and resilience in our credit metrics. For example, our US and European direct lending portfolios continue to see mid- to high single-digit year-over-year EBITDA growth. In direct lending, our loan-to-value statistics remained steady between 43% and 50% for the US and Europe. At Ares Capital Corporation, which is a good proxy for our US direct lending business, non-accruals totaled 2.3% of the portfolio at cost and 1.3% at fair value, which continue to be below our 15-year historical averages. These credit metrics remain at benign levels despite the significant increase in base rates. As a result, our direct lending funds have experienced a significant increase in coupons with a de minimis offset from credit-related issues. Our global real estate portfolio continues to see strong, but moderating rental growth and high occupancy rates. Our highest conviction sectors of industrial and multifamily account for more than 75% of the portfolio's gross assets, with another 12% invested in our favored alternative sectors, including self-storage, triple net lease, and single-family rental. In industrial, on a same-store comparable basis, we saw rent growth of approximately 70% over the last 12 months and more than 90% tenant retention across our industrial portfolio. In multifamily, our same-store re-leasing spreads continue to see 10%-or-better annual growth over the last 12 months. From an allocation standpoint, we continue to be meaningfully underweight to office, retail, and hospitality assets. Our US office equity exposure is only 2% of our global real estate portfolio. And lastly, in our private equity group, our corporate PE portfolio continues to perform well as year-over-year EBITDA increased 10%, including growth supported by accretive acquisitions and synergies. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Jarrod for comments on our financials and additional details on the performance of our funds. Jarrod? Thanks Jarrod. In 2022, we focused on investing in the talent and the infrastructure needed to support our significant fundraising and deployment ambitions for the next several years. This year, we're now focused on executing on these goals, and we're off to a great start with several of our important fundraises, which we believe will set us up for strong growth for the remainder of this year and beyond. We've also made great strides in broadening our product suite, both organically and through strategic acquisitions over the past few years. We're pleased to have fully integrated these acquired platforms, and we're on plan with our strategic and financial objectives. We're now in the process of scaling these businesses with new products and other synergies. We've already executed on several of our growth objectives, including the launch of our Australian direct lending and credit secondary strategies in the institutional channel, along with the formation of AWMS and the launches of our private markets fund and our nontraded BDC in the wealth channel. We also have exciting growth plans for our infrastructure debt strategy. So, in conclusion, we believe that our business is well positioned to take advantage of the volatile market backdrop. Looking at our historical performance, some of the fastest periods of our growth have come during recessions and market dislocations. I believe that we're better equipped than ever as we potentially approach another similar period. Currently, we have more available capital, a larger team and more tools in our toolbox, which we believe positions us well to take advantage of the many opportunities that we expect to see in this market environment. Our long-term capital flexibility and scale, asset-light balance sheet, and robust investment in portfolio management capabilities puts us in the position to be opportunistic when others cannot. As always, I'm grateful for the hard work and dedication of our team, and I'm appreciative of our investors' continuing support for our company. And operator, I think we can now open up the line for questions. Sure. Obviously, we don't comment on specific funds in the market. So, maybe, I'll just give you a couple of themes to think about. Obviously, you saw what we accomplished in our core commingled credit funds with some pretty meaningful and quick first closes relative to prior fund size for the alternative credit vehicle as well as the European credit vehicle. And as we talked about in the prepared remarks, 90% of the commitments that came in, in the quarter were from existings. So, that should give you a pretty good indication for the re-up appetite and the receptivity from our existings. Also, you saw just since quarter end, in those two funds alone, we brought in commitments of an additional $5 billion plus. And so that momentum continues. I would say, generally speaking, all things private credit are being very well received, not surprisingly, given the defensive positioning of the asset class to benefit from rising interest rates, the ability to deploy more actively in a lower transaction environment. And I would, again, expect that to continue, both for institutional and retail. We are seeing from investors, I don't know if I would call it reduced appetite for private equity, but reduced ability to invest in pure regular way private equity. And what I mean by that would just be non-differentiated growth buyout. And that's largely a function of the transaction environment money not coming back to those LPs and therefore, denominator effect. We're still in the early days of our private equity fund raise, but I would remind you that we have a pretty differentiated approach. Obviously, we've been in that business for over 20 years with a consistent track record, but we do have a distress for control capability in that fund, and that fund actively invests alongside our successful SOF franchise. And so our expectation and hope are that, given the ability for that strategy to play distressed and opportunistic the way a lot of our credit strategies are that we'll have a differentiated experience, but still too early to tell. It's a good question. We've actually -- we saw really good inflows on our liquid credit business in the first quarter. So, I think to your point, people do see the value opportunity in the liquid credit markets. I'd also point out, if you look at our core private credit funds, ASOF, Pathfinder, even ARCC, those funds all have the ability to flex between liquid and illiquid. And so you should expect that when the public markets are offering significantly better value, we'll be spending time there and then obviously harvesting those gains to redeploy into the private side of the house when that deployment opportunity picks up. So, there is a fair amount of dynamism in the existing \"private funds\" that are taking advantage of that liquid market opportunity. And I think our investors see that, and that's reflected in the fundraising as well. Thanks Craig. Yes, it's a good question, Adam. And again, we've -- I think we're fortunate and differentiated from some of the peers and that we are continuing to see net flows in both the REIT complex as well as the credit interval fund. And as we highlighted, we have recently launched our non-traded BDC with $1.5 billion of capital, and we're bringing that into the retail channel in the back half of the year and expect healthy demand there. So, seeing the flows, it would tell you that the appetite within the channel for alt is still intact. And we do know that in talking to the top of the house at most of the large wealth and RIA platforms, that the desire to grow alt exposure is also intact. So, when you look at what's going on, I -- we never really know the motivation for redemption. I think some of the early redemptions we saw in peer portfolios was less a comment on the market and more that some of those folks owned the REIT shares on leverage and they were getting redeemed, and there was a little bit of leverage unwind coming out of certain geographies. I think now it's probably a combination of the two things that you highlighted, Adam, which is just a general commentary on perceived risk and opportunity in the commercial real estate market and obviously, client liquidity. But I can't apportion the outflows to those two in any quantitative way, but I think those are definitely at play. I will say, just looking at some of the peer data and the market data, it does appear that some of those outflows are slowing. And I think when we get to stabilized rates and stabilized cap rates, that you'd hopefully see that trend reverse. So, I think one of the things that we've tried to articulate, but I don't know if it's appreciated, is one of the benefits of the way that we've organically built the Aspida platform, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, is we're not dealing with surrenders or legacy book challenges. But we also have a fully tech-enabled paperless insurance platform, which actually is pretty efficient in terms of managing annuity sales and scaling. Telling you what you probably know, we have the ability to accelerate or moderate sales based on price and structure of the product offering. And depending on where we are in terms of our deployment or a view on the yield opportunity on the asset side, we'll push and pull on it. But to give you some perspective, in the first quarter, we were doing about $600 million per month in new annuity sales, just to give you a sense for capacity on the platform in this type of market environment. It's a great question and obviously, this is purely us speculating, but it's informed by what we've seen in prior cycles. The first phase of this, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, is that we are seeing a very healthy amount of pipeline building with the banks themselves as our counterparty on portfolio sales, red cap trades and various other things just as they navigate the current environment. The biggest beneficiary of this first phase is our alternative credit business. As the banks, both being in small, retreat to kind of their core businesses and exit large portions of the market, I think that will create opportunity in the primary market for alt credit. And I'd put that probably at the top of the list of growth opportunity coming out of this. That being said, when you think about bank behavior and credit contraction, commercial real estate lending, I think, will be a significant beneficiary. I think telling you what you know, Alex, if you look at commercial real estate exposure, 70% of commercial real estate loans are held in the banking system. And on average, 40% of regional bank balance sheets are commercial real estate loan exposures. And so if there is credit contraction and stress at the property level, I think that's going to open up a pretty big opportunity for us globally in and around the commercial real estate lending business. Needless to say, as the larger banks maybe reduce focus or have the inability to be as aggressive as they have been on the leverage finance side of the house, big beneficiaries there are our SOF franchise and our direct lending franchise. And then I would also just highlight, generally, given the position of our private equity business, both ACOF and ASOF as we begin to see capital structure distress and operating distress, they're going to be big beneficiaries as well. So, I kind of just mentioned all of our strategies. Now, that I think about it, I would say some are going to have more direct benefit, but I think this credit contraction is real, and I think it's going to really drive more capital into the hands of folks like us. Sure. So, the bulk of that business was the Landmark acquisition. We're now two years removed from closing. That's been fully integrated, what I would say, retooled from a product standpoint, and now we've begun to innovate and grow. So, the two big new products coming off of that platform are our PMS fund, our private markets fund, which is our first private equity-oriented product that we put into the wealth channel, and we have high hopes for the long-term growth opportunity there. And two, is the launch of our credited secondaries business, which was always a very big motivator behind the big push into the secondaries market. Interesting, when you just look at the acquisition, we kind of acquired the current vintage of PE fund midstream, and we're now deploying our 17 fund that was kind of raised during the acquisition and initial integration period, and we are currently capital raising for our real estate and infra strategies as well. So, we're in capital formation mode. And then obviously, as we begin to have closings on those, you'll begin to see the revenue begin to tick up, both on committed capital and invested capital for the credit strategies. The reason we're so optimistic there is back to this overarching theme of capital constraint illiquidity and denominator effect, we are seeing LPs seriously look at liquidity in the secondary market. I would expect that 2023 will likely be a record year for LP-led secondaries, just based on what we're seeing year-to-date and the way the pipeline is developing. But needless to say, the pricing in that market is more attractive than it's been in a long time, and we're seeing the market bid kind of 85, 90 for PE and maybe 70, 75 for venture. So, there's a real value opportunity there. And then on the GP side, for those GPs that are in between funds are experiencing a slower capital raise for their next fund getting into the GP-led side of the house with things like continuation funds and NAV loans, we think, is going to turn on in earnest as well, and that's -- that pipeline is building. So, I think the supply-demand dynamic in that market is extraordinarily good. Sure. It's an astute question. We do borrow from the banks. Probably 60% to 65% of where we borrow is to leverage our private credit portfolios. And similarly, I'd probably venture to say 60% to 65% of that borrower is from the G-SIBs. I think in markets like this, as we consolidate share, I think you're going to see the G-SIB consolidate share as well and probably do more business with the larger platforms. So, my hope is that even with overall shrinking of capital availability, that Ares and those like us will get a disproportionate share of that balance sheet. The implication, though, is that if that leverage is not available, obviously, given the return expectations of our investors, that just means higher unlevered ROAs in the market, which means valuations need to continue to come down to meet that market reality, which is obviously deflationary. And I would say the same for just the basic capital constraint that we already talked about. Obviously, I don't think that the private markets can absorb the entirety of that channel, nor should they. Obviously, we live symbiotically with the banks as partners in a lot of the things that we do. But if you look at C&I loans across the entire banking landscape, they're pushing $3 trillion today. And if you look at private credit installed base in the US market, it's about $1 trillion. So, there's going to need to be a pretty significant amount of capital formation in order for the private markets to really fill the void if it's significant. So, it could challenge the economy. I think the flip side of that is obviously, the private markets will get an opportunity to be extremely selective in the risks that they want to take and what they want to get paid for that risk if capital is scarce. And I think that's one of the reasons why we're so excited about the backdrop. I would expect that we're going to get higher risk-adjusted returns for higher quality borrowers and assets that we've seen in a long time. I'll give you my thoughts. Bill Benjamin, our Global Head of Real Estate, is on as well, so he could probably do a deeper dive. But I think you have to -- you can't look at all segments of commercial real estate as equal, and you can't look at the geographies the same way either. So, obviously, office is severely challenged right now. Whereas as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, industrial and most of the multifamily sectors that we're participating in are still seeing good fundamental strength. Europe is showing some differentiation from the US, European office. We're not quite seeing the same work-from-home stresses and supply-demand imbalances there. European retail actually starting to get a little bit more interesting. So, there's also a bifurcation between US and Europe. I think the biggest issue, frankly, is you have a broadly leveraged asset class with base rates that are up 500 basis points. And so you're seeing, and we see this in our primary market, unlevered debt yields in that market, 9.5%, 10% plus, and that just becomes really difficult to support if you're an equity owner of a challenged piece of real estate and, obviously, has a pretty significant implication for future value. So, that market is going to have to go through a pretty significant period of repricing and deleveraging. There are a handful of maturities that are going to be coming up here in the next 12 to 24 months that will continue to stress the market. But Bill, I'll kick it to you to tack on to that as... Thanks Bill. Yes, I think you have to find the signal through the noise, because there's a lot of folks that are hanging a shingle in the private credit space that are not really forming capital of any significance or building the necessary origination investment and portfolio management infrastructure to scale. And so I think the large entrenched players are the players and there will be some folks that nibble around the edges. But I would say from a competitive set, we're not seeing significant new entrants taking share. We have a number of entrenched competitors that are undercapitalized right now. So, we're actually seeing some reduced capital in the market, which we think will benefit us given where we are in our fundraising cycle. But yes, I would say not a significant change, and this is not a market that you just jump into, right? If you look at what we've been building here over the last 20-plus years, in our US business, we have 180 people. We're actively calling on 500 private equity sponsors in our private credit direct lending business. We've deployed over $100 billion with incredible performance. You can't really replicate that, both from a track record relationship and expense standpoint. So, as I said earlier, I would expect that market share will continue to consolidate behind the scale players, like it has in every other cycle that we've experienced. And I would highlight that, that's true in Europe as well, where we probably have an even greater leadership position across the private credit landscape. Yes. So, again, too early to tell. We took the approach of seeding the fund to get it scaled. So, that when we took it into the wealth channel, people would see the portfolio, and we would not have to deal with any meaningful J curve issue as we supported the growing dividend there. So, as we talked about, we have $1.5 billion of capital already in there through the seeding of that fund. It formally launched a week ago. And as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we have our first retail distribution partner coming online in Q2. And so I think on the next earnings call, we'll have a better sense for kind of what the steady-state demand is out of that first distribution partner. But again, if you believe that private credit is in demand and that the wealth channel is under allocated to private credit similar to the institutions. I think given our brand and given the track record of performance that we've demonstrated in ARCC over the last 19 years, that the demand will be there. But we'll have a much better sense the next time we're all together once we get the product into the channel. Go ahead. Go ahead, Jarrod. I'll chime in after. Go ahead. Sure. So, I don't know how to say aggressive. And I think if you look at the size and scale of those businesses, obviously, there's a pretty consistent amount of deployment. So, if you look, year-on-year LTM deployment for US direct lending was $32 billion in 2022. It's about $25 billion right now. European was $12 billion. Now, it's close to $14 billion. So, that's showing a little bit of growth. But those businesses are at a scale now where there's some pretty steady deployment. And we've talked about this before, 50% or so of deployment opportunities in those businesses is coming from within the existing portfolio, either as companies deleverage and look to re-leverage, execute on a growth plan, go through a change of ownership. So, there's an embedded pipeline of opportunity just given the size and diversification that exists in the existing portfolios. The market is definitely coming our way. And so I think as we scale capital, that should also have the impact of scaling deployment. So, as we're getting these funds into the market and having successful closings, that sets us up to be a little more \"aggressive\" as you said on the deployment side as well. Yes, I would say US and Europe are kind of in line right now in terms of the structure of new loans and the risk return that we're generating and the performance of the existing portfolios. So, we're pleased with the consistency. Particularly, I think some of the concerns that folks were having around more challenging economic backdrop in the Eurozone, we're just not seeing that roll through the portfolios or the transaction activity. Just to put things in perspective, which is why people are so excited, most new loans in those markets are getting priced on a first-lien basis, somewhere between SOFR 5.50% and 5.75% at lower attachment points and better structures with three points of fee and some modest call protection, in many cases. So, back-of-the-envelope math is pretty high quality. First-lien loan is getting priced in the 11.5% to 12% range. And then obviously, to the extent that, that bleeds into second lien or unitranche or now into the mid-teens unlevered. So, it's pretty compelling, particularly in a market where it's just difficult to price equity risk. Asia-Pacific, it's hard to say because it's different by country and by region. I'd say the regular way acquisition finance business in Australia and New Zealand, which is a more mature capital market and buyout market, we're seeing similar types of trends, both on credit and deployment. And then I would say, in other parts of the market, it's much more of a special sits and opportunistic credit play, which really speaks to the strength of the legacy SSG team over there. So, the APAC opportunity, it's not as robust from an [Indiscernible] standpoint, but probably offering more consistent, opportunistic plays across the region. Thanks. Yes, if you want. I can chime in after this. Look, your crystal ball is as good as ours. I think real estate -- again, certain sectors of real estate is probably the easiest to see, just given the leverage profile and debt yields in that market. I think we could see a weakening of kind of lower end of the consumer market. I don't think we have exposure there, but that could present some opportunities in our alt credit business. Kind of on the middle market side, as I said, we're just not really seeing -- we're not seeing it. We had 8% EBITDA growth in our ARCC book, which again is a good proxy for the US direct lending business. In our private equity franchise, we saw 5% to 10% EBITDA growth. So, the earnings are coming through. I think some of the inflationary pressures are abating. And if you look at the stresses in the corporate market right now, it's really about over-levered balance sheets and a 500 basis point increase in base rates in 12 months, more than it's about earnings recession. And for better or for worse, we've been the big beneficiary of that increase in base rates. And so when we're coming to the table, talking to our partners on the equity side as a counterparty on a loan, it's typically around how do we relieve cash burden of the capital structure in exchange for other compensation. But it is a different set up than we've seen in prior cycles where typically, when we're talking about defaults, earnings are falling out of bed and rates are coming down. So, we're giving away return while we're dealing with operational distress. And most of the conversations now are really about just capital structure flexibility and the inability for folks to service their existing capital structures. And that's an easier conversation. Frankly, it's an easier risk to box right now, and that's generally what the conversations have been on the bulk of the corporate loan book. Sure. Thanks. I don't have any other than just want to thank everybody for their time today and look forward to speaking again in a couple of months and hopefully have some great updates. Talk to everybody soon. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Friday, November 1, 2024. I will now turn the call over to Greg Mason, Co-Head of Public Markets, Investor Relations for Ares Management.\nGreg Mason: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for our third quarter conference call. Speaking on the call today will be Michael Arougheti, our Chief Executive Officer; and Jarrod Phillips, our Chief Financial Officer. We also have several executives with us today who will be available during the Q&A session. Before we begin, I want to remind you that comments made during this call contain forward-looking statements and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those identified in our risk factors in our SEC filings. Our actual results could differ materially, and we undertake no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Please also note that past performance is not a guarantee of future results and nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in Ares or any Ares Fund.\nGreg Mason: During this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Please refer to our third quarter earnings presentation available on the Investor Resources section of our website for reconciliations of the measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Note that we plan to file our Form 10-Q later this month. This morning, we announced that we declared our fourth quarter common dividend of $0.93 per share on the company's Class A and nonvoting common stock, representing an increase of 21% over our dividend for the same quarter a year ago. The dividend will be paid on December 31, 2024, to holders of record on December 17. Now I'll turn the call over to Michael Arougheti, who will start with some quarterly business and financial highlights.\nMichael Arougheti: Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everybody. I hope you are all doing well. During the third quarter, the macroeconomic backdrop for our business remains constructive, as we continue to see fundraising momentum, modestly improving transaction activity, and solid fundamental performance in our underlying investment portfolios. Lower short-term rates are starting to have a positive impact, leading to higher valuations for rate-sensitive assets and increasing real estate transaction activity. The more supportive market tone is showing up in the strength of our pipelines across the firm, and we are optimistic that we will see increasing transaction volumes over the coming year as the expected rate-cutting cycle progresses.\nMichael Arougheti: During the third quarter, we generated strong year-over-year growth across our financial metrics, including 18% growth in management fees, 24% growth in fee-related earnings, and 28% growth in our realized income. This growth was supported by global deployment of nearly $30 billion, which is our second-highest quarter on record. This brings year-to-date deployment to $74.6 billion and should set 2024 up to be a record year. In addition, we raised nearly $21 billion of gross capital during the third quarter. With over $64 billion raised year-to-date, we are also now tracking to have our best year ever for fundraising. We are poised for strong future deployment due to our record level of available capital and an expectation that an improving market will broaden out and strengthen our deployment across even more strategies over the next year. Our fundraising success this year is in part due to the heightened institutional and retail investor demand that we are seeing across our private credit strategies, including global direct lending, alternative credit, real estate debt, and infrastructure debt as well as strong interest in our liquid credit strategies.\nMichael Arougheti: While reported private credit fundraising in the market has declined for three years straight, we believe that our differentiated experience is a testament to our market-leading position and long-dated performance through multiple cycles. Investors continue to prioritize investments that can generate durable yield and excess return over the traded market equivalents regardless of the absolute level of interest rates. We are also seeing strong interest in a variety of secondary strategies and improving interest in real assets. In the third quarter, we raised $20.9 billion in gross new capital, including more than $13.5 billion across our private credit strategies. Over the past 12 months, we have raised more than $57 billion in our private credit strategies. To touch on a few fundraising highlights in the credit business: In the third quarter, we raised $2.8 billion of equity and debt commitments in a final close for SDL III, our third U.S. senior direct lending fund. We expect SDL III will have approximately $34 billion of investment capacity, including related vehicles and anticipated leverage. This amount is nearly double the size of our second vintage and reflects our leading franchise in U.S. direct lending. We are already well underway investing in this third fund, which currently has $11 billion committed across 195 companies. In the third quarter, we also closed on approximately EUR 2 billion of equity investments in our sixth European Direct Lending Fund, bringing total LP commitments to date to approximately $14.5 billion compared to EUR 11 billion for the prior vintage. We anticipate holding a final close for this fund in the fourth quarter, and we believe that this will be the largest European direct lending fund ever raised in the market. We have called more than EUR 3 billion of capital for the fund and are well on our way to building a well-diversified portfolio.\nMichael Arougheti: In terms of new fund launches, we recently launched the third vintage of our special opportunities fund and expect the first close beginning later in this fourth quarter. We are also working on a number of new products around our sports, media, and entertainment strategy, including both open- and closed-end products for institutional and retail investors. We are seeing significant demand from investors seeking access to the growing and differentiated value for various sports-related franchises. Our team was an early pioneer in this strategy and has become a trusted partner in a large addressable market, which we estimate is more than $750 billion, as professional sports leagues around the globe continue to open up to institutional capital. Fundraising for the third quarter totaled $2.9 billion, including a final close for our fourth U.S. Real Estate Opportunity Fund, which brought the fund and related vehicles to $3.3 billion, a 50% increase over the previous vintage. Our ability to meaningfully scale this latest vintage in a challenging real estate fundraising environment reflects our leading real estate franchise and the relative performance that we have delivered for investors. During the quarter, we completed the first close for our fourth European value-add real estate fund totaling $1 billion, and we are on pace to exceed the previous vintage, which raised EUR 1.5 billion. And finally, in real estate, with less aggressive competition from the banks and increasingly attractive risk-adjusted opportunities in debt, we continue to see strong demand across our real estate debt strategies as evidenced by the $1.2 billion that we raised in the quarter, including over $850 million in European real estate debt.\nMichael Arougheti: We are also seeing strong momentum across our secondaries group, as we scale existing strategies and launch new fund series. For example, we recently launched a secondaries product focused on global structured solutions, which seeks to provide financing directly to the general partners of private funds. The fund and related vehicles will soon hold its first close with approximately $700 million in equity commitments, which is already 70% of the fund's initial $1 billion target. We are also actively scaling the third vintage of our infrastructure secondaries fund, and we expect to raise nearly $400 million shortly, which would bring the fund and related vehicles to approximately $1.4 billion in equity commitments or more than 40% larger than the previous vintage. Our new credit secondaries business is also seeing significant momentum, and the team recently completed Ares' largest credit secondaries transaction to date, a $500 million highly diversified portfolio of credit secondaries fund stakes. The secondaries market is a promising area for Ares when you match the growing need for liquidity with our more than 1,000 sponsor and 2,600 institutional investor relationships around the globe. As many of you know, we continue to be a leader in the wealth channel with accelerating momentum and an expanding product suite. Our solutions offer individual investors core private markets exposure delivering durable income, diversified equity, and tax-advantaged real assets to the wealth channel globally.\nMichael Arougheti: During the third quarter, we raised over $2.5 billion of equity commitments and nearly $4 billion in total AUM, including leveraging our semi-liquid well products. Through the third quarter, our year-to-date equity flows into wealth management products totaled over $7 billion, which is more than 3x the fundraising pace over the same period last year. Including leverage, we have raised over $11 billion in wealth management AUM through September 30, and momentum has continued into the fourth quarter. We recently launched our seventh wealth management product, a tax-efficient core infrastructure fund, which successfully raised an initial $400 million in equity commitments in September and October. And lastly, October was our largest fundraising month to date with approximately $1.2 billion in equity flows across our semi-liquid wealth products. We continue to make meaningful progress expanding our distribution partnerships. We are now on 60 platforms, up 50% in the past year, and we continue to see our products gain traction across the U.S. wirehouses, private banks, RIAs, and other distribution platforms globally. We are pleased with the international expansion of the wealth distribution as 37% of year-to-date inflows are from outside the U.S. And in total, we have over $32 billion of AUM across our semi-liquid wealth management products, which is a 57% increase from a year ago.\nMichael Arougheti: When combining AUM from our publicly traded vehicles and high-net-worth investors in our campaign funds, our total AUM from the retail channel exceeds $88 billion. For the full year, we now expect to end 2024 with total gross capital raised in the mid $80 billion range, well above our 2021 record of $77 billion. Campaign funds or institutional closed-end funds have accounted for approximately 1/3 of fundraising year-to-date, while SMAs, wealth management, public funds, and Aspida accounted for over 50%. We expect our fundraising activities for the remainder of the year and into 2025 to consist of more than 35 active funds, including 15 different campaign funds along with continued inflows into our perpetual funds and SMAs, CLOs, and through Aspida, our growing insurance affiliate.\nMichael Arougheti: Turning to our investing activities. New issue activity has moderately improved from earlier this year. This has driven a higher gross to net deployment ratio for our private credit strategies, which totaled 42% for the third quarter, an improvement over last quarter's 38% and up from 28% in the first quarter. In U.S. and European direct lending, we invested nearly $16 billion of gross commitments in the quarter across more than 100 companies with net deployment totaling nearly $7 billion. Given the breadth of our origination capabilities, we invest across the spectrum of middle-market companies, including an increased focus on core and lower middle market opportunities due to the superior relative value currently available in those market segments. We also leveraged our incumbency to extend and expand our relationships with many of our strongest borrowers. During the third quarter, approximately 60% of our U.S. direct lending deployment was with existing borrowers, and we roughly doubled our dollar commitments to these portfolio companies. We believe this illustrates the power of our incumbency and our ability to grow alongside our best-performing portfolio companies. By focusing on the lower and core middle markets, we can generate higher risk-adjusted returns with broader coverage and can establish relationships with companies earlier in their growth phases. With an alternative credit, we deployed nearly $3.8 billion in the third quarter, an increase of more than 35% compared to the same quarter last year. With over $40 billion in AUM and a team of 75 investment professionals focusing on both the liquid and illiquid sectors, we believe that we are the largest manager in the higher returning illiquid asset-based credit segment with approximately $22 billion of nonrated AUM.\nMichael Arougheti: While our team has deep experience with over 30 asset classes in the U.S. and Europe, we focus on investing in relative value, which enables us to hone in on certain asset buses in favor and where scaled capital is required. Most recently, our team has been active across fund finance, residential assets, auto leases, digital infrastructure, and asset management. A couple of great examples include our $1.5 billion joint venture with CAL Automotive for prime auto leases and our role in leading a GBP 755 million preferred equity commitment for Wembley Park, which is a mixed-use neighborhood in London. In addition, our alternative credit team continues to partner directly with banks on a bilateral basis to provide capital relief solutions, including the recent financing agreement that we announced with Investec Bank. It's important to note, though, that we are continuing to scale our $19 billion of liquid investment-grade rated AUM through partnerships with third-party insurance companies and Aspida. We are seeing significant growth in our liquid investment-grade asset-backed segment, which has increased at a 36% CAGR over the past 5 years. In addition, Aspida continues to generate strong organic growth with more than $2 billion in fixed annuity originations and reinsurance flows in the third quarter, and we expect continuing strong flows in the fourth quarter. Within the real asset markets, we are at a meaningful inflection point with rising transaction activity, strong fundamental performance, and promising supply-demand dynamics on the horizon.\nMichael Arougheti: Across our real estate strategies, we invested more than $2 billion in the third quarter, which was up meaningfully versus the same period a year ago, with a continued emphasis on our highest conviction sectors, including industrial, multifamily, student housing, and single-family rental. Within our Infrastructure segment, we continue to focus on renewable energy and related digital infrastructure investments. And before I provide an update on our recent transaction announcements, I want to take a minute to highlight the long-term growth opportunities that we see in the global industrial real estate, digital infrastructure, and clean energy sectors. Over the past decade, we have been expanding our investment capabilities and capital base in the industrial and renewable energy markets to take advantage of rising demand in e-commerce, the reorganization of global supply chains, infrastructure for AI, the demand for clean energy, and manufacturing reshoring, which is reversing more than four decades of globalizing trade. For instance, estimates suggest that the reshoring of manufacturing will require over 1 billion square feet of logistics support in the next decade. And by 2030, the U.S. will need up to 250 terawatt hours of new energy production to support AI and the expanded manufacturing base. As an example, Ares made a strategic investment in X-Energy, which is developing and building fourth generation of small modular reactors or SMRs. Recently, X-Energy announced that several strategic partners led by Amazon, invested approximately $500 million in a new financing round for the company. Both Amazon and X-Energy, along with existing investors such as Dow and Ares, are seeking to advance the largest deployment to date of safe, clean, and reliable SMR nuclear power aimed at the growing digital and manufacturing economies in the U.S.\nMichael Arougheti: Now with that perspective, I'd like to reemphasize the strategic importance of our two recently announced acquisitions and real assets, which we believe will not only diversify our business mix but also enhance our growth profile. The GCP International transaction enables us to expand into three critical areas of importance for our firm. First, it expands our real assets presence in the strategically important APAC region, including in Japan and Vietnam within many of our highest conviction sectors like industrial, digital infrastructure, and clean energy. Following our SSG acquisition in 2020 and Crescent Point last year, we have been strategically evaluating inorganic growth opportunities in the region, and GCP International scale, asset positioning, track record, and team represented far and away the most compelling opportunity of the nearly 40 managers that we considered. Second, the transaction expands our vertically integrated industrial real estate capabilities into Japan, Europe, Vietnam, and Brazil. As one of the largest vertically integrated industrial players in the U.S., we believe that expanding our vertical capabilities globally will enhance our value proposition to our LPs and other market participants while enabling us to create new revenue streams as these businesses scale. Third, we are gaining a global presence in a rapidly growing data center development and asset management business with a $7 billion near-term development pipeline, which complements our existing climate infrastructure capabilities. And while I focus on just these three opportunities, there are many more compelling growth and synergy opportunities that GCP International presents, and we believe that we are buying at an opportune time in the real estate cycle with a manager that provides significant growth potential.\nMichael Arougheti: You may have also seen that we signed an agreement to purchase Walton Street Mexico, an industrial-focused real estate manager with $2.1 billion in AUM as of June 30. This transaction enables us to capitalize on the nearshoring trends that we are seeing across supply chains, and the Walton Street Mexico team is particularly well-positioned to take advantage of this market opportunity. We believe that there are also intriguing synergies with their institutional client base for other Ares products. In both of these cases, we had long-standing relationships with certain principles of these firms, and we believe that each team will be a great cultural fit. Clearly, the addition of these two firms will provide important scale to our Real Assets group and makes us one of the leading players in private equity real estate across the globe. And I'll now turn the call over to Jarrod to discuss our financial results in more detail. Jarrod?\nJarrod Phillips: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, we continued to deliver strong results with high-teens year-over-year growth in AUM and management fees and mid-20s growth in FRE and Real Asset income. With $64 billion already raised this year and more than $74 billion in gross deployment, we are tracking toward a record year for both gross fundraising and deployment. A record amount of $85 billion in shadow AUM, or AUM not yet paying fees, ideally positions us to capitalize on a return to a more normalized state of deployment and realizations in many sectors. When you combine this AUM not yet paying fees, with our FRE-rich earnings mix and future European waterfall realization potential, we believe we have strong visibility for future earnings for our stockholders. Looking at this quarter's earnings, starting with revenues. Our management fees totaled over $757 million in the quarter, an increase of 18% compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by positive net deployment of our AUM not net paying fees.\nJarrod Phillips: Fee-related performance revenues totaled $44 million, primarily from the third quarter crystallization of our open-ended core alternative credit fund, along with a smaller contribution from APMF, which typically will be earned quota. This represents our first significant full-year realization from our open-ended core alternative credit funds, and we anticipate this will now be an annual crystallization occurring in the third quarter of each year. We continue to expect the majority of our credit group FRPR to be realized in the fourth quarter as most of our separately managed accounts crystallize annually at the end of the fiscal year. At this point, we are forecasting a range of $160 million to $170 million in fee-related performance revenues and $60 million to $70 million in net FRPR for our credit group in the fourth quarter. The amount remains subject to change as these performance fees are based on total return through December 31 and could be impacted by underlying changes in the value of these loans from movements in credit spreads and foreign exchange rates.\nJarrod Phillips: Compensation expenses, excluding FRPR compensation, increased 13% for the year-ago period, driven by additional headcount along with higher Part 1 fees and related compensation. Overall, our G&A expenses were essentially flat quarter-over-quarter as the benefit from lower event expenses was offset by higher consulting and professional fees, including about $3.5 million of onetime professions. We expect G&A expenses will move moderately up due to higher expected supplemental distribution fees related to our strong start in Q4, along with higher seasonal travel expenses, costs for our newly expanded New York office lease, and recent headcount growth. Now let me spend a moment on the supplemental distribution fees, which are paid on certain wealth management funds raised. Quarterly supplemental distribution fees totaled $13 million, a decline from the second quarter of $15 million, which reflects a fundraising mix shift from the domestic wire houses to more international wealth management distribution partners. We were able to offset $4 million of supplemental distribution fees through a decrease in compensation expense associated with the Part 1 fees and the FRPR that we have discussed previously. During the quarter, the $9 million of net supplemental distribution fees reduced FRE and lowered our FRE margin by 107 basis points. On a year-to-date basis, net supplemental distribution fees have reduced our FRE by $24 million and our FRE margin by 102 basis points. These supplemental distribution fees are more than triple the expense amount in the same period last year. Although these supplemental distribution fees initially put pressure on our fee-related earnings and FRE margins as we scale in the channel, we believe that the addition of the associated perpetual life assets in the wealth channel, which pay management and incentive fees would be very valuable. Importantly, we expect to gain greater absorption in these onetime fees as we scale the channel. During the third quarter, FRE totaled approximately $339 million, a 24% increase from the previous year, primarily due to higher management fees and FRPR. Our FRE margin at 41.1% remained essentially unchanged from the same quarter a year ago, in part due to the aforementioned supplemental distribution fees. For the fourth quarter, we expect a meaningful sequential increase in our total fee income along with our total FRE, but a sequentially lower overall FRE margin of approximately 40%. This is due in part to the impact of the supplemental distribution fees we discussed lower margins on the expected ramp in credit FRPR in the quarter and higher compensation costs primarily from new hires. For the full year, we do expect to show moderately higher FRE margins in 2024 compared to 2023. With interest rates beginning to decline, we anticipate an acceleration in FRE growth and an expansion in our FRE margin in 2025 driven by a broadening out of deployment across a greater number of our investment strategies and improved operating leverage within our wealth can.\nJarrod Phillips: As we flagged in the second quarter at this point in our fund's life cycle, the third quarter was lighter on European-style waterfall realizations. As a reminder, approximately 85% of our accrued net performance [indiscernible] and since we are not yet in the full harvest period for our funds, 60% to 70% of net realized performance income from our European funds is generally recognized in our fourth quarter, with 30% in Q2 and the remaining 10% split between the first and third quarters. In our third quarter, we generated only $9 million of net realized performance income, driven mainly by real estate and credit funds with European style waterfalls, and an absence of material sales from funds that have an American style waterfall. For the fourth quarter of 2024, we are estimating $90 million to $95 million in net realized performance income from both our European and American style funds. For 2025, we continue to have good visibility on the continued expected ramp in our European style realized net performance income. For 2025, we estimate European style net realized performance income to be between $225 million and $275 million. And with a better macro environment backdrop, we would expect to potentially recognize more of our American style of crude performance income as well. For 2026, we continue to expect another significant year-over-year increase in our European style net realized performance income compared to our 2025 levels.\nJarrod Phillips: Realized income in the third quarter totaled $339 million, a 28% increase from the previous year and after-tax realized income per share of Class A common stock was $0.95, up 14% in the third quarter of 2023. As of September 30, our AUM was $464 billion, up 17% from the year ago period. Our fee paying AUM reached $287 billion at the end of the quarter, up 16% from the previous year. Our AUM not yet paying fees available for future deployment increased to approximately $74 billion at quarter end, representing approximately $722 million in potential annual management fees, not including any Part 1 fees or FRPR. Our incentive eligible AUM increased by 15% compared to the third quarter of 2023, reaching $267 billion. Of this amount, over $88 billion is uninvested, which represents significant potential for performance income. In the third quarter, our net accrued performance income jumped nearly 10% quarter-over-quarter to $968 million, primarily from relatively strong capital appreciation and income compounding above our hurdle rates across our credit, real assets, and private equity funds. Finally, I'd like to highlight our strong Q3 fund performance, which is underscored by broad outperformance within our private credit strategies. Across our credit group, our strategy composites generated quarterly gross returns ranging from 2.5% to 6.5%, with 12-month gross returns ranging from 8% to over 20%. Our credit portfolios continue to see positive fundamental growth in limited credit issues, and we believe we are well positioned for a variety of economic scenarios, particularly as approximately 95% of our corporate credit assets are senior in the capital structure. Notably, ARCC reported quarterly improvements in nonaccruals to levels well below historical averages, improved interest coverage, and double-digit portfolio company EBITDA growth. Furthermore, the weighted average loan-to-value in the loan portfolio stood at 43%, significantly lower than the market average of roughly 50% over the past 10 years. Across our real asset composites, we generated gross returns and infrastructure debt of 2.6% for the quarter and 9% for the last 12 months. Our real estate equity strategies are delivering strong returns relative to comparable market equivalents. We continue to see positive fundamentals and valuations in our real estate portfolios. And in the third quarter, we saw appreciation in each of our real estate fund composites. This includes positive quarterly returns and our two nontraded REITs, which collectively brought in modest net inputs. In general, we believe we saw a bottoming in property values for most asset classes during the spring and are now seeing more downward pressure on cap rates while underlying property cash flows generally continue to rise. Our corporate private equity composite at a gross quarterly return of just under 2%, as one fund was impacted by its public position in the Sabres Value Village. Our most recent corporate private equity fund ACOF VI has generated gross quarterly and 12-month returns of 4.8% and 22.8%, respectively, and has a since inception gross internal rate of return of 24.2%. Our corporate private equity portfolios continued to demonstrate strong fundamentals with double-digit year-over-year organic EBITDA growth. Now I'll turn it back to Mike for closing comments.\nMichael Arougheti: Great. Thanks, Jarrod. I continue to believe that Ares is well positioned to succeed in an improving transaction environment. Our management fee-centric business and asset-light balance sheet are critical elements of our strategy as we seek to capitalize on the growth of our platform and our industry. There are many positive secular drivers influencing our business, including assets moving out of the global banking system to private credit, the significant need for infrastructure investment and clean energy, the growing penetration of alternatives in the wealth channel, and the continued consolidation of GP relationships among institutional investors. We also expect to see improving growth for our real asset strategies as rates begin to normalize. We believe that these growth engines will contribute more fully to our overall growth and associated operating efficiencies in 2025. As always, our talented team collaborating across the globe drives the current and future success of our business, and I'm deeply grateful for their hard work and dedication. I'm also deeply appreciative of our investors' ongoing support for our company. And with that, operator, I think that we can now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America.\nCraig Siegenthaler: We're seeing some very big drawdown fund raises across the industry, and the private credit semi-liquid vehicles continue to lead in the private wealth channel. And just of note, one of your big competitors just closed a sizable drawdown in the institutional channel, and Ares just raised the $34 billion Senior Direct Lending Fund III, which is an industry record. So just given this ramp in industry AUM and dry powder, do you see any challenges to deployments heading into next year, especially with the reopening of the BSL market?\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. Thanks, Greg. A couple of things to highlight. As we said in the prepared remarks, private credit fundraising is actually down sequentially for the last three years. So one of the things that you're actually seeing, and this has been a trend that's been in place for close to a decade, that the dollars getting raised and the dollar is getting deployed are actually becoming more concentrated in the hands of the larger managers. I think that has a lot to do with the ability for the larger managers to get deployed with significant diversification and just the benefits of scale as it relates to origination, investment in portfolio management, risk systems, et cetera. So I don't think it's a read across when you look at the size of the funds getting raised by the market leaders to say that there's too much capital in the market. When you look at the deployment numbers, it would tell you something different, which is the deployment is also concentrated, and we're each finding ways to continue to grow the business nicely in high-quality assets in what has been a fairly benign M&A market. So I think we're in a good place. As we talked about in the prepared remarks, if you look at SDL III on that $34 billion fund, we're already 30% invested at the final close. So that will give you some perspective just in terms of the pacing of the capital raising and the capital deployment. And without getting into all of the details, but we did talk about this again in the Investor Day presentation a couple of months back, the TAM for private credit continues to grow, and it's important that people appreciate that this is not just a sponsor lending business, this is a broad-based private credit business across corporates, real estate, infrastructure, alternative credit, it's global. And there are secular trends in place. You mentioned, obviously, BSL market coming back, but there's a general debanking trend that I think is outpacing whatever competition we're seeing from the traded sub-investment-grade market. So a long-winded way of saying we're obviously paying attention to the competitive dynamic. But as we see it, we actually still think that the private credit market is undercapitalized relative to the opportunity.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Mike, thanks for the point there. I think one thing driving that has been the lack of fundraising in the public BDC market the last couple of years versus '20 and '21. Do you think that changes next year with overall rerisking activity picking up? And if it does, do you think the consolidation trend has the potential to actually head in the other direction?\nMichael Arougheti: I don't actually, again, because I think that the consolidation trend is rooted in a view that we've held for a long time that scale drives performance. When you look at the public BDC market, you are already beginning to see meaningful dispersion in performance across the manager landscape. And I think that's an important thing to keep an eye on as we get into this broader conversation about quality and size. So I think the public BDC market is an important part of the ecosystem, but obviously less important. The other thing to keep in mind, the published numbers that most people refer to around the size of the private credit market do not include public BDCs. So the data, for example, it's published is excluding the publicly traded BDC market.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlexander Blostein: First question around just asset-backed finance opportunity and kind of private credit 2.0 in a way that we've talked about for the last couple of quarters. Lots of focus on origination being really kind of the driver of differentiated opportunities in the space. So curious if you can sort of update us on your origination capabilities of their additional partnerships you think you need to do there in order to kind of further accelerate that part of the market?\nMichael Arougheti: I think the simple answer, Alex, is no. Obviously, partnership is an important tenet of our culture. And as we continue to grow that business, we'll look to either own teams in-house or have JV partnerships. So for example, we mentioned in the script, our recently signed joint venture with CAL Automotive, which is a multi-decade track record prime auto lessor, and we set up a joint venture with them to effectively purchase and investment up to $1.5 billion in prime new vehicle leases that they originate. So we've said this before, there are some people that are talking about origination as owning platforms, that's great. There are certain folks like us that are talking about owning teams that are employees of Ares where we see long-term sustainable origination opportunities. And then there are things in between where you may see something that's more tactical, and you'll do it through some kind of a joint venture partnership. Just to reiterate, we have over 70 investment professionals that are focusing on this market. We cover 30 different asset classes where we believe there is investable market, and we have domain expertise, certain markets come in and out of favor. So it's important that the origination and the asset class capability is broad and diversified, but we have a lot of scale opportunity in that market, and the team, as it's currently situated, can continue to grow at the pace that's been growing.\nAlexander Blostein: Got it. All right. That makes sense. Jarrod, one for you on FRE margins. So getting a little bit of a reset this year. So I appreciate the color there. I guess, not surprisingly, like kind of given the dynamics in the retail distribution channel and just focus on top-line growth. So we've talked about that in the past. But I guess if you look out into 2025 and maybe we could exclude the noise from FRPR entirely from kind of this discussion. But is it likely for Ares to get back to, call it, a more normal 100 basis points-or-so of FRE margin expansion into 2025, again, kind of excluding FRPR noise?\nJarrod Phillips: Sure. Great to hear from you this morning. I'd go back to what we said at the Investor Day. And our primary focus is where are we investing in and how can we continue to grow? And sometimes that takes away from what our actual margin capability is because we could certainly increase the margin, but that would be at the cost of future investments. And that's not what we want to be doing. However, we did say that as we deploy that margin will expand. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we do expect year-over-year that you'll see a slight amount of margin expansion, and that will continue into 2025 and pace of deployment certainly helps with that. And I think it will still be within that range of the 0 to 150 basis points that we laid out at Investor Day. And that's not including anything from GCP as we don't have an exact close date or anything of that nature. So that's just the standard what we have right now.\nMichael Arougheti: Alex, just doing the simple math, I think mentioning the distribution fees, if you excluded those, which are kind of obviously positive variance to the base case, given the growth in wealth, we would have scaled margin over 100 basis points if you back those out.\nAlexander Blostein: No, I totally get it. It's a timing thing, and it's a worthwhile investment. Makes sense.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nUnknown Analyst: This is [ Brendan O'Brien ] filling in for Steven. I guess to start, there's been a lot of focus around the spread between private credit and the broadly syndicated market and how much that has narrowed over the past year. While you do partake some of the larger club deals out there, as you alluded to in the prepared remarks, you have a much bigger focus on the middle market relative to some of your competitors. So I just wanted to get a sense as to whether you see any differences in spread compression in the middle market relative to larger deal activity. And at a higher level, do you view the spread compression as being a function of increased competition? Or is simply a lack of new supply or some combination of both?\nMichael Arougheti: I would add 1/3, which is a really healthy economic backdrop and lower-than-expected defaults and losses in the market. So obviously, credit spreads on an absolute basis, they're going to be a reflection of first and foremost of people's perception of risk in the asset class. And when you look at where the market stands, both traded and private, I think the default rate is significantly below historical averages. And when you look at some of the statistics that we're referencing in our portfolio around continued double-digit EBITDA growth, low loans to value, improving interest coverage that there's a general sentiment that despite the anxieties that people tried to put into the market two years ago, the performance has actually improved. And so there's a general narrowing of credit spread. So I think it's important that people anchor on that as well and not just think about it in terms of supply/demand. Kipp did a really nice job, I thought, on the ARCC call talking about credit spread. And there is a durable credit spread in our opinion, between private credit and the traded markets. We've been doing this now for 30 years, and that relative value moves around 150 to 400 basis points depending on where you are in the credit cycle and where the liquidity in the market is. And so again, I wouldn't read into it too much at this moment in time. But we do think that it's important that if you're going to pursue the most attractive relative value or the most attractive excess spread in the market, you have to be able to access every point of the market, and that's why we have been very focused in maintaining our leadership position in every part of the middle market, lower, core, and upper because there are going to be moments in time where the BSL market is going to be more competitive with private credit unit tranche executions, you need to be able to move around the market in search of and that is a core differentiator for our platform. I do think you'll start to see that spread, if not gap out, at least normalize once we start to see normal M&A transaction values come back into the market.\nUnknown Analyst: That's great color. And for my follow-up, I wanted to touch on Part 1 fees. I know you gave the sensitivity in your filings for ARCC and ASIF. However, you've talked about in the past the impact of increased transaction activity and the offset lag impact on Part 1 fees. And with ASIF scaling very quickly, I just wanted to get a sense as to how we should be thinking about the increased contribution from ASIF going forward and the increased transaction activity relative to the rate headwind on Part 1 fees and whether it's possible that this could actually result in Part 1 fees continuing to grow even as rates come down?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, I do think that we expect Part 1 fees to continue to grow because the growth in absolute dollars will outpace the impact of spread compression. Again, as we've talked about, it's important to think about the components of return in these private credit instruments that are driving a lot of the Part 1 fees, right, you get upfront fees. You have base rates, you have your credit spread. And so typically, rates will be going down in response to a weakening economic environment, which then typically correlates with credit spreads that are widening. And if reduced rates actually catalyze increased transaction activity, you tend to get more upfront fees. So it's not just linear that when rates go down, Part 1 fees go down because there are other components of return that actually come into play. So it's -- again, it's important to understand how that works. When you look at the sensitivity and again, you can look at the ARCC disclosures in their queue, which represents a big chunk of part 1, but 100 basis point decline just linearly in interest rates would probably impact our FRE by $9 million per year. So all else being equal, if you had a 100 basis point decline, we would lose $9 million, but then you'd obviously pick up a significant portion of that based on the dynamic I just talked about. So the rate picture is not really that much of a headwind to Part 1. And as you pointed out, not just ASIF, but the growth in other nontraded vehicles like our private markets fund and our European income fund, I think will outpace whatever headwind we face.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Bill Katz with TD Cowen.\nWilliam Katz: Commentary. So you had guided to sort of mid-80s maybe [indiscernible] a little bit earlier, I might have missed it, mid-80s gross inflow number for the full year, which would suggest another strong fourth quarter in front of us. I was just wondering if you could unpack where you're seeing the strength? And as you think through into next year, I was wondering if you can maybe help us think through the building blocks as we sort of think about comps to this year?\nMichael Arougheti: Jarrod, do you want to take that one?\nJarrod Phillips: Sure thing. So next year, in terms of our buildout and the fund raise, we will continue to have a number of different comingled products as well as the retail products. One of the things that Mike and I have talked a lot about with all of you is that we continue to raise the floor of our fundraising capabilities and a lot of that's come from the build-out of that retail channel that we've talked a little bit about on this call. But we still have had large commingled fundraises that have had successive vintages above the prior vintage. I'd expect to see that continue to occur. And in the market next year, we'll have a number of different funds from strategies like our special opportunity strategy. We'll continue to have our second climate infrastructure fund. We'll have various funds out of our secondaries group. We'll have a few funds out of our retail -- our real estate group as well. I do expect that with the real estate markets continuing to return, we'll see improved flows into things like the REITs. So it's really platform-wide. I think we'll have a total of about 35 funds that will be in the market next year. And it won't be one dominant fund like SPL or ASIC like we had over the last couple of years. but it will be a number of different funds from across the platform, really broadening out the platform and coming from all different\nWilliam Katz: Okay. And just a follow-up. We're another three months into the wealth management opportunity and certainly early days in general and a very large denominator. What are you hearing from your relationships on the distribution side? It does seem like the distribution economics or the price of economics are deteriorating. But is there a concentration opportunity here of just Ares that's emerging as a disproportionate winner, are you actually seeing that in any of the conversations with the distributors on how they're allocating these opportunities for channel access?\nMichael Arougheti: We're not. If you look at the last, call it, three to five years, I think there was more concentration in the channel, and so we've actually seen a broadening out of market share. We've obviously picked up considerable share, but it's actually been diversifying generally in the hands of the top players. The TAM here, as everyone has talked about, is quite significant. And I think that there are certain folks, ourselves being one of them, that are emerging as leaders just based on the investment that we've made in our distribution and servicing capability, the breadth of the product suite, the strength of the brand, the track record of performance. So you will continue to see significant growth channel-wide and similar to what I talked about in the institutional private credit market, I think you'll continue to see concentration of market share in the hands of the platforms that were early and made the necessary investments to win.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: Sort of a follow-up on that last question and totally appreciate it might be a hard question to answer with precision. But are these increasing distribution costs something that's happening sort of uniformly across the different platforms or should we anticipate this headwind would sort of cascade across the different platforms and continue to put upward pressure beyond the impact that you laid out here today?\nMichael Arougheti: So the distribution cost is fairly uniform across the industry. And so it's not as though Ares is having a different experience than our peer set. And again, I want to make sure that we don't really refer to this as a headwind because it's actually a pretty significant tailwind, and it's where you begin to see economies of scale. So if we pay an upfront distribution fee to raise permanent or semipermanent capital and those funds turn on management fee the day that the dollar is raised, there's a pretty quick absorption of that upfront fee. And so as Jarrod said on the prepared remarks, while we're experiencing it now as a \"headwind\" to our FRE margin, as we continue to scale you'll see faster and faster absorption of that as the management fees turn on for a broader number of products. So we'll obviously have to keep highlighting this and talking about it so that people can kind of get their heads around it as we ramp. But it is uniform. We're experiencing what our peers are experiencing. And I don't expect that it will -- that we're going to see a meaningful change.\nBrennan Hawken: Yes. Sorry, I was not clear. I didn't mean whether or not this is very specific and not other alternative firms. What I meant is are you seeing it at only some distribution partners and then it could spread the other distribution partners, meaning that we could continue to see this ramping as you continue to...\nMichael Arougheti: Got it. No, I don't think. I think the landscape is fairly well set as we talked about a little bit on the prepared remarks, there is a different market structure, for example, in the domestic wire houses versus the international channel and some of that mitigates. Obviously, what we have been doing is making sure that as we think about our compensation framework around these funds that were effectively recapturing the distribution expense before we're sharing the upside with the team. So there's a lot that we do to make sure that we're focused on that absorption, but the international market functions differently. But in the U.S. market, again, it's pretty broad based, and I wouldn't expect it to bleed into other segments of the market.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay. I appreciate that, Mike. And then when we think about the, Jarrod, $90 million to $95 million waterfall, you laid out. How does that compare to your prior expectations of the 60 to 70 just from the Europeans? I know -- is the increase just purely from adding the American waterfall or did the European outlook improve as well?\nJarrod Phillips: No, it's a [indiscernible]. It's pretty consistent European waterfall along with the add of incentive fees that we received at the end of the year that don't qualify as FRPR and then a little bit of American waterfall. So it's all those things going into the fourth quarter.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: Just a question on the private wealth channel. Hoping you could maybe elaborate a bit on the new core infra strategy, how you see the opportunity set with that product in the channel? And maybe you could elaborate a bit on the flow strength in October. I think you mentioned that's the largest month of inflows to date in the channel. Maybe just unpack the strength there, what you're seeing and how you see the cadence of expanding your presence on platforms into '25?\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. So yes, October was our -- was a very, very strong month. We did $1.2 billion in equity in the month. It was across multiple products led by ASIF, but also really strong performance in ESIF, the new core infrastructure fund, and continued growth in private markets. So it was broad-based. The core infrastructure fund, we're happy because it was launched quickly and seeded quickly with $400 million and is now in the market and building. And we have a pretty unique tax advantage structure there where we actually, just through the structure of that fund and the nature of the assets that we intend to invest in, believe that we could produce a 500 to 700 basis point premium to what you would typically get just in a nontax advantage core infrastructure. So it's a nice core infrastructure exposure, but it has some really unique tax attributes that we think will be quite attractive to the platform. Look, we continue to build the product suite as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we're working on a nontraded product around our sports media and entertainment practice. We continue to systematically roll out products where we can meet the needs of our platform partners. And as the product set develops, we're obviously increasing and expanding our distribution relationships. So as we talked about, we're now on 60 distribution platforms, which is up 50% year-over-year, and that will, I would expect, continue to grow and diversify. So it's build a product set, expand your distribution and that's been the playbook, but it's been pretty rhythmic and then sequential in the way that we're doing it.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. And then just a follow-up question on real estate. I think you've mentioned that you expect to see transactional activity improve across the real estate marketplace as well as potentially flows improve on the nontraded REIT space. Maybe you could just unpack that a bit? Maybe just elaborate where you expect you to see the improvement here? What do you see driving that? And maybe speak to some of the areas you're leaning into on the deployment side?\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. I think we have Bill and Julian. I don't know if they want to give some of their perspectives.\nUnknown Executive: Sure. Happy to. We are seeing quarterly, over the year, a real pickup in activity, both in debt and equity. Our highest conviction themes have been for quite some time, industrial, both in the U.S. and in Europe and multifamily in those geographies. And we are seeing pickups in there, too. done some large hotel transactions in the U.K. and lending is pretty broad-based across product types. So other than offices, and we're nibbling at some offices in London, it remains to be industrial, residential, student, single-family. Did our first retail deal in the U.S. in many, many years, very attractive shopping center in your Cape Cod. So that's a flavor of what we're seeing.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell: Maybe I'll put two together for my two questions, both in the retail segment. One, on the distribution channel. I think at Investor Day, you were still at something like just 5%-or-so of your addressable market. So as you look to expand that and potentially can expand in channels that don't have as heavy of the supplemental distribution fees, how do you think about the growth into that addressable market just from getting more advisers selling your product? That's one. And then dovetailing with that is the product launch pipeline. I think you also said at Investor Day looking at about 8 to 10 semi-liquid perpetual products by '28. You're already at 7% now. And I would -- seemingly, you've got more ideas with the sports products and then potentially maybe comment on products you could even do with GCP. Just should we be seeing more than 10 products maybe by '28?\nMichael Arougheti: It is possible. And I'm glad you mentioned GCP. I think, given their capability and our ability to now offer more global product around industrial real estate and digital infrastructure, I think that our product capability is clearly going to grow and diversify. So that acquisition may get us to a point where we can be outside that range of 8 to 10. At our Investor Day, we were at 6, we're now at 7. And as you said, we've got a couple in the pipeline. So we're kind of already there. That said, with the current product and the products in the pipeline, it does project a portfolio of products that gives the investor access to pretty much everything that we do here. So we may not be as active in bringing new product. I can't quite comment on that until we get to the point where we've kind of got these products in the market, and we know what that looks like. In terms of the first part. Again, I don't think that our view has changed. We are growing in line with the commentary that we made at the Investor Day, if not slightly ahead. And it's important that you're covering every part of the market, domestic and international, in order to achieve those objectives. So obviously, the largest part of the market is in the wirehouse platforms, but the fastest-growing part of the market is in the RIAs. And so you have to be thinking about it in terms of where do you see rapid growth, but then where do you also see scale? And I think you have to go after both of them.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.\nKenneth Worthington: Are distribution costs something you consider when focusing your resources in wealth management or is it something that you might expect you would reasonably consider in the future? And do you get the sense that distribution is getting more sophisticated when allocating their access to their platforms, are we still in this all-you-can-eat buffet environment?\nMichael Arougheti: I think it is getting more sophisticated. And as I mentioned, I think it's getting more concentrated in the handful of a number of brands that can support the continuing education of the large platforms. And so I don't think it is all-you-can-eat. I think it's been very intentional in building out the outcomes around durable yield and diversified equity and tax. And so there's an intentionality as to the products that we're creating. That's a push and a pull in collaboration with the platforms. And I think you're seeing a reduced number of managers that are getting the access points. And again, I would expect that to continue. In terms of the distribution, the cost of distribution, again, I want to highlight the cost of distribution on a per dollar basis for us is actually going down in the channel as we scale. So there is meaningful economies of scale in our distribution platform just based on the number of people we have and what the capability and capacity is. And so while we're all here focusing on absolute dollars, if you think about cost per dollar raise, we're actually seeing meaningful decreases in the cost per dollar raised in terms of our own lift experience relative to what it was a year ago.\nKenneth Worthington: In secondaries, returns negative this quarter, negative over the last 12 months. We know performance lags, but it still seems like that area is underperforming. Demand still is quite good for Ares' secondary products. So maybe what's going on here from a return perspective?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. I don't -- it does lag. So you first have to think about, at least in the private equity, there is a lag effect. So when we're talking about Q3 returns in secondaries. You are really talking about Q2 numbers. And then maybe without getting into all of the nuances of how secondary returns roll through funds, oftentimes, if you're buying discounted portfolios, you pull return forward and then give return back over the life of the fund. So it's always more relevant to look at inception-to-date return as opposed to quarter-over-quarter return when you're looking at secondaries? And so when you look at the inception to date returns broadly speaking, across that family of funds, they're doing what they're supposed to do.\nOperator: We'll take our last question from Mike Brown with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMichael Brown: Great. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I guess maybe another follow-up on the wealth market. We've seen some gainable fund filings from some peers. You guys have a large successful interval fund with a partner and that just crossed the $6 billion AUM level. Just wanted to hear what's your outlook here for this fund structure? Can you iterate on that product structure and then even expand the distribution there to a wider wealth spectrum?\nMichael Arougheti: I think the simple answer at least with regard to which is our diversified credit fund. That is -- it is already scaled with a 5-year track record and it offers diversified credit exposure, both liquid and illiquid. And so I do think that we have a running head start there, and we can continue to expand distribution. With regard to a lot of the announced partnerships, and we're beginning to obviously see some detail on what the product set is, and we talked about this on the last call, you have to really think about those products from the angle of, will it enhance distribution, number one? And number two, will it enhance the client experience in terms of the product that they can invest in and/or the returns that they can get? And so I think if we were to look at partnerships like the ones that others have announced, we would have to be convinced that we're getting access to points of distribution that are accretive and additive to what we currently have and that it will meaningfully change the investment performance or the customer experience relative to what they have now. And at least today, and we've had discussions with many potential partners, given our product set and our capability in liquid and illiquid credit, right, we have a very large liquid credit business, where we're able to offer access to the broadly syndicated loan market, the high-yield market, the rated ABS market, so until we convince ourselves that there is a portion of the fixed income market that we can't deliver to the client ourselves or that the client absolutely wants to access that part of the market package with private credit, we're probably going to be a little bit slower to move there. But obviously, it's noteworthy, but I appreciate you bringing up our fund because while there's a lot of talk about how novel this product is, we've been running this product at scale for quite some time and obviously have a pretty significant track record of performance there.\nMichael Brown: Yes, great. Thank you for all those thoughts, Mike. Just a quick follow-up on FRPR. If I heard the guide correctly, I think it was for 160 to 170 for 4Q, so I guess the midpoint there would be about in line with where it was in the fourth quarter last year. And I guess, the comp ratio would imply a bit of a high level for 4Q. I know it was quite elevated in the third quarter, so can you just maybe unpack the right way to think about the comp ratio for FRPR as we think about, call it, '25 or into '26?\nJarrod Phillips: Sure. This quarter here, the alternative credit product open-ended that we had, that has a little bit different comp ratio at 70-30. So that's why you saw that this quarter. But I'd remind you that, that fund also has a charitable tie-in. So 5% of that overall amount is donated to various charities. So it's pretty positive influence on what we're doing and it's pretty innovative for that team to do that as well because part of it's coming out of their allocation. Looking forward at Q4, one of the reasons that, that comp ratio is a little bit different is that you have European funds that are in there as well. And the European funds have a different tax structure in terms of how those are taxed, so there's different employer taxes that are born as a result. So that's what throws off your comp ratios a little bit and we typically guide that it's going to be somewhere in the mid-30s.\nOperator: And it appears that we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the program back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.\nMichael Arougheti: No, we have none. We appreciate everybody spending so much time with us today and all the great questions and continued support, and we look forward to speaking to you by next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our conference call for today.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jarrod Phillips",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, we continued to deliver strong results with high-teens year-over-year growth in AUM and management fees and mid-20s growth in FRE and Real Asset income. With $64 billion already raised this year and more than $74 billion in gross deployment, we are tracking toward a record year for both gross fundraising and deployment. A record amount of $85 billion in shadow AUM, or AUM not yet paying fees, ideally positions us to capitalize on a return to a more normalized state of deployment and realizations in many sectors. When you combine this AUM not yet paying fees, with our FRE-rich earnings mix and future European waterfall realization potential, we believe we have strong visibility for future earnings for our stockholders. Looking at this quarter's earnings, starting with revenues. Our management fees totaled over $757 million in the quarter, an increase of 18% compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by positive net deployment of our AUM not net paying fees. Fee-related performance revenues totaled $44 million, primarily from the third quarter crystallization of our open-ended core alternative credit fund, along with a smaller contribution from APMF, which typically will be earned quota. This represents our first significant full-year realization from our open-ended core alternative credit funds, and we anticipate this will now be an annual crystallization occurring in the third quarter of each year. We continue to expect the majority of our credit group FRPR to be realized in the fourth quarter as most of our separately managed accounts crystallize annually at the end of the fiscal year. At this point, we are forecasting a range of $160 million to $170 million in fee-related performance revenues and $60 million to $70 million in net FRPR for our credit group in the fourth quarter. The amount remains subject to change as these performance fees are based on total return through December 31 and could be impacted by underlying changes in the value of these loans from movements in credit spreads and foreign exchange rates. Compensation expenses, excluding FRPR compensation, increased 13% for the year-ago period, driven by additional headcount along with higher Part 1 fees and related compensation. Overall, our G&A expenses were essentially flat quarter-over-quarter as the benefit from lower event expenses was offset by higher consulting and professional fees, including about $3.5 million of onetime professions. We expect G&A expenses will move moderately up due to higher expected supplemental distribution fees related to our strong start in Q4, along with higher seasonal travel expenses, costs for our newly expanded New York office lease, and recent headcount growth. Now let me spend a moment on the supplemental distribution fees, which are paid on certain wealth management funds raised. Quarterly supplemental distribution fees totaled $13 million, a decline from the second quarter of $15 million, which reflects a fundraising mix shift from the domestic wire houses to more international wealth management distribution partners. We were able to offset $4 million of supplemental distribution fees through a decrease in compensation expense associated with the Part 1 fees and the FRPR that we have discussed previously. During the quarter, the $9 million of net supplemental distribution fees reduced FRE and lowered our FRE margin by 107 basis points. On a year-to-date basis, net supplemental distribution fees have reduced our FRE by $24 million and our FRE margin by 102 basis points. These supplemental distribution fees are more than triple the expense amount in the same period last year. Although these supplemental distribution fees initially put pressure on our fee-related earnings and FRE margins as we scale in the channel, we believe that the addition of the associated perpetual life assets in the wealth channel, which pay management and incentive fees would be very valuable. Importantly, we expect to gain greater absorption in these onetime fees as we scale the channel. During the third quarter, FRE totaled approximately $339 million, a 24% increase from the previous year, primarily due to higher management fees and FRPR. Our FRE margin at 41.1% remained essentially unchanged from the same quarter a year ago, in part due to the aforementioned supplemental distribution fees. For the fourth quarter, we expect a meaningful sequential increase in our total fee income along with our total FRE, but a sequentially lower overall FRE margin of approximately 40%. This is due in part to the impact of the supplemental distribution fees we discussed lower margins on the expected ramp in credit FRPR in the quarter and higher compensation costs primarily from new hires. For the full year, we do expect to show moderately higher FRE margins in 2024 compared to 2023. With interest rates beginning to decline, we anticipate an acceleration in FRE growth and an expansion in our FRE margin in 2025 driven by a broadening out of deployment across a greater number of our investment strategies and improved operating leverage within our wealth can. As we flagged in the second quarter at this point in our fund's life cycle, the third quarter was lighter on European-style waterfall realizations. As a reminder, approximately 85% of our accrued net performance [indiscernible] and since we are not yet in the full harvest period for our funds, 60% to 70% of net realized performance income from our European funds is generally recognized in our fourth quarter, with 30% in Q2 and the remaining 10% split between the first and third quarters. In our third quarter, we generated only $9 million of net realized performance income, driven mainly by real estate and credit funds with European style waterfalls, and an absence of material sales from funds that have an American style waterfall. For the fourth quarter of 2024, we are estimating $90 million to $95 million in net realized performance income from both our European and American style funds. For 2025, we continue to have good visibility on the continued expected ramp in our European style realized net performance income. For 2025, we estimate European style net realized performance income to be between $225 million and $275 million. And with a better macro environment backdrop, we would expect to potentially recognize more of our American style of crude performance income as well. For 2026, we continue to expect another significant year-over-year increase in our European style net realized performance income compared to our 2025 levels. Realized income in the third quarter totaled $339 million, a 28% increase from the previous year and after-tax realized income per share of Class A common stock was $0.95, up 14% in the third quarter of 2023. As of September 30, our AUM was $464 billion, up 17% from the year ago period. Our fee paying AUM reached $287 billion at the end of the quarter, up 16% from the previous year. Our AUM not yet paying fees available for future deployment increased to approximately $74 billion at quarter end, representing approximately $722 million in potential annual management fees, not including any Part 1 fees or FRPR. Our incentive eligible AUM increased by 15% compared to the third quarter of 2023, reaching $267 billion. Of this amount, over $88 billion is uninvested, which represents significant potential for performance income. In the third quarter, our net accrued performance income jumped nearly 10% quarter-over-quarter to $968 million, primarily from relatively strong capital appreciation and income compounding above our hurdle rates across our credit, real assets, and private equity funds. Finally, I'd like to highlight our strong Q3 fund performance, which is underscored by broad outperformance within our private credit strategies. Across our credit group, our strategy composites generated quarterly gross returns ranging from 2.5% to 6.5%, with 12-month gross returns ranging from 8% to over 20%. Our credit portfolios continue to see positive fundamental growth in limited credit issues, and we believe we are well positioned for a variety of economic scenarios, particularly as approximately 95% of our corporate credit assets are senior in the capital structure. Notably, ARCC reported quarterly improvements in nonaccruals to levels well below historical averages, improved interest coverage, and double-digit portfolio company EBITDA growth. Furthermore, the weighted average loan-to-value in the loan portfolio stood at 43%, significantly lower than the market average of roughly 50% over the past 10 years. Across our real asset composites, we generated gross returns and infrastructure debt of 2.6% for the quarter and 9% for the last 12 months. Our real estate equity strategies are delivering strong returns relative to comparable market equivalents. We continue to see positive fundamentals and valuations in our real estate portfolios. And in the third quarter, we saw appreciation in each of our real estate fund composites. This includes positive quarterly returns and our two nontraded REITs, which collectively brought in modest net inputs. In general, we believe we saw a bottoming in property values for most asset classes during the spring and are now seeing more downward pressure on cap rates while underlying property cash flows generally continue to rise. Our corporate private equity composite at a gross quarterly return of just under 2%, as one fund was impacted by its public position in the Sabres Value Village. Our most recent corporate private equity fund ACOF VI has generated gross quarterly and 12-month returns of 4.8% and 22.8%, respectively, and has a since inception gross internal rate of return of 24.2%. Our corporate private equity portfolios continued to demonstrate strong fundamentals with double-digit year-over-year organic EBITDA growth. Now I'll turn it back to Mike for closing comments. Sure. Great to hear from you this morning. I'd go back to what we said at the Investor Day. And our primary focus is where are we investing in and how can we continue to grow? And sometimes that takes away from what our actual margin capability is because we could certainly increase the margin, but that would be at the cost of future investments. And that's not what we want to be doing. However, we did say that as we deploy that margin will expand. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we do expect year-over-year that you'll see a slight amount of margin expansion, and that will continue into 2025 and pace of deployment certainly helps with that. And I think it will still be within that range of the 0 to 150 basis points that we laid out at Investor Day. And that's not including anything from GCP as we don't have an exact close date or anything of that nature. So that's just the standard what we have right now. Sure thing. So next year, in terms of our buildout and the fund raise, we will continue to have a number of different comingled products as well as the retail products. One of the things that Mike and I have talked a lot about with all of you is that we continue to raise the floor of our fundraising capabilities and a lot of that's come from the build-out of that retail channel that we've talked a little bit about on this call. But we still have had large commingled fundraises that have had successive vintages above the prior vintage. I'd expect to see that continue to occur. And in the market next year, we'll have a number of different funds from strategies like our special opportunity strategy. We'll continue to have our second climate infrastructure fund. We'll have various funds out of our secondaries group. We'll have a few funds out of our retail -- our real estate group as well. I do expect that with the real estate markets continuing to return, we'll see improved flows into things like the REITs. So it's really platform-wide. I think we'll have a total of about 35 funds that will be in the market next year. And it won't be one dominant fund like SPL or ASIC like we had over the last couple of years. but it will be a number of different funds from across the platform, really broadening out the platform and coming from all different No, it's a [indiscernible]. It's pretty consistent European waterfall along with the add of incentive fees that we received at the end of the year that don't qualify as FRPR and then a little bit of American waterfall. So it's all those things going into the fourth quarter. Sure. This quarter here, the alternative credit product open-ended that we had, that has a little bit different comp ratio at 70-30. So that's why you saw that this quarter. But I'd remind you that, that fund also has a charitable tie-in. So 5% of that overall amount is donated to various charities. So it's pretty positive influence on what we're doing and it's pretty innovative for that team to do that as well because part of it's coming out of their allocation. Looking forward at Q4, one of the reasons that, that comp ratio is a little bit different is that you have European funds that are in there as well. And the European funds have a different tax structure in terms of how those are taxed, so there's different employer taxes that are born as a result. So that's what throws off your comp ratios a little bit and we typically guide that it's going to be somewhere in the mid-30s."

            "name": "Michael Arougheti",
            "content": "Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everybody. I hope you are all doing well. During the third quarter, the macroeconomic backdrop for our business remains constructive, as we continue to see fundraising momentum, modestly improving transaction activity, and solid fundamental performance in our underlying investment portfolios. Lower short-term rates are starting to have a positive impact, leading to higher valuations for rate-sensitive assets and increasing real estate transaction activity. The more supportive market tone is showing up in the strength of our pipelines across the firm, and we are optimistic that we will see increasing transaction volumes over the coming year as the expected rate-cutting cycle progresses. During the third quarter, we generated strong year-over-year growth across our financial metrics, including 18% growth in management fees, 24% growth in fee-related earnings, and 28% growth in our realized income. This growth was supported by global deployment of nearly $30 billion, which is our second-highest quarter on record. This brings year-to-date deployment to $74.6 billion and should set 2024 up to be a record year. In addition, we raised nearly $21 billion of gross capital during the third quarter. With over $64 billion raised year-to-date, we are also now tracking to have our best year ever for fundraising. We are poised for strong future deployment due to our record level of available capital and an expectation that an improving market will broaden out and strengthen our deployment across even more strategies over the next year. Our fundraising success this year is in part due to the heightened institutional and retail investor demand that we are seeing across our private credit strategies, including global direct lending, alternative credit, real estate debt, and infrastructure debt as well as strong interest in our liquid credit strategies. While reported private credit fundraising in the market has declined for three years straight, we believe that our differentiated experience is a testament to our market-leading position and long-dated performance through multiple cycles. Investors continue to prioritize investments that can generate durable yield and excess return over the traded market equivalents regardless of the absolute level of interest rates. We are also seeing strong interest in a variety of secondary strategies and improving interest in real assets. In the third quarter, we raised $20.9 billion in gross new capital, including more than $13.5 billion across our private credit strategies. Over the past 12 months, we have raised more than $57 billion in our private credit strategies. To touch on a few fundraising highlights in the credit business: In the third quarter, we raised $2.8 billion of equity and debt commitments in a final close for SDL III, our third U.S. senior direct lending fund. We expect SDL III will have approximately $34 billion of investment capacity, including related vehicles and anticipated leverage. This amount is nearly double the size of our second vintage and reflects our leading franchise in U.S. direct lending. We are already well underway investing in this third fund, which currently has $11 billion committed across 195 companies. In the third quarter, we also closed on approximately EUR 2 billion of equity investments in our sixth European Direct Lending Fund, bringing total LP commitments to date to approximately $14.5 billion compared to EUR 11 billion for the prior vintage. We anticipate holding a final close for this fund in the fourth quarter, and we believe that this will be the largest European direct lending fund ever raised in the market. We have called more than EUR 3 billion of capital for the fund and are well on our way to building a well-diversified portfolio. In terms of new fund launches, we recently launched the third vintage of our special opportunities fund and expect the first close beginning later in this fourth quarter. We are also working on a number of new products around our sports, media, and entertainment strategy, including both open- and closed-end products for institutional and retail investors. We are seeing significant demand from investors seeking access to the growing and differentiated value for various sports-related franchises. Our team was an early pioneer in this strategy and has become a trusted partner in a large addressable market, which we estimate is more than $750 billion, as professional sports leagues around the globe continue to open up to institutional capital. Fundraising for the third quarter totaled $2.9 billion, including a final close for our fourth U.S. Real Estate Opportunity Fund, which brought the fund and related vehicles to $3.3 billion, a 50% increase over the previous vintage. Our ability to meaningfully scale this latest vintage in a challenging real estate fundraising environment reflects our leading real estate franchise and the relative performance that we have delivered for investors. During the quarter, we completed the first close for our fourth European value-add real estate fund totaling $1 billion, and we are on pace to exceed the previous vintage, which raised EUR 1.5 billion. And finally, in real estate, with less aggressive competition from the banks and increasingly attractive risk-adjusted opportunities in debt, we continue to see strong demand across our real estate debt strategies as evidenced by the $1.2 billion that we raised in the quarter, including over $850 million in European real estate debt. We are also seeing strong momentum across our secondaries group, as we scale existing strategies and launch new fund series. For example, we recently launched a secondaries product focused on global structured solutions, which seeks to provide financing directly to the general partners of private funds. The fund and related vehicles will soon hold its first close with approximately $700 million in equity commitments, which is already 70% of the fund's initial $1 billion target. We are also actively scaling the third vintage of our infrastructure secondaries fund, and we expect to raise nearly $400 million shortly, which would bring the fund and related vehicles to approximately $1.4 billion in equity commitments or more than 40% larger than the previous vintage. Our new credit secondaries business is also seeing significant momentum, and the team recently completed Ares' largest credit secondaries transaction to date, a $500 million highly diversified portfolio of credit secondaries fund stakes. The secondaries market is a promising area for Ares when you match the growing need for liquidity with our more than 1,000 sponsor and 2,600 institutional investor relationships around the globe. As many of you know, we continue to be a leader in the wealth channel with accelerating momentum and an expanding product suite. Our solutions offer individual investors core private markets exposure delivering durable income, diversified equity, and tax-advantaged real assets to the wealth channel globally. During the third quarter, we raised over $2.5 billion of equity commitments and nearly $4 billion in total AUM, including leveraging our semi-liquid well products. Through the third quarter, our year-to-date equity flows into wealth management products totaled over $7 billion, which is more than 3x the fundraising pace over the same period last year. Including leverage, we have raised over $11 billion in wealth management AUM through September 30, and momentum has continued into the fourth quarter. We recently launched our seventh wealth management product, a tax-efficient core infrastructure fund, which successfully raised an initial $400 million in equity commitments in September and October. And lastly, October was our largest fundraising month to date with approximately $1.2 billion in equity flows across our semi-liquid wealth products. We continue to make meaningful progress expanding our distribution partnerships. We are now on 60 platforms, up 50% in the past year, and we continue to see our products gain traction across the U.S. wirehouses, private banks, RIAs, and other distribution platforms globally. We are pleased with the international expansion of the wealth distribution as 37% of year-to-date inflows are from outside the U.S. And in total, we have over $32 billion of AUM across our semi-liquid wealth management products, which is a 57% increase from a year ago. When combining AUM from our publicly traded vehicles and high-net-worth investors in our campaign funds, our total AUM from the retail channel exceeds $88 billion. For the full year, we now expect to end 2024 with total gross capital raised in the mid $80 billion range, well above our 2021 record of $77 billion. Campaign funds or institutional closed-end funds have accounted for approximately 1/3 of fundraising year-to-date, while SMAs, wealth management, public funds, and Aspida accounted for over 50%. We expect our fundraising activities for the remainder of the year and into 2025 to consist of more than 35 active funds, including 15 different campaign funds along with continued inflows into our perpetual funds and SMAs, CLOs, and through Aspida, our growing insurance affiliate. Turning to our investing activities. New issue activity has moderately improved from earlier this year. This has driven a higher gross to net deployment ratio for our private credit strategies, which totaled 42% for the third quarter, an improvement over last quarter's 38% and up from 28% in the first quarter. In U.S. and European direct lending, we invested nearly $16 billion of gross commitments in the quarter across more than 100 companies with net deployment totaling nearly $7 billion. Given the breadth of our origination capabilities, we invest across the spectrum of middle-market companies, including an increased focus on core and lower middle market opportunities due to the superior relative value currently available in those market segments. We also leveraged our incumbency to extend and expand our relationships with many of our strongest borrowers. During the third quarter, approximately 60% of our U.S. direct lending deployment was with existing borrowers, and we roughly doubled our dollar commitments to these portfolio companies. We believe this illustrates the power of our incumbency and our ability to grow alongside our best-performing portfolio companies. By focusing on the lower and core middle markets, we can generate higher risk-adjusted returns with broader coverage and can establish relationships with companies earlier in their growth phases. With an alternative credit, we deployed nearly $3.8 billion in the third quarter, an increase of more than 35% compared to the same quarter last year. With over $40 billion in AUM and a team of 75 investment professionals focusing on both the liquid and illiquid sectors, we believe that we are the largest manager in the higher returning illiquid asset-based credit segment with approximately $22 billion of nonrated AUM. While our team has deep experience with over 30 asset classes in the U.S. and Europe, we focus on investing in relative value, which enables us to hone in on certain asset buses in favor and where scaled capital is required. Most recently, our team has been active across fund finance, residential assets, auto leases, digital infrastructure, and asset management. A couple of great examples include our $1.5 billion joint venture with CAL Automotive for prime auto leases and our role in leading a GBP 755 million preferred equity commitment for Wembley Park, which is a mixed-use neighborhood in London. In addition, our alternative credit team continues to partner directly with banks on a bilateral basis to provide capital relief solutions, including the recent financing agreement that we announced with Investec Bank. It's important to note, though, that we are continuing to scale our $19 billion of liquid investment-grade rated AUM through partnerships with third-party insurance companies and Aspida. We are seeing significant growth in our liquid investment-grade asset-backed segment, which has increased at a 36% CAGR over the past 5 years. In addition, Aspida continues to generate strong organic growth with more than $2 billion in fixed annuity originations and reinsurance flows in the third quarter, and we expect continuing strong flows in the fourth quarter. Within the real asset markets, we are at a meaningful inflection point with rising transaction activity, strong fundamental performance, and promising supply-demand dynamics on the horizon. Across our real estate strategies, we invested more than $2 billion in the third quarter, which was up meaningfully versus the same period a year ago, with a continued emphasis on our highest conviction sectors, including industrial, multifamily, student housing, and single-family rental. Within our Infrastructure segment, we continue to focus on renewable energy and related digital infrastructure investments. And before I provide an update on our recent transaction announcements, I want to take a minute to highlight the long-term growth opportunities that we see in the global industrial real estate, digital infrastructure, and clean energy sectors. Over the past decade, we have been expanding our investment capabilities and capital base in the industrial and renewable energy markets to take advantage of rising demand in e-commerce, the reorganization of global supply chains, infrastructure for AI, the demand for clean energy, and manufacturing reshoring, which is reversing more than four decades of globalizing trade. For instance, estimates suggest that the reshoring of manufacturing will require over 1 billion square feet of logistics support in the next decade. And by 2030, the U.S. will need up to 250 terawatt hours of new energy production to support AI and the expanded manufacturing base. As an example, Ares made a strategic investment in X-Energy, which is developing and building fourth generation of small modular reactors or SMRs. Recently, X-Energy announced that several strategic partners led by Amazon, invested approximately $500 million in a new financing round for the company. Both Amazon and X-Energy, along with existing investors such as Dow and Ares, are seeking to advance the largest deployment to date of safe, clean, and reliable SMR nuclear power aimed at the growing digital and manufacturing economies in the U.S. Now with that perspective, I'd like to reemphasize the strategic importance of our two recently announced acquisitions and real assets, which we believe will not only diversify our business mix but also enhance our growth profile. The GCP International transaction enables us to expand into three critical areas of importance for our firm. First, it expands our real assets presence in the strategically important APAC region, including in Japan and Vietnam within many of our highest conviction sectors like industrial, digital infrastructure, and clean energy. Following our SSG acquisition in 2020 and Crescent Point last year, we have been strategically evaluating inorganic growth opportunities in the region, and GCP International scale, asset positioning, track record, and team represented far and away the most compelling opportunity of the nearly 40 managers that we considered. Second, the transaction expands our vertically integrated industrial real estate capabilities into Japan, Europe, Vietnam, and Brazil. As one of the largest vertically integrated industrial players in the U.S., we believe that expanding our vertical capabilities globally will enhance our value proposition to our LPs and other market participants while enabling us to create new revenue streams as these businesses scale. Third, we are gaining a global presence in a rapidly growing data center development and asset management business with a $7 billion near-term development pipeline, which complements our existing climate infrastructure capabilities. And while I focus on just these three opportunities, there are many more compelling growth and synergy opportunities that GCP International presents, and we believe that we are buying at an opportune time in the real estate cycle with a manager that provides significant growth potential. You may have also seen that we signed an agreement to purchase Walton Street Mexico, an industrial-focused real estate manager with $2.1 billion in AUM as of June 30. This transaction enables us to capitalize on the nearshoring trends that we are seeing across supply chains, and the Walton Street Mexico team is particularly well-positioned to take advantage of this market opportunity. We believe that there are also intriguing synergies with their institutional client base for other Ares products. In both of these cases, we had long-standing relationships with certain principles of these firms, and we believe that each team will be a great cultural fit. Clearly, the addition of these two firms will provide important scale to our Real Assets group and makes us one of the leading players in private equity real estate across the globe. And I'll now turn the call over to Jarrod to discuss our financial results in more detail. Jarrod? Great. Thanks, Jarrod. I continue to believe that Ares is well positioned to succeed in an improving transaction environment. Our management fee-centric business and asset-light balance sheet are critical elements of our strategy as we seek to capitalize on the growth of our platform and our industry. There are many positive secular drivers influencing our business, including assets moving out of the global banking system to private credit, the significant need for infrastructure investment and clean energy, the growing penetration of alternatives in the wealth channel, and the continued consolidation of GP relationships among institutional investors. We also expect to see improving growth for our real asset strategies as rates begin to normalize. We believe that these growth engines will contribute more fully to our overall growth and associated operating efficiencies in 2025. As always, our talented team collaborating across the globe drives the current and future success of our business, and I'm deeply grateful for their hard work and dedication. I'm also deeply appreciative of our investors' ongoing support for our company. And with that, operator, I think that we can now open up the line for questions. Sure. Thanks, Greg. A couple of things to highlight. As we said in the prepared remarks, private credit fundraising is actually down sequentially for the last three years. So one of the things that you're actually seeing, and this has been a trend that's been in place for close to a decade, that the dollars getting raised and the dollar is getting deployed are actually becoming more concentrated in the hands of the larger managers. I think that has a lot to do with the ability for the larger managers to get deployed with significant diversification and just the benefits of scale as it relates to origination, investment in portfolio management, risk systems, et cetera. So I don't think it's a read across when you look at the size of the funds getting raised by the market leaders to say that there's too much capital in the market. When you look at the deployment numbers, it would tell you something different, which is the deployment is also concentrated, and we're each finding ways to continue to grow the business nicely in high-quality assets in what has been a fairly benign M&A market. So I think we're in a good place. As we talked about in the prepared remarks, if you look at SDL III on that $34 billion fund, we're already 30% invested at the final close. So that will give you some perspective just in terms of the pacing of the capital raising and the capital deployment. And without getting into all of the details, but we did talk about this again in the Investor Day presentation a couple of months back, the TAM for private credit continues to grow, and it's important that people appreciate that this is not just a sponsor lending business, this is a broad-based private credit business across corporates, real estate, infrastructure, alternative credit, it's global. And there are secular trends in place. You mentioned, obviously, BSL market coming back, but there's a general debanking trend that I think is outpacing whatever competition we're seeing from the traded sub-investment-grade market. So a long-winded way of saying we're obviously paying attention to the competitive dynamic. But as we see it, we actually still think that the private credit market is undercapitalized relative to the opportunity. I don't actually, again, because I think that the consolidation trend is rooted in a view that we've held for a long time that scale drives performance. When you look at the public BDC market, you are already beginning to see meaningful dispersion in performance across the manager landscape. And I think that's an important thing to keep an eye on as we get into this broader conversation about quality and size. So I think the public BDC market is an important part of the ecosystem, but obviously less important. The other thing to keep in mind, the published numbers that most people refer to around the size of the private credit market do not include public BDCs. So the data, for example, it's published is excluding the publicly traded BDC market. I think the simple answer, Alex, is no. Obviously, partnership is an important tenet of our culture. And as we continue to grow that business, we'll look to either own teams in-house or have JV partnerships. So for example, we mentioned in the script, our recently signed joint venture with CAL Automotive, which is a multi-decade track record prime auto lessor, and we set up a joint venture with them to effectively purchase and investment up to $1.5 billion in prime new vehicle leases that they originate. So we've said this before, there are some people that are talking about origination as owning platforms, that's great. There are certain folks like us that are talking about owning teams that are employees of Ares where we see long-term sustainable origination opportunities. And then there are things in between where you may see something that's more tactical, and you'll do it through some kind of a joint venture partnership. Just to reiterate, we have over 70 investment professionals that are focusing on this market. We cover 30 different asset classes where we believe there is investable market, and we have domain expertise, certain markets come in and out of favor. So it's important that the origination and the asset class capability is broad and diversified, but we have a lot of scale opportunity in that market, and the team, as it's currently situated, can continue to grow at the pace that's been growing. Alex, just doing the simple math, I think mentioning the distribution fees, if you excluded those, which are kind of obviously positive variance to the base case, given the growth in wealth, we would have scaled margin over 100 basis points if you back those out. I would add 1/3, which is a really healthy economic backdrop and lower-than-expected defaults and losses in the market. So obviously, credit spreads on an absolute basis, they're going to be a reflection of first and foremost of people's perception of risk in the asset class. And when you look at where the market stands, both traded and private, I think the default rate is significantly below historical averages. And when you look at some of the statistics that we're referencing in our portfolio around continued double-digit EBITDA growth, low loans to value, improving interest coverage that there's a general sentiment that despite the anxieties that people tried to put into the market two years ago, the performance has actually improved. And so there's a general narrowing of credit spread. So I think it's important that people anchor on that as well and not just think about it in terms of supply/demand. Kipp did a really nice job, I thought, on the ARCC call talking about credit spread. And there is a durable credit spread in our opinion, between private credit and the traded markets. We've been doing this now for 30 years, and that relative value moves around 150 to 400 basis points depending on where you are in the credit cycle and where the liquidity in the market is. And so again, I wouldn't read into it too much at this moment in time. But we do think that it's important that if you're going to pursue the most attractive relative value or the most attractive excess spread in the market, you have to be able to access every point of the market, and that's why we have been very focused in maintaining our leadership position in every part of the middle market, lower, core, and upper because there are going to be moments in time where the BSL market is going to be more competitive with private credit unit tranche executions, you need to be able to move around the market in search of and that is a core differentiator for our platform. I do think you'll start to see that spread, if not gap out, at least normalize once we start to see normal M&A transaction values come back into the market. Yes, I do think that we expect Part 1 fees to continue to grow because the growth in absolute dollars will outpace the impact of spread compression. Again, as we've talked about, it's important to think about the components of return in these private credit instruments that are driving a lot of the Part 1 fees, right, you get upfront fees. You have base rates, you have your credit spread. And so typically, rates will be going down in response to a weakening economic environment, which then typically correlates with credit spreads that are widening. And if reduced rates actually catalyze increased transaction activity, you tend to get more upfront fees. So it's not just linear that when rates go down, Part 1 fees go down because there are other components of return that actually come into play. So it's -- again, it's important to understand how that works. When you look at the sensitivity and again, you can look at the ARCC disclosures in their queue, which represents a big chunk of part 1, but 100 basis point decline just linearly in interest rates would probably impact our FRE by $9 million per year. So all else being equal, if you had a 100 basis point decline, we would lose $9 million, but then you'd obviously pick up a significant portion of that based on the dynamic I just talked about. So the rate picture is not really that much of a headwind to Part 1. And as you pointed out, not just ASIF, but the growth in other nontraded vehicles like our private markets fund and our European income fund, I think will outpace whatever headwind we face. Jarrod, do you want to take that one? We're not. If you look at the last, call it, three to five years, I think there was more concentration in the channel, and so we've actually seen a broadening out of market share. We've obviously picked up considerable share, but it's actually been diversifying generally in the hands of the top players. The TAM here, as everyone has talked about, is quite significant. And I think that there are certain folks, ourselves being one of them, that are emerging as leaders just based on the investment that we've made in our distribution and servicing capability, the breadth of the product suite, the strength of the brand, the track record of performance. So you will continue to see significant growth channel-wide and similar to what I talked about in the institutional private credit market, I think you'll continue to see concentration of market share in the hands of the platforms that were early and made the necessary investments to win. So the distribution cost is fairly uniform across the industry. And so it's not as though Ares is having a different experience than our peer set. And again, I want to make sure that we don't really refer to this as a headwind because it's actually a pretty significant tailwind, and it's where you begin to see economies of scale. So if we pay an upfront distribution fee to raise permanent or semipermanent capital and those funds turn on management fee the day that the dollar is raised, there's a pretty quick absorption of that upfront fee. And so as Jarrod said on the prepared remarks, while we're experiencing it now as a \"headwind\" to our FRE margin, as we continue to scale you'll see faster and faster absorption of that as the management fees turn on for a broader number of products. So we'll obviously have to keep highlighting this and talking about it so that people can kind of get their heads around it as we ramp. But it is uniform. We're experiencing what our peers are experiencing. And I don't expect that it will -- that we're going to see a meaningful change. Got it. No, I don't think. I think the landscape is fairly well set as we talked about a little bit on the prepared remarks, there is a different market structure, for example, in the domestic wire houses versus the international channel and some of that mitigates. Obviously, what we have been doing is making sure that as we think about our compensation framework around these funds that were effectively recapturing the distribution expense before we're sharing the upside with the team. So there's a lot that we do to make sure that we're focused on that absorption, but the international market functions differently. But in the U.S. market, again, it's pretty broad based, and I wouldn't expect it to bleed into other segments of the market. Sure. So yes, October was our -- was a very, very strong month. We did $1.2 billion in equity in the month. It was across multiple products led by ASIF, but also really strong performance in ESIF, the new core infrastructure fund, and continued growth in private markets. So it was broad-based. The core infrastructure fund, we're happy because it was launched quickly and seeded quickly with $400 million and is now in the market and building. And we have a pretty unique tax advantage structure there where we actually, just through the structure of that fund and the nature of the assets that we intend to invest in, believe that we could produce a 500 to 700 basis point premium to what you would typically get just in a nontax advantage core infrastructure. So it's a nice core infrastructure exposure, but it has some really unique tax attributes that we think will be quite attractive to the platform. Look, we continue to build the product suite as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we're working on a nontraded product around our sports media and entertainment practice. We continue to systematically roll out products where we can meet the needs of our platform partners. And as the product set develops, we're obviously increasing and expanding our distribution relationships. So as we talked about, we're now on 60 distribution platforms, which is up 50% year-over-year, and that will, I would expect, continue to grow and diversify. So it's build a product set, expand your distribution and that's been the playbook, but it's been pretty rhythmic and then sequential in the way that we're doing it. Sure. I think we have Bill and Julian. I don't know if they want to give some of their perspectives. It is possible. And I'm glad you mentioned GCP. I think, given their capability and our ability to now offer more global product around industrial real estate and digital infrastructure, I think that our product capability is clearly going to grow and diversify. So that acquisition may get us to a point where we can be outside that range of 8 to 10. At our Investor Day, we were at 6, we're now at 7. And as you said, we've got a couple in the pipeline. So we're kind of already there. That said, with the current product and the products in the pipeline, it does project a portfolio of products that gives the investor access to pretty much everything that we do here. So we may not be as active in bringing new product. I can't quite comment on that until we get to the point where we've kind of got these products in the market, and we know what that looks like. In terms of the first part. Again, I don't think that our view has changed. We are growing in line with the commentary that we made at the Investor Day, if not slightly ahead. And it's important that you're covering every part of the market, domestic and international, in order to achieve those objectives. So obviously, the largest part of the market is in the wirehouse platforms, but the fastest-growing part of the market is in the RIAs. And so you have to be thinking about it in terms of where do you see rapid growth, but then where do you also see scale? And I think you have to go after both of them. I think it is getting more sophisticated. And as I mentioned, I think it's getting more concentrated in the handful of a number of brands that can support the continuing education of the large platforms. And so I don't think it is all-you-can-eat. I think it's been very intentional in building out the outcomes around durable yield and diversified equity and tax. And so there's an intentionality as to the products that we're creating. That's a push and a pull in collaboration with the platforms. And I think you're seeing a reduced number of managers that are getting the access points. And again, I would expect that to continue. In terms of the distribution, the cost of distribution, again, I want to highlight the cost of distribution on a per dollar basis for us is actually going down in the channel as we scale. So there is meaningful economies of scale in our distribution platform just based on the number of people we have and what the capability and capacity is. And so while we're all here focusing on absolute dollars, if you think about cost per dollar raise, we're actually seeing meaningful decreases in the cost per dollar raised in terms of our own lift experience relative to what it was a year ago. Yes. I don't -- it does lag. So you first have to think about, at least in the private equity, there is a lag effect. So when we're talking about Q3 returns in secondaries. You are really talking about Q2 numbers. And then maybe without getting into all of the nuances of how secondary returns roll through funds, oftentimes, if you're buying discounted portfolios, you pull return forward and then give return back over the life of the fund. So it's always more relevant to look at inception-to-date return as opposed to quarter-over-quarter return when you're looking at secondaries? And so when you look at the inception to date returns broadly speaking, across that family of funds, they're doing what they're supposed to do. I think the simple answer at least with regard to which is our diversified credit fund. That is -- it is already scaled with a 5-year track record and it offers diversified credit exposure, both liquid and illiquid. And so I do think that we have a running head start there, and we can continue to expand distribution. With regard to a lot of the announced partnerships, and we're beginning to obviously see some detail on what the product set is, and we talked about this on the last call, you have to really think about those products from the angle of, will it enhance distribution, number one? And number two, will it enhance the client experience in terms of the product that they can invest in and/or the returns that they can get? And so I think if we were to look at partnerships like the ones that others have announced, we would have to be convinced that we're getting access to points of distribution that are accretive and additive to what we currently have and that it will meaningfully change the investment performance or the customer experience relative to what they have now. And at least today, and we've had discussions with many potential partners, given our product set and our capability in liquid and illiquid credit, right, we have a very large liquid credit business, where we're able to offer access to the broadly syndicated loan market, the high-yield market, the rated ABS market, so until we convince ourselves that there is a portion of the fixed income market that we can't deliver to the client ourselves or that the client absolutely wants to access that part of the market package with private credit, we're probably going to be a little bit slower to move there. But obviously, it's noteworthy, but I appreciate you bringing up our fund because while there's a lot of talk about how novel this product is, we've been running this product at scale for quite some time and obviously have a pretty significant track record of performance there. No, we have none. We appreciate everybody spending so much time with us today and all the great questions and continued support, and we look forward to speaking to you by next quarter. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Ares Management Corporation's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Also today's call is being recorded. And now at this time, I would like to turn things over to Mr. Greg Mason, Co-Head of Public Markets, Investor Relations for Ares Management. Please go ahead, sir.\nGreg Mason: Good morning and thank you for joining us today for our second quarter conference call. Speaking on the call today will be Michael Arougheti, our Chief Executive Officer; and Jarrod Phillips, our Chief Financial Officer. We also have several executives with us today who will be available during the Q&A session. Before we begin, I want to remind you that comments made during this call contain forward-looking statements and are subject to risks and uncertainties including those identified in our risk factors in our SEC filings. Our actual results could differ materially and we undertake no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Please also note that past performance is not a guarantee of future results and nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Ares fund. During this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Please refer to our second quarter earnings presentation available on the Investor Resources section of our website for reconciliations of the measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Note that we plan to file our Form 10-Q later this month. This morning, we announced that we declared our third quarter common dividend of $0.93 per share on the company's Class A and non-voting common stock, representing an increase of 21% over our dividend for the same quarter a year ago. The dividend will be paid on September 30, 2024, to holders of record on September 16. Now I will turn the call over to Michael Arougheti, who will start with some quarterly business and financial highlights.\nMichael Arougheti: Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I hope everybody is doing well. The macroeconomic backdrop for our business improved in the second quarter with a stronger transaction environment, solid and stable credit trends and recovering real estate market. Improving economic picture is driven by a combination of a better outlook for both inflation and interest rates, continued labor market strength and increased confidence in the soft landing. Given the more constructive transaction environment, we were more active across many of our investment strategies. In fact, we invested $26 billion in Q2, our second highest quarter on record and more than 70% higher than the same quarter a year ago. As we highlighted at our Investor Day in May, we're continuing to see significant institutional and retail demand globally for our alternative investment products, particularly within broad credit strategies, but also in opportunistic and value-add real estate, affiliated insurance, infrastructure, and a host of secondary strategies. Q2 was our single best quarter fundraising in our history with $26 billion in gross capital raised, bringing the total year-to-date funds raised to $43 billion. For the second quarter our assets under management grew to a record $447 billion up 18% versus a year ago. Our strong deployment and fundraising activities supported a 22% year-over-year growth in fee-related earnings for the quarter. We also had another strong quarter of fund performance as Jarrod will highlight later. Overall, we are pleased with our momentum, the firm's positioning, and the promising outlook for our business. As we've expected for some time, we\u2019re seeing a gradual improvement in transaction volume this year for a variety of reasons; the nearly $1 trillion in private equity dry powder that's aging, significant demand from LPs for a return of capital, a stable rate backdrop and the improving prospects for interest rate cuts, and an economy that remains on solid footing. For Ares, looking across our seven private credit strategies in our credit and real asset groups activity was very strong in the second quarter with gross deployment up over 58% year-over-year. In Q2, we deployed approximately $20 billion in our private credit strategies with net deployment totaling $7.7 billion, more than double Q1 net deployment of $3.3 billion. Looking forward, our investment pipeline suggests continued solid activity, and we have every indication that the second half of the year will continue to be an active deployment environment. The credit quality across our corporate credit assets remains very strong and recent trends indicate stability. As an example our US direct lending portfolio companies experienced their second straight quarter of improving organic EBITDA growth reaching 11% year-over-year. The portfolio's loan-to-value ratio remains in the low 40% range which is meaningfully below historical average market levels and portfolio company leverage multiples are 0.5 turn lower than the prior year. For instance, on its earnings call, ARCC reported a decline in loans on non-accrual to 1.5% and a decline in underperforming loans. Based on the fundamentals that we are seeing across our US and European corporate credit book, our outlook is for continued solid economic growth in these markets and continued favorable credit performance. That said, we are intensely focused on executing our playbook in more active and therefore, competitive markets by out originating our competition using our deep incumbency advantages, performing rigorous fundamental due diligence, negotiating tight documentation structures and staying highly selective. In our real estate strategies, we are seeing market valuations and transaction activity stabilize. Operating fundamentals such as rents and occupancy rates remain positive for our core focus areas of industrial and multifamily, which represented nearly three-quarters of our asset value. Within these segments, we continue to benefit from the growth in e-commerce, onshoring and positive longer-term supply demand dynamics. Our deliberate strategy of extending the duration of our industrial lease terms is enabling us to effectively navigate the market as near-term peak levels of supply are being digested. We are also seeing positive trends in adjacent areas such as student housing, single-family rental and self-storage. Based upon the improving market trends, our real estate team was significantly more active in the second quarter, with deployment more than doubling the year ago period, and our pipeline for new transactions continues to build. We also see significant investment opportunities in data centers and the digital infrastructure needed to support the enormous demands of AI growth. We are investing in digital infrastructure across our various businesses but particularly within infrastructure, alternative credit and real estate. Collectively, we have committed nearly $5 billion in digital-related infrastructure, including data centers, towers and new fiber broadband installations over the past five years. We are also focused on climate infrastructure opportunities and are actively investing in new clean energy projects, including solar, wind and renewable natural gas. Over the past five years, we've committed approximately $3.2 billion in debt and equity investments in these sectors to meet the growing energy needs across the US. Within our secondaries businesses, we continue to see opportunities for new investments across our range of liquidity solutions including purchasing LP portfolios, working with GPs on continuation funds, and providing structured solutions for both GPs and LPs. Overall, the secondary market opportunity remains robust as managers and investors alike try to manage liquidity demands in what has been a transitioning valuation environment and a slower M&A and IPO market. Now let me provide some color on our record fundraising quarter. Across our broad distribution channels, we continue to benefit from increased investor allocations to alternatives a loyal and expanding client base, and our growing scale. All three of our primary fundraising channels; institutional, wealth and insurance are highly productive, and we are seeing a meaningful acceleration in fundraising across our wealth management channel which has more than tripled so far this year compared to last year. Our broad offering of credit strategies continues to lead the way, as our benefits of scale and track record are differentiating factors. In Q2 we raised nearly $20 billion in funds managed accounts and CLOs within our credit group. As you may have seen from earlier this week, we announced the final closing for our US focused Senior Direct Lending Fund III or SDL III, with $33.6 billion of investment capacity. This is the largest institutional private credit fund in the market and is roughly double the $14.9 billion of total investment capital that we raised in SDL II. SDL III's investment capacity included $15.3 billion in fund equity commitments along with related vehicles, closed leverage and anticipated leverage of up to $8 billion that could be raised over the next 12 months. We raised $6.4 billion of capital in Q2 and another $1.8 billion in July for this fund. We're also well underway investing SDL III, having already committed $9 billion of capital to more than 165 companies to-date. With respect to our other large private credit institutional fund in the market, Ares' VI European Direct Lending Fund, we raised another EUR750 million of equity commitments in the second quarter. This brings total equity commitments to EUR12.2 billion today or over EUR18 billion of total investment capacity including anticipated leverage. We expect to raise another EUR1 billion to EUR1.5 billion in equity commitments in the third quarter with additional commitments in the final close expected in Q4. During the quarter, we also continued to raise various funds within our liquid and illiquid credit strategies across our platform. One example is the launch of our Specialty Healthcare Fund, which focuses on direct loans to life sciences companies. We are currently holding our initial closings for this inaugural fund, and we expect to receive commitments totaling approximately $750 million in the coming weeks. We believe that this is a great start for a new product. In addition, we've priced five new CLOs in the quarter. Year-to-date, we've already priced seven CLOs, raising $3.6 billion, exceeding our full year record of seven CLOs for $3.3 billion in 2022. Overall we have raised over $65 billion in the past 18 months across our direct lending strategies. When combined with our fundraising across our other private credit strategies in alternative credit, APAC credit, real estate debt and infrastructure debt, we've raised approximately $85 billion in private credit AUM over the past 18 months. In our Real Assets Group, we are aiming to hold a final close in the third quarter for our fourth US Opportunistic Real Estate Fund, bringing total commitments to $2.7 billion. Based on this anticipated final close size, we expect the fund will exceed the commitments of its predecessor fund by 59% and we believe that this demonstrates meaningful investor support for the strategy and the investment opportunity. We are also off to a great start with our recently launched fourth European Value-Add Real Estate Fund raising approximately EUR600 million in the second quarter, including related vehicles, with additional capital expected for the first close in the third quarter. We also raised another $1.1 billion in our US Real Estate Debt Strategy, as we continue to see attractive values and compelling market dynamics with less competition in this sector. In addition to significant fundraising in our commingled funds, we're also seeing meaningful demand for managed accounts across the platform. For the second quarter and year-to-date periods, we raised $5.4 billion and over $10 billion, respectively, in new commitments in these managed accounts. As I stated earlier, our wealth management business continues to have significant momentum as we penetrate existing distribution, expand into new channels, market to new geographies and broaden our product set. We are in the early phases of the largest generational wealth transfer in history, and importantly we believe that we are seeing a very divergent trend with how baby boomers and the younger generations invest. Baby boomers manage their investment wealth primarily in stocks and bonds, but younger investors are seeking to expand their investing toolkit, by optimizing their portfolios with increased allocations to private market assets. This trend could have significant positive implications for growing wealth allocations, and we believe that we are beginning to see these trends play out in our current results. During the second quarter we raised more than $2.5 billion in new equity commitments across our six non-traded products, and inclusive of leverage we raised $4.5 billion. For the year-to-date period new equity commitments totaled over $4.5 billion which is over 3.5 times the capital raised in the same period a year ago. Since our last earnings call, we've launched certain non-traded solutions with three additional global distribution partners. Based on these expanded partnerships, we expect flows into our wealth focused products to continue to gain momentum through the second half of the year. Aspida, our minority-owned insurance affiliate is on a strong growth trajectory. This quarter it secured nearly $600 million in additional institutional equity from third party investors. With more equity capital expected to be raised in Q3 Aspida is well capitalized and poised for continued expansion. The annuity market is thriving with sales exceeding a record $400 billion on an annualized run rate in the first half of 2024. Aspida is benefiting from these industry tailwinds, experiencing robust flows from new retail annuity sales, and increased flow reinsurance opportunities. So overall, with $43 billion raised in the first 6 months, we're ahead of where we expected to be in midyear, and we believe that we're in a better position to match or potentially exceed the $74.5 billion that we raised in 2023. Our strong first half puts us in an excellent position with record amounts of available capital to deploy. Looking ahead to the next six months, our fundraising is likely to see contributions from a broader and more diverse set of funds. For the year, we expect to have 35 funds in the market across 17 strategies to take advantage of the expected growth in alternative asset allocations. And I will now turn the call over to Jarrod to discuss our financial results in more detail. Jarrod?\nJarrod Phillips: Thank you, Mike and good morning, everyone. As Mike said, we continued to deliver strong results in the second quarter. The year-over-year growth of 22% in FRE along with mid- to high teens growth in AUM, management fees and realized income. The record $26 billion we raised in the second quarter helped drive a 29% increase in our AUM not yet paying fees, ideally situating us to capitalize on growing activity levels, as the markets return to a more normalized state of deployment and realizations in many sectors. When you combine this AUM not yet paying fees with our FRE-rich earnings mix and future European waterfall realization potential, we believe we offer strong visibility for future earnings to our stockholders. Taking a look at this quarter's earnings, starting with revenues. Our management fees totaled over $726 million in the quarter, an increase of 17% compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by positive net deployment of our AUM not yet paying fees. Fee-related performance revenues totaled $21.6 million in the second quarter primarily from our non-traded private equity secondaries product, APMF, along with select credit products [indiscernible]. The $15.2 million of FRPR from APMF benefited from AUM growth, which recently reached approximately $1.6 billion in total assets and was aided by a sizable portfolio purchased in the quarter. We would expect AUM growth in APMF to provide long-term tailwinds for additional FRPR generation. However, FRPR from APMF will be more episodic and accordingly, more difficult to project spikes in FRPR like the one that occurrence. As a reminder, we anticipate realizing 95% or more of our credit FRPR in the fourth quarter. I do want to point out two expenses running through our G&A in the second quarter. First, our Q2 G&A expenses were impacted by our first ever firm-wide AGM held in May. Typically, we hold multiple investor events resulting in cost spread throughout the year instead of being incurred in a single quarter. As a result of this quarterly spike in annual meeting costs, we expect G&A expenses in the second half of the year will benefit from fewer event expenses. Second as we continue to scale our wealth management distribution, we incur greater supplemental distribution fees. These fees totaled $15.3 million in the second quarter, an increase of $6.2 million compared to Q1. Importantly, these fees will be partially offset as we recoup the majority of these expenses over time by reducing employee compensation paid with respect to Part 1 fees or FRPR for the associated funds. In the quarter, FRE totaled approximately $325 million, 22% from the previous year driven by higher management fees and a margin improvement of 130 basis points to 42.1%. In the second quarter, we generated more than $40 million of net realized performance income, driven mainly by credit funds European style waterfalls. Realized income in the second quarter was $363 million a 16% increase over the previous year. And after-tax realized income per share of Class A common stock was $0.99, up 10% from the second quarter of 2023. As of June 30 our AUM stood at $447 billion up 18% from the year ago period. Our fee paying AUM reached $276 million at the end of the quarter, up 14% from the previous year. Following sustained fundraising momentum, our AUM not yet paying fees available for future deployment increased to approximately $71 billion at quarter end, representing $675 million in potential annual management fees. Our incentive eligible AUM increased by 17% compared to the second quarter of 2023, reaching $259 billion. Of this amount, over $86 billion is uninvested, representing significant performance income potential. In the second quarter, our net accrued performance income declined slightly to $919 million, primarily due to a reversal of carried interest in certain corporate private equity and opportunistic credit funds, due to the change in the stock price of our position in Savers Value Village. This was partially offset by growth in our net accrued performance income and our credit strategies as the performance, driven by interest income, meaningfully exceeded the hurdle rates. Of the $919 million of net accrued performance income at quarter-end, $783 million, just over 85%, was in European style waterfall funds with nearly $460 million from funds that are out of their reinvestment periods. For the second half of 2024, we are estimating an additional $60 million to $70 million of net realized performance income from European style funds with nearly all of that amount recognized in the fourth quarter. For 2025, we estimate our 2025 European style net realized performance income will be in a range of $225 million to $275 million. The slight decrease in our 2025 estimate is primarily related to one fund where we currently anticipate our realization timing could shift from the end of 2025 to 2026. However the total net realized performance income expected over the life of this one fund is largely unchanged. For 2025, it is best to assume that 60% of our annual European style performance income will be realized in the quarter, 30% in the second quarter and about 10% spread across the third and first quarters with [indiscernible]. The current seasonality of our European style waterfall realizations, primarily due to the early stage of our larger eligible credit funds that make tax distributions which we realize as net performance income compared to older smaller European style funds which are realizing the full net performance income payable near the end of their fund life. The seasonality will persist as several of our larger European funds start regularly realizing performance income, towards the end of their fund lives potentially beginning in 2026. Finally, I would like to discuss our recent fund performance, which is highlighted by broad outperformance within our private credit strategies. Across our credit group, our strategy composites all generated double-digit gross returns over the past 12 months. Our credit portfolios continue to see positive fundamental growth in default characteristics. And we believe we are very well-positioned for a variety of economic scenarios, particularly as approximately 95% of our corporate credit outstanding are [Senior Advisor] (ph). Across Real Assets, we generated gross returns in infrastructure debt of 2.3% for the quarter and 9.7% for the last 12 months. As we highlighted in our Investor Day, our real estate equity strategies are delivering strong returns relative to comparable market equivalents. As Mike discussed, we continue to see positive fundamentals in our real estate portfolios, and we are beginning to see signs of a market recovery, including stable to slightly improving overall values. Our corporate private equity composite had a gross return of 0.4% in the quarter and 0.5% on an LTM basis. The returns in the second quarter were impacted by our large position in Savers Value Village in ACOF V. However, our most recent corporate private equity fund, ACOF VI, generated gross quarterly and 12-month returns of 7.2% and 22.2% respectively, and has a since inception gross internal rate of return of 24.5%. Our corporate private equity portfolios continue to demonstrate strong fundamentals with year-over-year EBITDA growth showing acceleration into the mid-teens. Now I'll turn it back to Mike for closing comments.\nMichael Arougheti: Thanks, Jarrod. At our Investor Day in May, we highlighted the breadth of our platform, the depth of our management team and our focus on generating consistent and high-quality growth with our balance sheet light model. We also highlighted the significant positive secular drivers influencing our business including assets moving out of the banking system to private credit, the significant need for infrastructure investment, consolidation of GP relationships for institutional investors, growing wealth management allocations, and the compelling opportunities in secondaries and insurance. We believe that this quarter's results demonstrate the power of our platform and how we are benefiting from many of these compelling trends. We remain optimistic about the future outlook. We have one of the largest pools of available investment capacity in the alternative investment industry in what we believe will be an improving transaction environment. Investment performance remained strong across our key investment strategies and we continue to see significant investor demand for our products. As always, our talented team collaborating across the globe drives the current and future success of our business, and I'm deeply grateful for their hard work and dedication. And I'm also deeply appreciative of our investors' ongoing support for our company. And operator, we can now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you Mr. Arougheti. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first this morning to Craig Siegenthaler at Bank of America.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you good morning Mike, Jarrod. Hope everyone is doing well. We were looking for an update on the private wealth channel with net flows tripling year-over-year. So at your Investor Day, you laid out the plans to launch two to four more products shortly. So how is that going? It looks like infra secondaries and maybe a retail Pathfinder ABF type vehicles, should give you the biggest gaps? And then I know you're managing capacity pretty tightly with ASIF. When will ASIF join a second or a third wire in the U.S.?\nMichael Arougheti: It's a lot of questions. I will see if I get to all of them, and if we miss one, just let us know. So momentum continues, as we articulated. In Q2, we had $4.5 billion of capital raised across the platform. We are pleased with the scaling that we are seeing in the new products like PMF, ASIF and -- ASIF. Our interval fund continues to see positive flows, and while we have seen slowing net flows in our two REITs, I think unlike some of the peer products, we\u2019re still seeing positive net inflows into those two products as well. We\u2019re in the process of introducing new products into the channel. I\u2019d expect that the next product that we would put in would be in and around our infrastructure business. And as you pointed out, Craig given the breadth of our private credit platform and the success that we are enjoying there, there may be some opportunities to provide dedicated access to certain parts of that franchise as well. ASIF continues to broaden its distribution. We\u2019ve actually been approved on another distribution platform there. And so that is moving forward according to plan. A bright spot also worth mentioning that we did not highlight in the prepared remarks, is the international expansion of our wealth distribution continues to accelerate and 30% to 35% of our flows are now coming from outside of the US market. And so the investments that we are making there to broaden out the distribution are bearing food pretty early in the build-out. I think that was it. Did I miss anything?\nCraig Siegenthaler: No, Mike, you covered it. And just -- do I get a follow-up? I forget if it's one question or one and a follow-up, you guys.\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. Go ahead.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Okay. So my follow-up is on credit quality. And so it is nice to see a positive inflection nonaccruals at ARCC. That's good for Ares. But you guys have always outperformed the industry. So my question is a little more industry related. Is private corporate direct lending, is the industry past the peak in non-accrual defaults and write-downs? Or do you expect the industry to continue to see some deterioration even though your book is getting better?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. Look, I think the longer you go into a cycle like the one that we are in, default rates should go up. And we've been pretty clear on that both in our calls here and at ARCC. But we do not see them going up to a level that we would classify as alarming or approaching what we've seen in COVID or GFC. We remind people that there are things called good old fashioned credit cycles and defaults happen and the market moves on. Yes, we\u2019re outperforming the market and you are beginning to see underperformance in certain portfolios. But I would highlight, given our prominence in the market and some of our other large competitors who are putting up similar types of performance, but I think on an index basis, the credit performance in the private credit space will continue to maybe outperform relative to people's expectations. I would remind folks, and we've talked about this before that a lot of the stresses that we've seen coming through in this cycle has been liquidity driven as a result of the run-up in rates, and not necessarily due to the erosion in earnings. And so now, as we all expect that we're in the front end of the cutting cycle, even if we see earnings can recede, you're going to get some release back from the cut in rates so that will temper future defaults. And the setup from a capital structure standpoint, and this is probably the most important at this point in the cycle relative to past cycle, is just significantly different. And I highlighted where our portfolio sit from a loan-to-value basis in the low 40% range. I believe that the private credit market is comparable, and I would not undervalue how important the amount of equity in these structures is to mitigate future credit deterioration in credit risk. It is just a level of equity subordination that we haven't seen in prior credit cycles. And I think when the story gets written on the other side of this, that that will be a big part of the risk mitigation story. So yes, we are outperforming, but I don't read through that there is a broad based underperformance right now.\nCraig Siegenthaler : Thank you Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. We go next now to Steven Chubak at Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, good morning Mike. Good morning Jarrod. So I wanted to start off with a question just on your M&A strategy. We saw the equity issuance during the quarter. It certainly has prompted more speculation on strategic M&A. Just thinking back to Slide 36 at Investor Day, you listed a number of areas where you might look to grow inorganically. Insurance, Asia real estate, global infra, digital infra were the main 4. Just how would you rank those areas in terms of priority? And with some of the macro indicators softening, expectations for rate cuts, is there any improvement in valuations for potential M&A targets?\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. So look, we\u2019ve highlighted on our Investor Day where we see, if not gaps in our product and capability set, large addressable markets where scale matters. And we may look to inorganically scale up to go after that growth. That view has not changed. The bar continues to be very high, as we've talked about. We want to see a real good strong cultural fit. We want to see strong financial accretion. And we want to be able to have a strategic road map to drive value into any acquired business similar to what we've demonstrated with the acquisition of Landmark and Black Creek and others that we also walked through on the Investor Day. I do think that the prospect for rate cuts will obviously release some pressure and maybe catalyze some deal flow, I can't say for sure. But we are seeing that in the private markets business generally. So I would imagine that that could flow through into the asset management space. But at the end of the day, when you look at where we've been able to do these deals, they tend to be bilateral, noncompetitive. And as we highlighted on the Investor Day, when you look at the acquisition multiples, they have been at pretty attractive levels, and I think we are going to stick to that type of discipline in buying high quality businesses that we can make better at discounts to our trading multiple. In terms of the equity raise, I wouldn't read too much into that. We also talked about on the Investor Day that we continue to invest in a lot of organic growth initiatives. We are launching new businesses, Life sciences is one example, we're investing up and down our wealth product set. So when you look at the size of that raise relative to the market cap of the company that was really just to delever a little bit and position ourselves to continue to invest in growth.\nSteven Chubak: Thanks for that color Mike. And just for my follow-up, on the gross versus net origination dynamic. So gross deployment clearly strong in the quarter also encouraging to see some improvement in that gross to net origination ratio, but still indicating continued elevated levels of refi activity. You noted deployment will likely remain strong in the back half. And just wanted to get a sense as to how you expect that ratio will likely traject. Do you expect further improvement in the back half?\nMichael Arougheti: I think we do. We are obviously -- we have a three to six month forward view on our pipelines. And then as Kort talked about on the ARCC call, the backlog in pipeline just there alone was $3 billion. And when we look at the composition of the pipeline, it is definitely skewing towards new transaction activity and away from the pure refi and kind of incumbent deal flow. We are beginning to see other parts of the platform thaw. Real estate is beginning to show increasing signs of activity after a pretty slow 12 months to 18 months. So I would expect that deployment will hold and then we'll see the gross to net improve. Just as a data point, if you were to go back and look kind of at historical levels our 2023 average gross to net was about 50%. And that has come down dramatically. And so I think that the trend line is in place and I think it's going to continue.\nSteven Chubak: Great color. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We go next now to Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.\nAlex Blostein: Hi, guys. Good morning thank you for the question. I wanted to start with a bit of a discussion on wealth distribution fees and kind of how those dynamics are evolving. So really nice momentum, obviously on gross sales and you have a couple of other products and platforms on the call. What kind of changes are you seeing, if any from how distributors charge for that? We've been hearing this big, maybe a little more kind of harmonization on placement fee structure. So how does that play out? I know there is a little bit of a higher fee that, Jarrod, that you highlighted on the call as well of $50 million. So was that a one-time placement fee from some of the closed-end funds? Or we should expect a just kind of generally higher run rate G&A expense from distribution?\nMichael Arougheti: Can you handle the second, yes?\nJarrod Phillips: Yes. Sounds great. So Alex, that is actually kind of a run rate based on what we did on the wealth management channel for the quarter. So as we see more fundraise in that channel, we would expect to see more expense there. The one thing that I will remind you, which I also had in my prepared remarks is that as we calculate the Part 1 or the FRPR, depending on the product, we do recoup those amounts out of employee expenses first event. It really is about a 40% impact of that overall cost that was through in terms of a margin or G&A expense headwind. But I view that, as much as you can view an expense as a positive, I generally view it as a positive expense because it means that we are continuing to fundraise and that we're continuing to build a base in those products which we can scale off of. And the fact is we are still in the very early innings of these products. So as we build more scale there, these numbers will be smaller and smaller in relation to that scale.\nMichael Arougheti: And I think your question -- in terms of harmonization, I think there is -- the simple answer, without going to all the nuances is, yes directionally, I think there is more harmonization. There is a fair amount of nuance in that answer just in terms of the different products and the different channels and geographies and investor share classes. But I think as the market matures and there is more product proliferation, that you should expect to see more normalization of the structures.\nAlex Blostein: That makes sense. And then, Mike too, one of the things you said earlier when it comes to deployment in your prepared remarks, you highlighted I think being a little bit more selective, maybe I'm paraphrasing a bit. But as you think about the competitive dynamics, whether it is from syndicated markets or from other direct lending players, I guess how are you guys approaching sort of the major buckets of where you're deploying capital right now either by sponsor based or direct to companies and sort of size where you find yourself still generating compelling enough excess returns given the space has gotten more competitive? Thanks.\nMichael Arougheti: Yes, we do. And I thought that Kipp and Kort did a nice job kind of talking about the competitive positioning on the ARCC call, but it's probably worth reminding folks here. We have a very unique origination advantage. A, I think we've been doing it longer than anybody in the market. We do it at a scale that is difficult for people to rival. It is broad-based geographically. It's broad-based by strategy. It is sponsored and is non-sponsored. We have eight highly developed industry verticals that are originating direct to company. And I think most importantly and most differentiated is we have the ability to invest up and down the size spectrum of company in the middle market competing with certain folks in the lower middle market day to day, and what people would call the core market, and then the larger end of the market, whereas I think some of our peers are probably more focused on that upper end of the market. So when we are having this conversation about the reopening of the syndicated loan and high-yield market, that is okay for us. If you look at our CLO performance as one example, we've already achieved a record level of fundraising in our CLO franchise in the first six months of this year. So we're kind of on both sides of that opportunity. And when the liquid markets open up, we see meaningful growth in capital velocity in our liquid business. And when they close, we take advantage of that and we try to capture share at the upper end of our market. But what you saw in the deployment from ARCC and I think it is showing up in the pipeline as well, the ability to pivot down market and capture excess return there is really, really unique. And I think that is a big driver of our ability to deploy in any market environment. And then lastly, and we talk about this a lot, is just incumbency. When you look at the size of the portfolios that we manage around the globe 40% to 60% of the dollars that we are putting out are into incumbent relationships. And so you saw that through 2023, in what was a slow M&A and new issue market we were still deploying at very healthy rates because of the value of that incumbency. So probably a long-winded answer, but I think the deployment continues to be broad based. We have a lot of flexibility to move around the market liquid to illiquid up and down balance sheet, sponsored and non-sponsored, and we'll continue to do that.\nAlex Blostein: Great. Super, helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Brennan Hawken with UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. We know that markets can sometimes overreact, but at least based upon what they are telling us this morning, we are increasingly likely to see rate cuts. And they are actually telling us we might see more than just 25 basis points at a meeting, which seems like long odds at least initially but whatever. So could you remind us about the sensitivity to a 25 basis point drop in short-term rates on FRPR and what the likely offsets would be to that impact?\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. Let us go a little bit deeper than just FRPR because I think it is important for people to understand how it rolls through the different components. But this, again is where the structure of our P&L and the structure of our balance sheet, I think is going to differentiate. And we talk a lot about the importance of balance sheet light versus balance sheet heavy, to smooth out the volatility that you see from sharp changes in valuation and rate moves. So if you were to look at the composition of the P&L first and foremost, we have obviously been a beneficiary of rates staying high on the Part 1 part of the P&L. There are public disclosures in the ARCC 10-Q that walk people through what the sensitivity is. But the good news is what you will see there is that there is a 100 basis point decline in rates just based on the structure of the compensation there. That would have roughly a $9 million impact on FRE. So cut that by four for your 25 basis point question which is sub 1%. But importantly, when rates come down, we typically see transaction volumes pick up. And that decline in Part 1 is typically offset by increased volumes and increased transaction fees. So our experience has been in that part of the P&L, that we have been net beneficiaries. When it comes to FRPR, it is also important to understand that there is a lag effect to your specific question. So typically, when we see rate decline just based on the structure of our investments, there's usually a six month lag effect. But if you were to look at 2024 positioning, if we saw a 25 basis point rate cut in 2024, that would probably have a $0.5 million impact on our FRPR. So again you could multiply that by whatever number you want. And then again, the future impact is going to be a function of what does it mean for earnings performance, valuations, et cetera. But the 2024 impact is de minimis. With regard to our disclosures on European waterfall, I think it is important that people understand that when we are making those calculations and giving you the guidance that we're giving, we're already using the forward yield curve in that guidance. So no surprises there. But in terms of how we expect that to roll through the portfolios, the expectation for cuts is already baked in. From a balance sheet standpoint, obviously balance sheet light, we don't expect any material impact. And in fact obviously given that we borrow under a pretty sizable floating rate revolver, we should see a net benefit from lower interest expense. And then maybe just to wrap all of that together, like I said we expect that the future decline in rates will spur increased capital markets and transaction activity and velocity of capital, which we think is a net -- a net add. And so I feel really good about the rate positioning, and to the extent that rate cuts start sooner than the market originally had underwritten based on today's jobs report, then so be it.\nBrennan Hawken: All right. Thanks for that. That was very helpful, Michael. In your prepared remarks, you indicated signs of recovery in real estate, which is certainly encouraging to hear. Could you maybe drill down a little bit into that? What parts of the market are you beginning to see those signs, how broad-based is it? And how much of that encouraging signs might have to do with the idea we could be getting some relief on the interest rate side which has been a bit of a headwind for that business?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. I think that's a big part of it. Obviously the real estate business is one of the more rate-sensitive parts of the alternative landscape. And so getting rate stability, if not rate reduction, that does have a flow-through impact to transaction markets. And so I think some of the falling that you're beginning to see even ahead of the rate cuts is anticipation of rate reductions. The segments of the market that we focus on just to remind people, in order are industrial logistics and multi-family about 0% industrial, 25% multis for three-quarter of our book. And as we've been talking about all through this rate hiking cycle, the fundamentals at the property level in those markets have continued to be quite strong and the secular demand drivers are still intact. And so there is some fundamental strength that pushes through to transaction volume once you start to see the rates come down and that's part of it as well. The real estate debt business, I'd also say, has been a bright spot for us. Obviously, as we've seen in other parts of the private credit landscape, as the banks are derisking the private markets, have been able to come in and be a pretty reliable capital provider at some pretty attractive rates. And we have seen a meaningful opportunity developing in our US and European debt business as well where we are seeing some pretty healthy deployment.\nBrennan Hawken: That\u2019s great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Bill Katz at TD Cowen.\nBill Katz: Thank you very much for taking my questions. Good morning everybody. So Michael in the opening remarks, you talked about the sort of the shifting demographics of investing with younger folks more interested in alts. How are your conversations going with some of the retirement gatekeepers, particularly in the 401(k), so that's the target date fund area? Is there any building receptivity to opening up sleeve to the alternatives?\nMichael Arougheti: So the answer is we have dedicated teams and efforts underway here to make sure that our product is ready for that market when it opens. To your point, I think some of those logical channel partners are open and hoping to see the DC market open to privates and alternatives. You mentioned target date funds. I do think that will be one way that they find their way in. There are obviously going to be some call it, legal and regulatory headwinds to those markets opening up as quickly as maybe we all would like them to see. But when they do we will be ready, I guess is the best that I can say. But it is going to be a slow path, but one that we are cautiously optimistic will open up in due time.\nBill Katz: Okay. And just one for Jarrod, hate to belabor it. Can you go back to just the offset on the comp side? I wasn't particularly following that related to the distribution? And then just stepping back maybe give us an update on the flight path to the 45% margin for this year and then the sort of sequential rise as we look out to '28? Thank you.\nJarrod Phillips: Sure. And the first part of the question there. when you think about these distribution fees that we pay, what we make sure is that we don't pay out comp on our Part 1 or FRPR before we recapture those. So typically, what you've seen in Part 1 and FRPR is a 60-40 split, so 40% margin there. You will see that those ratios were actually having a better margin, and that's a result of us making sure that we are repaid for those distribution costs prior to paying any employee expenses. So that means that the house is kind of sharing 60-40 the expense with the compensation pool. And I'm happy to walk you through more on the mechanics there, but that's essentially where it works if you just take the total amount that we would otherwise earn and reduce from the expenses. In terms of margin, we talked about this in Investor Day, our focus is, first and foremost in high-quality growth. And sometimes high quality growth comes with the costs prior to we see -- seeing revenues for it. In doing so, though we know that because of the way we are built, generally, you'll see margin expand based on our deployment. So we walked through and I walked through at Investor Day is that we would be somewhere in the 0 basis points to 150 basis points in any given year. And if you look at where we're at now, I think we're about 130 basis points up over last year. So as we continue to see deployment we will continue to see expansion of that margin, but it's going to be kind of at the speed of what deployment is. So you'll have some times where it will spike and you will have sometimes where it will be more flat. Certainly a little bit of these distribution fees coming in is somewhat of a tailwind -- or a headwind to it. And as I mentioned earlier in my response, that as we build scale in those products, these are onetime fees as you raise them, so they don't recur annually, so there will be a smaller percentage of the overall management fees that we are earning from these products going into future periods. So that is another way that margin will expand moving forward.\nBill Katz: Thank you very much.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Ben Budish at Barclays.\nBen Budish: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Maybe first on the state of competition in credit. Mike, you talked about some of the areas in which you're leaning into some of your advantages. Some of the media headlines would indicate that loan documentations either becoming looser or more flexible in response to competition. I was wondering if you could talk to the degree to what you're seeing that things like increasing inclusion of PIK optionality, things like that. To what degree are you seeing that sort of increase in the deals you're doing?\nMichael Arougheti: I'll try to give a simple answer to a \u2013 it is not actually a simple question because it goes back to some of my earlier comments just about the structure of the market. So in my oversimplified view of your lower middle market, traditional middle market and upper middle market I think it's safe to say that generally in the lower middle market in traditional middle market you have seen very little, if any of the large market structural deterioration find its way into those markets. When you start to get into the upper end of the middle market in competition, with both the liquid markets and the larger credit providers, you will see some but not nearly to the same extent as the traded markets, some deterioration in structure, which I would argue in many cases could be said to be appropriate because they are higher quality, sometimes larger borrowers that can command that type of structure. But most of the things that people should be concerned about in terms of the liability management loopholes and things that the media tends to focus on, those are really not present in the middle market. I think there is been an extraordinary amount of discipline despite the perception of increased competition on documents. Kipp and Kort again on the ARCC call addressed this as well in saying that, when you look at where we're turning transaction down, it is largely going to be over documents, and it could be some fairly simple or seemingly simple things that we will pass on if we don't feel that we have the ability to exercise our creditor rights when we need to -- the way that we need to. So I do think the media is probably overblowing it relative to the broad middle market. And even at the upper end in relation to the liquid market, it's really not that pervasive. I think PIK is a different question, and again, not to go down a PIK rabbit hole, PIK in today's market is not necessarily an indicator of structural deterioration. I\u2019d encourage people to think about it as a way for private credit managers to capture excess return at a time when base rates are high. And so if you are thinking about prudently structuring your leverage and managing to a sustainable interest coverage ratio and not constraining the cash flow of a company and constraining their ability to execute their business and growth plan, then PIK is the way that you are going to capture excess return and support your borrowers. So you have to differentiate between PIK that is intentional at the outset versus maybe PIK that is used to reduce default, et cetera, et cetera. But again, that is not really the same as some of the other structural deteriorations that people like to think about. And again, when you look at our approach to pick in the corporate credit book, it is more of the former than the latter.\nBen Budish: Got it. Very helpful. And then maybe just a quick follow-up. Just given the size of the latest SDL Fund, how do you think about sort of the future of the fund structure there? Does it make sense to continue to scale up these drawdown funds? Or to what degree will you continue to maybe raise or -- to an outsized degree from more perpetual strategies that could potentially be more scalable? Thank you.\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. I think this is a place that we've been quite vocal. Craig brought it up earlier as we said that we were kind of tempering growth despite the high growth in places like ASIF. You have seen us raising equity and scaling ARCC. And now you are seeing in SDL III. We have learned over the 30 years that we've been doing this that it is critically important that you are diversified in your distribution and funding sources. We have a pretty good handle going into any year or years, as to what we think our deployment capacity is, and we structure our capital to meet that deployment capacity. So SDL has been investing already as we have raised, we're about $9 billion in the ground on that fund. So it is deploying at the expected pace. But we never want to be beholden to one fund or one channel because in different parts in the cycle, those will open or close. So if the non-traded market sees a slowdown in appetite, we want to make sure that we have other forms of capital that can actually meet the deployment demand. Similarly, as we get closer to end of fund life on some of our commingled, you may see us turn on managed accounts or the public entities. It's critically important that people understand that diversity of funding is a big driver of how we actually create value here, and we'll continue to do it. So I don't think we will ever give up on this complement of funds that we have open-ended, closed-ended, perpetual offer, campaign, traded, non-traded. It is a big part of how we run the business.\nBen Budish: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Ken Worthington at JPMorgan.\nKen Worthington: Hi. Thanks for squeeze me and at the end here. We're almost 18 months beyond the regional bank crisis. I think Ares considered the opportunity to come in various different phases for Ares over time. What phase would you consider us to be in now? And what do you see as the opportunity for Ares kind of going forward? And does a more benign interest rate environment alter the opportunity set that you see going forward?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. I wouldn't say that it alters the opportunity set. I mean, Just to reiterate, I think what you are referring to, we've talked about the different phases. One was obviously an early phase where there is just certain portfolios that were distressed or certain balance sheets that were distressed that needed resolution either through asset sales or risk transfer transactions. And there is still some of that going on. But given the continued strength in the economy now, the prospect for rates, you may see less of that. There still is a pretty significant amount of assets sitting on bank balance sheets that will need to get resolved either for credit reasons or regulatory capital reasons. And so I don't think, that means that the types of deals that we\u2019re seeing are not going to happen. They just may not be happening at the same velocity. We are now I think transitioning to the next phase which we've talked about -- which is a much more sustained opportunity is that in the wake of that crisis and the wake of increased regulatory capital pressure. You will begin to see more of these assets finding their way into the private markets. And that is actually a more consistent opportunity set for places like our alternative credit business and our real estate lending business, to name a few. So I think that transition is underway. We are seeing it in the composition of our pipelines. But even with rates coming down, just given some of the acute stresses on certain bank balance sheets, I wouldn't rule out that you'll continue to see a decent amount of portfolio trades and continued risk transfer deals as well.\nKen Worthington: Okay. Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: And we'll go next now to Patrick Davitt at Autonomous Research.\nPatrick Davitt: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon everyone. Most of mine have been asked, but maybe a broader macro one. It strikes me that everything you're saying today is a pretty dramatic contrast with what the market thinks is happening today. So from what you can see across your borrowers, PE companies, et cetera, I guess the jobs report today, do you see this as an overreaction? Or do you think there is a real potential evolution towards seeing a path to maybe slower economic growth and thus more cuts than maybe you and your competitors have been talking about just a couple of months ago? Thanks.\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. We've talked about this so lot. I mean the best we can do -- we don't have a crystal ball, but we have data that we see in our private market portfolios that is telling us something different. And we've been consistent on that. So two years ago, when the markets were calling for a recession, we weren't. And so we try not to get worked up as long-term investors in any one singular headline. We obviously already talked about that if rate cuts get pulled forward both in terms of timing and magnitude I think the business is very well-positioned for that transition. But we are not seeing anything in our private portfolios that would argue for what we are seeing in the market today. It is interesting because as a private market practitioner that runs a public company, I'm often struck at just the volatility and schizophrenia that you can see in the interpretation of data that comes out in the public markets. And month to month, good news, is bad news and bad news, is good news. And today I guess, okay news is bad news. We just try to look at the facts as we see them and make sure that we are well positioned. But I personally feel -- I feel like it is an overreaction, but we'll keep collecting data and react accordingly.\nPatrick Davitt: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Michael Cyprys at Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just wanted to ask on the non-sponsored business that you guys have just if could share an update on that just in terms of non-sponsored direct lending, remind us of the size of that platform and some of the initiatives that you have for broadening that out particularly as banks are looking to run with more capital-efficient balance sheets. And then just curious how you would expect the pace of activity there at non-sponsor to evolve over the next 12 months, as compared to your larger sponsor direct lending business. Thank you.\nMichael Arougheti: Sure. As I said, we have right now about eight industry teams that we deploy across the private credit business. They are originating direct to corporate and they are supporting our sponsor-led originators and deal teams when a sponsor is actually investing in a company in that industry. So it's kind of a double benefit of that we are actually able to increase our non-sponsored origination. But also, I think do a better job underwriting in some of these markets. The non-sponsored business, just given the size of the markets and the importance of sponsor, will continue to grow on an aggregate dollar basis. But I'm not sure that we'll get it to a place where it's kind of going to overwhelm the sponsor backed opportunity. But order of magnitude, just to give you a sense, if you were to look at our non-sponsored origination just in our direct lending business, and there's a pull-through effect to other parts of the business, it's probably somewhere between 5% and 10%. So it's meaningful aggregate dollars, but it's not going to move the needle in any given period. It's highly differentiated, particularly in some of these core verticals like sports media and entertainment or life sciences where we've been early both in adding people and capital. So we'll keep making those investments.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: And we'll go next now to Brian Bedell at Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. Mike, just to follow on the last couple of questions on maybe on deployment as we sort of move into the back half of this year and come into 2025, just in this -- I guess, only a couple of days in here. But a very recent environment obviously, where per sentiment is shifting negative. To the extent that we have more market volatility and at least temporary financial stress in the system. How could that impact your deployment plans for the second half? Would that actually help you because potentially bank sponsors would pull back? Or would it freeze-up deployment temporarily potentially?\nMichael Arougheti: Yes. So the way I think people need to begin to understand the deployment is the deployment geography will change right? So if you go back and you look at 2023 where new transaction volume was constrained, you would have seen increased deal activity within the incumbent portfolios and in places like opportunistic credit, alternative credit and secondaries because they are going to be that liquidity provider into the dislocated market. Then you transition to a healthy market and you'll see volumes ramp up in the liquid side of the business and new issue volumes increasing in the direct lending market. And if we go into a more volatile market and banks pull back, et cetera, then you'll shift it again. So because of the diversity of strategies that we manage and the diversity of geographies that we manage them in, the volatility of deployment is reducing over time. And so yes, I continue to believe that just based on the weight of capital, the aging of the installed base of private equity, rate cuts having a corollary impact on valuations and the cost of capital I still think that we are going to see pretty healthy deployment into the back half of the year, today's market move notwithstanding. But if for whatever reason, the market has got too nervous then we are going to find other parts where our capital is going to be more relevant and we would kind of be deploying there as well. So I think we are in a really good spot.\nBrian Bedell: That's helpful. And maybe just one on retail. Any interest in doing a deal like what we saw was obviously take care in capital in terms of a hybrid structure with retail products to a much wider distribution? Or you like your strategy as it is now?\nMichael Arougheti: Well, as of now, that's just a headline. I don't know if anybody really knows what that deal actually looks like. So I can't opine as to whether or not we would do something like that or not. We have partnered with more traditional asset management platforms over the years through various sub-advisory agreements and partnerships to bring private markets into some of those portfolios, and that's been a part of our diversification of distribution historically. So I would expect that type of thing would continue. We would be open to it. I think I would just go back to some of our comments around our Investor Day, is that we are very focused on what I would call high quality growth. And what I mean by that is sustainable growth at high fee rate, high margin where we are maximizing the value of our origination. Because at the end of the day the binding constraint to growth and profitability for anybody in our business is going to be our ability to source unique assets. And how we then deliver those assets to our clients whether they are institutional or retail, is another side of the equation. But from the Ares Management shareholder perspective our goal is to make sure that we maximize the profitability of that origination. And so I don't -- again not knowing what those partnerships look like, it\u2019s very expensive to originate and portfolio-manage the type of assets that we do. They do require a high fee rate which is why our average fee rate is 1.1%. And so we have to be very careful that when we start talking about private markets within traditional portfolios that people don't go down the rabbit hole of thinking they can access difficult to access non-correlated unique private outcomes at public market rates. So we think a lot about it. We have very deep relationships with many of the traditional managers at the highest levels of the firms. But the calculus as to whether or not to enter into any partnership like that is going to really go back to what I said earlier, is what's our capacity to deploy and is there a benefit in diversifying the distribution into that channel against that deployment. And so I think that's a TBD.\nBrian Bedell: Okay. Great. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And gentlemen, it appears we have no further questions today. Mr. Arougheti, I'll turn things back to you, sir for any closing comments.\nMichael Arougheti: Great. We appreciate it. Thank you for the great questions and the time today. And we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Enjoy the rest of the summer.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Arougheti. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our conference call for today.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jarrod Phillips",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike and good morning, everyone. As Mike said, we continued to deliver strong results in the second quarter. The year-over-year growth of 22% in FRE along with mid- to high teens growth in AUM, management fees and realized income. The record $26 billion we raised in the second quarter helped drive a 29% increase in our AUM not yet paying fees, ideally situating us to capitalize on growing activity levels, as the markets return to a more normalized state of deployment and realizations in many sectors. When you combine this AUM not yet paying fees with our FRE-rich earnings mix and future European waterfall realization potential, we believe we offer strong visibility for future earnings to our stockholders. Taking a look at this quarter's earnings, starting with revenues. Our management fees totaled over $726 million in the quarter, an increase of 17% compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by positive net deployment of our AUM not yet paying fees. Fee-related performance revenues totaled $21.6 million in the second quarter primarily from our non-traded private equity secondaries product, APMF, along with select credit products [indiscernible]. The $15.2 million of FRPR from APMF benefited from AUM growth, which recently reached approximately $1.6 billion in total assets and was aided by a sizable portfolio purchased in the quarter. We would expect AUM growth in APMF to provide long-term tailwinds for additional FRPR generation. However, FRPR from APMF will be more episodic and accordingly, more difficult to project spikes in FRPR like the one that occurrence. As a reminder, we anticipate realizing 95% or more of our credit FRPR in the fourth quarter. I do want to point out two expenses running through our G&A in the second quarter. First, our Q2 G&A expenses were impacted by our first ever firm-wide AGM held in May. Typically, we hold multiple investor events resulting in cost spread throughout the year instead of being incurred in a single quarter. As a result of this quarterly spike in annual meeting costs, we expect G&A expenses in the second half of the year will benefit from fewer event expenses. Second as we continue to scale our wealth management distribution, we incur greater supplemental distribution fees. These fees totaled $15.3 million in the second quarter, an increase of $6.2 million compared to Q1. Importantly, these fees will be partially offset as we recoup the majority of these expenses over time by reducing employee compensation paid with respect to Part 1 fees or FRPR for the associated funds. In the quarter, FRE totaled approximately $325 million, 22% from the previous year driven by higher management fees and a margin improvement of 130 basis points to 42.1%. In the second quarter, we generated more than $40 million of net realized performance income, driven mainly by credit funds European style waterfalls. Realized income in the second quarter was $363 million a 16% increase over the previous year. And after-tax realized income per share of Class A common stock was $0.99, up 10% from the second quarter of 2023. As of June 30 our AUM stood at $447 billion up 18% from the year ago period. Our fee paying AUM reached $276 million at the end of the quarter, up 14% from the previous year. Following sustained fundraising momentum, our AUM not yet paying fees available for future deployment increased to approximately $71 billion at quarter end, representing $675 million in potential annual management fees. Our incentive eligible AUM increased by 17% compared to the second quarter of 2023, reaching $259 billion. Of this amount, over $86 billion is uninvested, representing significant performance income potential. In the second quarter, our net accrued performance income declined slightly to $919 million, primarily due to a reversal of carried interest in certain corporate private equity and opportunistic credit funds, due to the change in the stock price of our position in Savers Value Village. This was partially offset by growth in our net accrued performance income and our credit strategies as the performance, driven by interest income, meaningfully exceeded the hurdle rates. Of the $919 million of net accrued performance income at quarter-end, $783 million, just over 85%, was in European style waterfall funds with nearly $460 million from funds that are out of their reinvestment periods. For the second half of 2024, we are estimating an additional $60 million to $70 million of net realized performance income from European style funds with nearly all of that amount recognized in the fourth quarter. For 2025, we estimate our 2025 European style net realized performance income will be in a range of $225 million to $275 million. The slight decrease in our 2025 estimate is primarily related to one fund where we currently anticipate our realization timing could shift from the end of 2025 to 2026. However the total net realized performance income expected over the life of this one fund is largely unchanged. For 2025, it is best to assume that 60% of our annual European style performance income will be realized in the quarter, 30% in the second quarter and about 10% spread across the third and first quarters with [indiscernible]. The current seasonality of our European style waterfall realizations, primarily due to the early stage of our larger eligible credit funds that make tax distributions which we realize as net performance income compared to older smaller European style funds which are realizing the full net performance income payable near the end of their fund life. The seasonality will persist as several of our larger European funds start regularly realizing performance income, towards the end of their fund lives potentially beginning in 2026. Finally, I would like to discuss our recent fund performance, which is highlighted by broad outperformance within our private credit strategies. Across our credit group, our strategy composites all generated double-digit gross returns over the past 12 months. Our credit portfolios continue to see positive fundamental growth in default characteristics. And we believe we are very well-positioned for a variety of economic scenarios, particularly as approximately 95% of our corporate credit outstanding are [Senior Advisor] (ph). Across Real Assets, we generated gross returns in infrastructure debt of 2.3% for the quarter and 9.7% for the last 12 months. As we highlighted in our Investor Day, our real estate equity strategies are delivering strong returns relative to comparable market equivalents. As Mike discussed, we continue to see positive fundamentals in our real estate portfolios, and we are beginning to see signs of a market recovery, including stable to slightly improving overall values. Our corporate private equity composite had a gross return of 0.4% in the quarter and 0.5% on an LTM basis. The returns in the second quarter were impacted by our large position in Savers Value Village in ACOF V. However, our most recent corporate private equity fund, ACOF VI, generated gross quarterly and 12-month returns of 7.2% and 22.2% respectively, and has a since inception gross internal rate of return of 24.5%. Our corporate private equity portfolios continue to demonstrate strong fundamentals with year-over-year EBITDA growth showing acceleration into the mid-teens. Now I'll turn it back to Mike for closing comments. Yes. Sounds great. So Alex, that is actually kind of a run rate based on what we did on the wealth management channel for the quarter. So as we see more fundraise in that channel, we would expect to see more expense there. The one thing that I will remind you, which I also had in my prepared remarks is that as we calculate the Part 1 or the FRPR, depending on the product, we do recoup those amounts out of employee expenses first event. It really is about a 40% impact of that overall cost that was through in terms of a margin or G&A expense headwind. But I view that, as much as you can view an expense as a positive, I generally view it as a positive expense because it means that we are continuing to fundraise and that we're continuing to build a base in those products which we can scale off of. And the fact is we are still in the very early innings of these products. So as we build more scale there, these numbers will be smaller and smaller in relation to that scale. Sure. And the first part of the question there. when you think about these distribution fees that we pay, what we make sure is that we don't pay out comp on our Part 1 or FRPR before we recapture those. So typically, what you've seen in Part 1 and FRPR is a 60-40 split, so 40% margin there. You will see that those ratios were actually having a better margin, and that's a result of us making sure that we are repaid for those distribution costs prior to paying any employee expenses. So that means that the house is kind of sharing 60-40 the expense with the compensation pool. And I'm happy to walk you through more on the mechanics there, but that's essentially where it works if you just take the total amount that we would otherwise earn and reduce from the expenses. In terms of margin, we talked about this in Investor Day, our focus is, first and foremost in high-quality growth. And sometimes high quality growth comes with the costs prior to we see -- seeing revenues for it. In doing so, though we know that because of the way we are built, generally, you'll see margin expand based on our deployment. So we walked through and I walked through at Investor Day is that we would be somewhere in the 0 basis points to 150 basis points in any given year. And if you look at where we're at now, I think we're about 130 basis points up over last year. So as we continue to see deployment we will continue to see expansion of that margin, but it's going to be kind of at the speed of what deployment is. So you'll have some times where it will spike and you will have sometimes where it will be more flat. Certainly a little bit of these distribution fees coming in is somewhat of a tailwind -- or a headwind to it. And as I mentioned earlier in my response, that as we build scale in those products, these are onetime fees as you raise them, so they don't recur annually, so there will be a smaller percentage of the overall management fees that we are earning from these products going into future periods. So that is another way that margin will expand moving forward."

The macroeconomic backdrop for our business improved in the second quarter with a stronger transaction environment, solid and stable credit trends and recovering real estate market. Improving economic picture is driven by a combination of a better outlook for both inflation and interest rates, continued labor market strength and increased confidence in the soft landing. Given the more constructive transaction environment, we were more active across many of our investment strategies. In fact, we invested $26 billion in Q2, our second highest quarter on record and more than 70% higher than the same quarter a year ago. As we highlighted at our Investor Day in May, we're continuing to see significant institutional and retail demand globally for our alternative investment products, particularly within broad credit strategies, but also in opportunistic and value-add real estate, affiliated insurance, infrastructure, and a host of secondary strategies. Q2 was our single best quarter fundraising in our history with $26 billion in gross capital raised, bringing the total year-to-date funds raised to $43 billion. For the second quarter our assets under management grew to a record $447 billion up 18% versus a year ago. Our strong deployment and fundraising activities supported a 22% year-over-year growth in fee-related earnings for the quarter. We also had another strong quarter of fund performance as Jarrod will highlight later. Overall, we are pleased with our momentum, the firm's positioning, and the promising outlook for our business. As we've expected for some time, we\u2019re seeing a gradual improvement in transaction volume this year for a variety of reasons; the nearly $1 trillion in private equity dry powder that's aging, significant demand from LPs for a return of capital, a stable rate backdrop and the improving prospects for interest rate cuts, and an economy that remains on solid footing. For Ares, looking across our seven private credit strategies in our credit and real asset groups activity was very strong in the second quarter with gross deployment up over 58% year-over-year. In Q2, we deployed approximately $20 billion in our private credit strategies with net deployment totaling $7.7 billion, more than double Q1 net deployment of $3.3 billion. Looking forward, our investment pipeline suggests continued solid activity, and we have every indication that the second half of the year will continue to be an active deployment environment. The credit quality across our corporate credit assets remains very strong and recent trends indicate stability. As an example our US direct lending portfolio companies experienced their second straight quarter of improving organic EBITDA growth reaching 11% year-over-year. The portfolio's loan-to-value ratio remains in the low 40% range which is meaningfully below historical average market levels and portfolio company leverage multiples are 0.5 turn lower than the prior year. For instance, on its earnings call, ARCC reported a decline in loans on non-accrual to 1.5% and a decline in underperforming loans. Based on the fundamentals that we are seeing across our US and European corporate credit book, our outlook is for continued solid economic growth in these markets and continued favorable credit performance. That said, we are intensely focused on executing our playbook in more active and therefore, competitive markets by out originating our competition using our deep incumbency advantages, performing rigorous fundamental due diligence, negotiating tight documentation structures and staying highly selective. In our real estate strategies, we are seeing market valuations and transaction activity stabilize. Operating fundamentals such as rents and occupancy rates remain positive for our core focus areas of industrial and multifamily, which represented nearly three-quarters of our asset value. Within these segments, we continue to benefit from the growth in e-commerce, onshoring and positive longer-term supply demand dynamics. Our deliberate strategy of extending the duration of our industrial lease terms is enabling us to effectively navigate the market as near-term peak levels of supply are being digested. We are also seeing positive trends in adjacent areas such as student housing, single-family rental and self-storage. Based upon the improving market trends, our real estate team was significantly more active in the second quarter, with deployment more than doubling the year ago period, and our pipeline for new transactions continues to build. We also see significant investment opportunities in data centers and the digital infrastructure needed to support the enormous demands of AI growth. We are investing in digital infrastructure across our various businesses but particularly within infrastructure, alternative credit and real estate. Collectively, we have committed nearly $5 billion in digital-related infrastructure, including data centers, towers and new fiber broadband installations over the past five years. We are also focused on climate infrastructure opportunities and are actively investing in new clean energy projects, including solar, wind and renewable natural gas. Over the past five years, we've committed approximately $3.2 billion in debt and equity investments in these sectors to meet the growing energy needs across the US. Within our secondaries businesses, we continue to see opportunities for new investments across our range of liquidity solutions including purchasing LP portfolios, working with GPs on continuation funds, and providing structured solutions for both GPs and LPs. Overall, the secondary market opportunity remains robust as managers and investors alike try to manage liquidity demands in what has been a transitioning valuation environment and a slower M&A and IPO market. Now let me provide some color on our record fundraising quarter. Across our broad distribution channels, we continue to benefit from increased investor allocations to alternatives a loyal and expanding client base, and our growing scale. All three of our primary fundraising channels; institutional, wealth and insurance are highly productive, and we are seeing a meaningful acceleration in fundraising across our wealth management channel which has more than tripled so far this year compared to last year. Our broad offering of credit strategies continues to lead the way, as our benefits of scale and track record are differentiating factors. In Q2 we raised nearly $20 billion in funds managed accounts and CLOs within our credit group. As you may have seen from earlier this week, we announced the final closing for our US focused Senior Direct Lending Fund III or SDL III, with $33.6 billion of investment capacity. This is the largest institutional private credit fund in the market and is roughly double the $14.9 billion of total investment capital that we raised in SDL II. SDL III's investment capacity included $15.3 billion in fund equity commitments along with related vehicles, closed leverage and anticipated leverage of up to $8 billion that could be raised over the next 12 months. We raised $6.4 billion of capital in Q2 and another $1.8 billion in July for this fund. We're also well underway investing SDL III, having already committed $9 billion of capital to more than 165 companies to-date. With respect to our other large private credit institutional fund in the market, Ares' VI European Direct Lending Fund, we raised another EUR750 million of equity commitments in the second quarter. This brings total equity commitments to EUR12.2 billion today or over EUR18 billion of total investment capacity including anticipated leverage. We expect to raise another EUR1 billion to EUR1.5 billion in equity commitments in the third quarter with additional commitments in the final close expected in Q4. During the quarter, we also continued to raise various funds within our liquid and illiquid credit strategies across our platform. One example is the launch of our Specialty Healthcare Fund, which focuses on direct loans to life sciences companies. We are currently holding our initial closings for this inaugural fund, and we expect to receive commitments totaling approximately $750 million in the coming weeks. We believe that this is a great start for a new product. In addition, we've priced five new CLOs in the quarter. Year-to-date, we've already priced seven CLOs, raising $3.6 billion, exceeding our full year record of seven CLOs for $3.3 billion in 2022. Overall we have raised over $65 billion in the past 18 months across our direct lending strategies. When combined with our fundraising across our other private credit strategies in alternative credit, APAC credit, real estate debt and infrastructure debt, we've raised approximately $85 billion in private credit AUM over the past 18 months. In our Real Assets Group, we are aiming to hold a final close in the third quarter for our fourth US Opportunistic Real Estate Fund, bringing total commitments to $2.7 billion. Based on this anticipated final close size, we expect the fund will exceed the commitments of its predecessor fund by 59% and we believe that this demonstrates meaningful investor support for the strategy and the investment opportunity. We are also off to a great start with our recently launched fourth European Value-Add Real Estate Fund raising approximately EUR600 million in the second quarter, including related vehicles, with additional capital expected for the first close in the third quarter. We also raised another $1.1 billion in our US Real Estate Debt Strategy, as we continue to see attractive values and compelling market dynamics with less competition in this sector. In addition to significant fundraising in our commingled funds, we're also seeing meaningful demand for managed accounts across the platform. For the second quarter and year-to-date periods, we raised $5.4 billion and over $10 billion, respectively, in new commitments in these managed accounts. As I stated earlier, our wealth management business continues to have significant momentum as we penetrate existing distribution, expand into new channels, market to new geographies and broaden our product set. We are in the early phases of the largest generational wealth transfer in history, and importantly we believe that we are seeing a very divergent trend with how baby boomers and the younger generations invest. Baby boomers manage their investment wealth primarily in stocks and bonds, but younger investors are seeking to expand their investing toolkit, by optimizing their portfolios with increased allocations to private market assets. This trend could have significant positive implications for growing wealth allocations, and we believe that we are beginning to see these trends play out in our current results. During the second quarter we raised more than $2.5 billion in new equity commitments across our six non-traded products, and inclusive of leverage we raised $4.5 billion. For the year-to-date period new equity commitments totaled over $4.5 billion which is over 3.5 times the capital raised in the same period a year ago. Since our last earnings call, we've launched certain non-traded solutions with three additional global distribution partners. Based on these expanded partnerships, we expect flows into our wealth focused products to continue to gain momentum through the second half of the year. Aspida, our minority-owned insurance affiliate is on a strong growth trajectory. This quarter it secured nearly $600 million in additional institutional equity from third party investors. With more equity capital expected to be raised in Q3 Aspida is well capitalized and poised for continued expansion. The annuity market is thriving with sales exceeding a record $400 billion on an annualized run rate in the first half of 2024. Aspida is benefiting from these industry tailwinds, experiencing robust flows from new retail annuity sales, and increased flow reinsurance opportunities. So overall, with $43 billion raised in the first 6 months, we're ahead of where we expected to be in midyear, and we believe that we're in a better position to match or potentially exceed the $74.5 billion that we raised in 2023. Our strong first half puts us in an excellent position with record amounts of available capital to deploy. Looking ahead to the next six months, our fundraising is likely to see contributions from a broader and more diverse set of funds. For the year, we expect to have 35 funds in the market across 17 strategies to take advantage of the expected growth in alternative asset allocations. And I will now turn the call over to Jarrod to discuss our financial results in more detail. Jarrod? Thanks, Jarrod. At our Investor Day in May, we highlighted the breadth of our platform, the depth of our management team and our focus on generating consistent and high-quality growth with our balance sheet light model. We also highlighted the significant positive secular drivers influencing our business including assets moving out of the banking system to private credit, the significant need for infrastructure investment, consolidation of GP relationships for institutional investors, growing wealth management allocations, and the compelling opportunities in secondaries and insurance. We believe that this quarter's results demonstrate the power of our platform and how we are benefiting from many of these compelling trends. We remain optimistic about the future outlook. We have one of the largest pools of available investment capacity in the alternative investment industry in what we believe will be an improving transaction environment. Investment performance remained strong across our key investment strategies and we continue to see significant investor demand for our products. As always, our talented team collaborating across the globe drives the current and future success of our business, and I'm deeply grateful for their hard work and dedication. And I'm also deeply appreciative of our investors' ongoing support for our company. And operator, we can now open up the line for questions. It's a lot of questions. I will see if I get to all of them, and if we miss one, just let us know. So momentum continues, as we articulated. In Q2, we had $4.5 billion of capital raised across the platform. We are pleased with the scaling that we are seeing in the new products like PMF, ASIF and -- ASIF. Our interval fund continues to see positive flows, and while we have seen slowing net flows in our two REITs, I think unlike some of the peer products, we\u2019re still seeing positive net inflows into those two products as well. We\u2019re in the process of introducing new products into the channel. I\u2019d expect that the next product that we would put in would be in and around our infrastructure business. And as you pointed out, Craig given the breadth of our private credit platform and the success that we are enjoying there, there may be some opportunities to provide dedicated access to certain parts of that franchise as well. ASIF continues to broaden its distribution. We\u2019ve actually been approved on another distribution platform there. And so that is moving forward according to plan. A bright spot also worth mentioning that we did not highlight in the prepared remarks, is the international expansion of our wealth distribution continues to accelerate and 30% to 35% of our flows are now coming from outside of the US market. And so the investments that we are making there to broaden out the distribution are bearing food pretty early in the build-out. I think that was it. Did I miss anything? Yes. Go ahead. Yes. Look, I think the longer you go into a cycle like the one that we are in, default rates should go up. And we've been pretty clear on that both in our calls here and at ARCC. But we do not see them going up to a level that we would classify as alarming or approaching what we've seen in COVID or GFC. We remind people that there are things called good old fashioned credit cycles and defaults happen and the market moves on. Yes, we\u2019re outperforming the market and you are beginning to see underperformance in certain portfolios. But I would highlight, given our prominence in the market and some of our other large competitors who are putting up similar types of performance, but I think on an index basis, the credit performance in the private credit space will continue to maybe outperform relative to people's expectations. I would remind folks, and we've talked about this before that a lot of the stresses that we've seen coming through in this cycle has been liquidity driven as a result of the run-up in rates, and not necessarily due to the erosion in earnings. And so now, as we all expect that we're in the front end of the cutting cycle, even if we see earnings can recede, you're going to get some release back from the cut in rates so that will temper future defaults. And the setup from a capital structure standpoint, and this is probably the most important at this point in the cycle relative to past cycle, is just significantly different. And I highlighted where our portfolio sit from a loan-to-value basis in the low 40% range. I believe that the private credit market is comparable, and I would not undervalue how important the amount of equity in these structures is to mitigate future credit deterioration in credit risk. It is just a level of equity subordination that we haven't seen in prior credit cycles. And I think when the story gets written on the other side of this, that that will be a big part of the risk mitigation story. So yes, we are outperforming, but I don't read through that there is a broad based underperformance right now. Sure. So look, we\u2019ve highlighted on our Investor Day where we see, if not gaps in our product and capability set, large addressable markets where scale matters. And we may look to inorganically scale up to go after that growth. That view has not changed. The bar continues to be very high, as we've talked about. We want to see a real good strong cultural fit. We want to see strong financial accretion. And we want to be able to have a strategic road map to drive value into any acquired business similar to what we've demonstrated with the acquisition of Landmark and Black Creek and others that we also walked through on the Investor Day. I do think that the prospect for rate cuts will obviously release some pressure and maybe catalyze some deal flow, I can't say for sure. But we are seeing that in the private markets business generally. So I would imagine that that could flow through into the asset management space. But at the end of the day, when you look at where we've been able to do these deals, they tend to be bilateral, noncompetitive. And as we highlighted on the Investor Day, when you look at the acquisition multiples, they have been at pretty attractive levels, and I think we are going to stick to that type of discipline in buying high quality businesses that we can make better at discounts to our trading multiple. In terms of the equity raise, I wouldn't read too much into that. We also talked about on the Investor Day that we continue to invest in a lot of organic growth initiatives. We are launching new businesses, Life sciences is one example, we're investing up and down our wealth product set. So when you look at the size of that raise relative to the market cap of the company that was really just to delever a little bit and position ourselves to continue to invest in growth. I think we do. We are obviously -- we have a three to six month forward view on our pipelines. And then as Kort talked about on the ARCC call, the backlog in pipeline just there alone was $3 billion. And when we look at the composition of the pipeline, it is definitely skewing towards new transaction activity and away from the pure refi and kind of incumbent deal flow. We are beginning to see other parts of the platform thaw. Real estate is beginning to show increasing signs of activity after a pretty slow 12 months to 18 months. So I would expect that deployment will hold and then we'll see the gross to net improve. Just as a data point, if you were to go back and look kind of at historical levels our 2023 average gross to net was about 50%. And that has come down dramatically. And so I think that the trend line is in place and I think it's going to continue. Can you handle the second, yes? And I think your question -- in terms of harmonization, I think there is -- the simple answer, without going to all the nuances is, yes directionally, I think there is more harmonization. There is a fair amount of nuance in that answer just in terms of the different products and the different channels and geographies and investor share classes. But I think as the market matures and there is more product proliferation, that you should expect to see more normalization of the structures. Yes, we do. And I thought that Kipp and Kort did a nice job kind of talking about the competitive positioning on the ARCC call, but it's probably worth reminding folks here. We have a very unique origination advantage. A, I think we've been doing it longer than anybody in the market. We do it at a scale that is difficult for people to rival. It is broad-based geographically. It's broad-based by strategy. It is sponsored and is non-sponsored. We have eight highly developed industry verticals that are originating direct to company. And I think most importantly and most differentiated is we have the ability to invest up and down the size spectrum of company in the middle market competing with certain folks in the lower middle market day to day, and what people would call the core market, and then the larger end of the market, whereas I think some of our peers are probably more focused on that upper end of the market. So when we are having this conversation about the reopening of the syndicated loan and high-yield market, that is okay for us. If you look at our CLO performance as one example, we've already achieved a record level of fundraising in our CLO franchise in the first six months of this year. So we're kind of on both sides of that opportunity. And when the liquid markets open up, we see meaningful growth in capital velocity in our liquid business. And when they close, we take advantage of that and we try to capture share at the upper end of our market. But what you saw in the deployment from ARCC and I think it is showing up in the pipeline as well, the ability to pivot down market and capture excess return there is really, really unique. And I think that is a big driver of our ability to deploy in any market environment. And then lastly, and we talk about this a lot, is just incumbency. When you look at the size of the portfolios that we manage around the globe 40% to 60% of the dollars that we are putting out are into incumbent relationships. And so you saw that through 2023, in what was a slow M&A and new issue market we were still deploying at very healthy rates because of the value of that incumbency. So probably a long-winded answer, but I think the deployment continues to be broad based. We have a lot of flexibility to move around the market liquid to illiquid up and down balance sheet, sponsored and non-sponsored, and we'll continue to do that. Sure. Let us go a little bit deeper than just FRPR because I think it is important for people to understand how it rolls through the different components. But this, again is where the structure of our P&L and the structure of our balance sheet, I think is going to differentiate. And we talk a lot about the importance of balance sheet light versus balance sheet heavy, to smooth out the volatility that you see from sharp changes in valuation and rate moves. So if you were to look at the composition of the P&L first and foremost, we have obviously been a beneficiary of rates staying high on the Part 1 part of the P&L. There are public disclosures in the ARCC 10-Q that walk people through what the sensitivity is. But the good news is what you will see there is that there is a 100 basis point decline in rates just based on the structure of the compensation there. That would have roughly a $9 million impact on FRE. So cut that by four for your 25 basis point question which is sub 1%. But importantly, when rates come down, we typically see transaction volumes pick up. And that decline in Part 1 is typically offset by increased volumes and increased transaction fees. So our experience has been in that part of the P&L, that we have been net beneficiaries. When it comes to FRPR, it is also important to understand that there is a lag effect to your specific question. So typically, when we see rate decline just based on the structure of our investments, there's usually a six month lag effect. But if you were to look at 2024 positioning, if we saw a 25 basis point rate cut in 2024, that would probably have a $0.5 million impact on our FRPR. So again you could multiply that by whatever number you want. And then again, the future impact is going to be a function of what does it mean for earnings performance, valuations, et cetera. But the 2024 impact is de minimis. With regard to our disclosures on European waterfall, I think it is important that people understand that when we are making those calculations and giving you the guidance that we're giving, we're already using the forward yield curve in that guidance. So no surprises there. But in terms of how we expect that to roll through the portfolios, the expectation for cuts is already baked in. From a balance sheet standpoint, obviously balance sheet light, we don't expect any material impact. And in fact obviously given that we borrow under a pretty sizable floating rate revolver, we should see a net benefit from lower interest expense. And then maybe just to wrap all of that together, like I said we expect that the future decline in rates will spur increased capital markets and transaction activity and velocity of capital, which we think is a net -- a net add. And so I feel really good about the rate positioning, and to the extent that rate cuts start sooner than the market originally had underwritten based on today's jobs report, then so be it. Yes. I think that's a big part of it. Obviously the real estate business is one of the more rate-sensitive parts of the alternative landscape. And so getting rate stability, if not rate reduction, that does have a flow-through impact to transaction markets. And so I think some of the falling that you're beginning to see even ahead of the rate cuts is anticipation of rate reductions. The segments of the market that we focus on just to remind people, in order are industrial logistics and multi-family about 0% industrial, 25% multis for three-quarter of our book. And as we've been talking about all through this rate hiking cycle, the fundamentals at the property level in those markets have continued to be quite strong and the secular demand drivers are still intact. And so there is some fundamental strength that pushes through to transaction volume once you start to see the rates come down and that's part of it as well. The real estate debt business, I'd also say, has been a bright spot for us. Obviously, as we've seen in other parts of the private credit landscape, as the banks are derisking the private markets, have been able to come in and be a pretty reliable capital provider at some pretty attractive rates. And we have seen a meaningful opportunity developing in our US and European debt business as well where we are seeing some pretty healthy deployment. So the answer is we have dedicated teams and efforts underway here to make sure that our product is ready for that market when it opens. To your point, I think some of those logical channel partners are open and hoping to see the DC market open to privates and alternatives. You mentioned target date funds. I do think that will be one way that they find their way in. There are obviously going to be some call it, legal and regulatory headwinds to those markets opening up as quickly as maybe we all would like them to see. But when they do we will be ready, I guess is the best that I can say. But it is going to be a slow path, but one that we are cautiously optimistic will open up in due time. I'll try to give a simple answer to a \u2013 it is not actually a simple question because it goes back to some of my earlier comments just about the structure of the market. So in my oversimplified view of your lower middle market, traditional middle market and upper middle market I think it's safe to say that generally in the lower middle market in traditional middle market you have seen very little, if any of the large market structural deterioration find its way into those markets. When you start to get into the upper end of the middle market in competition, with both the liquid markets and the larger credit providers, you will see some but not nearly to the same extent as the traded markets, some deterioration in structure, which I would argue in many cases could be said to be appropriate because they are higher quality, sometimes larger borrowers that can command that type of structure. But most of the things that people should be concerned about in terms of the liability management loopholes and things that the media tends to focus on, those are really not present in the middle market. I think there is been an extraordinary amount of discipline despite the perception of increased competition on documents. Kipp and Kort again on the ARCC call addressed this as well in saying that, when you look at where we're turning transaction down, it is largely going to be over documents, and it could be some fairly simple or seemingly simple things that we will pass on if we don't feel that we have the ability to exercise our creditor rights when we need to -- the way that we need to. So I do think the media is probably overblowing it relative to the broad middle market. And even at the upper end in relation to the liquid market, it's really not that pervasive. I think PIK is a different question, and again, not to go down a PIK rabbit hole, PIK in today's market is not necessarily an indicator of structural deterioration. I\u2019d encourage people to think about it as a way for private credit managers to capture excess return at a time when base rates are high. And so if you are thinking about prudently structuring your leverage and managing to a sustainable interest coverage ratio and not constraining the cash flow of a company and constraining their ability to execute their business and growth plan, then PIK is the way that you are going to capture excess return and support your borrowers. So you have to differentiate between PIK that is intentional at the outset versus maybe PIK that is used to reduce default, et cetera, et cetera. But again, that is not really the same as some of the other structural deteriorations that people like to think about. And again, when you look at our approach to pick in the corporate credit book, it is more of the former than the latter. Yes. I think this is a place that we've been quite vocal. Craig brought it up earlier as we said that we were kind of tempering growth despite the high growth in places like ASIF. You have seen us raising equity and scaling ARCC. And now you are seeing in SDL III. We have learned over the 30 years that we've been doing this that it is critically important that you are diversified in your distribution and funding sources. We have a pretty good handle going into any year or years, as to what we think our deployment capacity is, and we structure our capital to meet that deployment capacity. So SDL has been investing already as we have raised, we're about $9 billion in the ground on that fund. So it is deploying at the expected pace. But we never want to be beholden to one fund or one channel because in different parts in the cycle, those will open or close. So if the non-traded market sees a slowdown in appetite, we want to make sure that we have other forms of capital that can actually meet the deployment demand. Similarly, as we get closer to end of fund life on some of our commingled, you may see us turn on managed accounts or the public entities. It's critically important that people understand that diversity of funding is a big driver of how we actually create value here, and we'll continue to do it. So I don't think we will ever give up on this complement of funds that we have open-ended, closed-ended, perpetual offer, campaign, traded, non-traded. It is a big part of how we run the business. Yes. I wouldn't say that it alters the opportunity set. I mean, Just to reiterate, I think what you are referring to, we've talked about the different phases. One was obviously an early phase where there is just certain portfolios that were distressed or certain balance sheets that were distressed that needed resolution either through asset sales or risk transfer transactions. And there is still some of that going on. But given the continued strength in the economy now, the prospect for rates, you may see less of that. There still is a pretty significant amount of assets sitting on bank balance sheets that will need to get resolved either for credit reasons or regulatory capital reasons. And so I don't think, that means that the types of deals that we\u2019re seeing are not going to happen. They just may not be happening at the same velocity. We are now I think transitioning to the next phase which we've talked about -- which is a much more sustained opportunity is that in the wake of that crisis and the wake of increased regulatory capital pressure. You will begin to see more of these assets finding their way into the private markets. And that is actually a more consistent opportunity set for places like our alternative credit business and our real estate lending business, to name a few. So I think that transition is underway. We are seeing it in the composition of our pipelines. But even with rates coming down, just given some of the acute stresses on certain bank balance sheets, I wouldn't rule out that you'll continue to see a decent amount of portfolio trades and continued risk transfer deals as well. Yes. We've talked about this so lot. I mean the best we can do -- we don't have a crystal ball, but we have data that we see in our private market portfolios that is telling us something different. And we've been consistent on that. So two years ago, when the markets were calling for a recession, we weren't. And so we try not to get worked up as long-term investors in any one singular headline. We obviously already talked about that if rate cuts get pulled forward both in terms of timing and magnitude I think the business is very well-positioned for that transition. But we are not seeing anything in our private portfolios that would argue for what we are seeing in the market today. It is interesting because as a private market practitioner that runs a public company, I'm often struck at just the volatility and schizophrenia that you can see in the interpretation of data that comes out in the public markets. And month to month, good news, is bad news and bad news, is good news. And today I guess, okay news is bad news. We just try to look at the facts as we see them and make sure that we are well positioned. But I personally feel -- I feel like it is an overreaction, but we'll keep collecting data and react accordingly. Sure. As I said, we have right now about eight industry teams that we deploy across the private credit business. They are originating direct to corporate and they are supporting our sponsor-led originators and deal teams when a sponsor is actually investing in a company in that industry. So it's kind of a double benefit of that we are actually able to increase our non-sponsored origination. But also, I think do a better job underwriting in some of these markets. The non-sponsored business, just given the size of the markets and the importance of sponsor, will continue to grow on an aggregate dollar basis. But I'm not sure that we'll get it to a place where it's kind of going to overwhelm the sponsor backed opportunity. But order of magnitude, just to give you a sense, if you were to look at our non-sponsored origination just in our direct lending business, and there's a pull-through effect to other parts of the business, it's probably somewhere between 5% and 10%. So it's meaningful aggregate dollars, but it's not going to move the needle in any given period. It's highly differentiated, particularly in some of these core verticals like sports media and entertainment or life sciences where we've been early both in adding people and capital. So we'll keep making those investments. Yes. So the way I think people need to begin to understand the deployment is the deployment geography will change right? So if you go back and you look at 2023 where new transaction volume was constrained, you would have seen increased deal activity within the incumbent portfolios and in places like opportunistic credit, alternative credit and secondaries because they are going to be that liquidity provider into the dislocated market. Then you transition to a healthy market and you'll see volumes ramp up in the liquid side of the business and new issue volumes increasing in the direct lending market. And if we go into a more volatile market and banks pull back, et cetera, then you'll shift it again. So because of the diversity of strategies that we manage and the diversity of geographies that we manage them in, the volatility of deployment is reducing over time. And so yes, I continue to believe that just based on the weight of capital, the aging of the installed base of private equity, rate cuts having a corollary impact on valuations and the cost of capital I still think that we are going to see pretty healthy deployment into the back half of the year, today's market move notwithstanding. But if for whatever reason, the market has got too nervous then we are going to find other parts where our capital is going to be more relevant and we would kind of be deploying there as well. So I think we are in a really good spot. Well, as of now, that's just a headline. I don't know if anybody really knows what that deal actually looks like. So I can't opine as to whether or not we would do something like that or not. We have partnered with more traditional asset management platforms over the years through various sub-advisory agreements and partnerships to bring private markets into some of those portfolios, and that's been a part of our diversification of distribution historically. So I would expect that type of thing would continue. We would be open to it. I think I would just go back to some of our comments around our Investor Day, is that we are very focused on what I would call high quality growth. And what I mean by that is sustainable growth at high fee rate, high margin where we are maximizing the value of our origination. Because at the end of the day the binding constraint to growth and profitability for anybody in our business is going to be our ability to source unique assets. And how we then deliver those assets to our clients whether they are institutional or retail, is another side of the equation. But from the Ares Management shareholder perspective our goal is to make sure that we maximize the profitability of that origination. And so I don't -- again not knowing what those partnerships look like, it\u2019s very expensive to originate and portfolio-manage the type of assets that we do. They do require a high fee rate which is why our average fee rate is 1.1%. And so we have to be very careful that when we start talking about private markets within traditional portfolios that people don't go down the rabbit hole of thinking they can access difficult to access non-correlated unique private outcomes at public market rates. So we think a lot about it. We have very deep relationships with many of the traditional managers at the highest levels of the firms. But the calculus as to whether or not to enter into any partnership like that is going to really go back to what I said earlier, is what's our capacity to deploy and is there a benefit in diversifying the distribution into that channel against that deployment. And so I think that's a TBD. Great. We appreciate it. Thank you for the great questions and the time today. And we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Enjoy the rest of the summer."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Ares Management Corporation's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, May 2, 2024.\n I would now like to turn the call over to Greg Mason, Co-Head of Public Markets Investor Relations for Ares Management. Please go ahead, sir. \nGreg Mason: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for our first quarter conference call. I'm joined today by Michael Arougheti, our Chief Executive Officer; and Jarrod Phillips, our Chief Financial Officer. We also have a number of executives with us today who will be available during the Q&A session.\n Before we begin, I want to remind you that comments made during this call contain forward-looking statements and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those identified in our risk factors in our SEC filings. Our actual results could differ materially, and we undertake no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Please also note that past performance is not a guarantee of future results, and nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Ares fund.\n During this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Please refer to our first quarter earnings presentation available on the Investor Resources section of our website for reconciliations of the measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n Note that we plan to file our Form 10-Q later this month. This morning, we announced that we declared our second quarter common dividend of $0.93 per share on the company's Class A and nonvoting common stock, representing an increase of 21% over our dividend for the same quarter a year ago. The dividend will be paid on June 28, 2024, to holders of record on June 14.\n Now I'll turn the call over to Michael Arougheti, who will start with some quarterly financial and business highlights. \nMichael Arougheti: Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. We hope everybody is doing well. We generated strong first quarter results with double-digit year-over-year growth across our key financial metrics, including 19% growth in AUM, 18% growth in fee-related earnings, over $17 billion in gross capital raised, a 21% increase in our deployment from drawdown funds and strong investment performance across our investment strategies.\n Our AUM increased to $428 billion, which is well ahead of the growth trajectory that we outlined for our year-end 2025 goal of $500 billion and our available capital and AUM not yet paying fees, both reached new records up more than 27% year-over-year.\n In our opinion, we're very well positioned for strong future growth as the transaction environment improves. As we had expected, our first quarter realizations were seasonally light, leading our realized income to be comprised entirely of higher quality, more stable fee-related earnings. Yet, our future performance income potential continues to build as our incentive-generating AUM increased by 26% year-over-year, and our net accrued performance income balance increased by more than $55 million year-over-year despite realizing $136 million in net performance income over the past 12 months.\n As we stated previously, we expect most of the realizations from our European-style funds this year to occur in the second and fourth quarters, with the largest quarterly amount anticipated in the fourth quarter. The economy is proving to be remarkably resilient in the face of higher interest rates and companies in our portfolios are, on the whole, consistently generating strong cash flow and earnings growth.\n Aggregate default levels in our credit portfolios continue to be well below historical levels, while key fundamental credit indicators remain healthy. In the first quarter and continuing into Q2, we are seeing a significant number of upsizing opportunities with our existing borrowers. With over 800 corporate borrowers in our global direct lending portfolio, the benefits of incumbency enable us to efficiently retain and invest more capital to support the growth of our portfolio companies.\n In real estate, operating fundamentals continue to be sound in our highest allocated sectors, particularly within industrial, multifamily and our adjacent sectors like student housing and single-family rental. The strength that we're witnessing is not exclusive to the U.S. European markets are experiencing a moderate rebound in activity across the continent and the economies of the Asia Pacific region are showing signs of growth.\n While we continue to invest in strategic growth initiatives across our firm, such as secondaries, infrastructure and insurance, we believe that we have built one of the top global platforms in private credit, which is one of the fastest-growing sectors and alternatives. We now have over $280 billion in AUM, in what we define as private credit, and it spans direct lending in the U.S., Europe and Asia as well as asset-based credit, opportunistic credit, real estate debt and infrastructure debt.\n We believe that we are early in the transformation of many of these large and fragmented addressable markets, particularly within asset-based credit, opportunistic credit, global infrastructure debt, European real estate debt and Asia private credit.\n For years, we've been investing in the future growth in these areas. And today, we believe that we have leading platforms in many of these segments. For example, our alternative credit team, which now has approximately 70 investment professionals and $36.5 billion in AUM manages what we believe is one of the largest pools of noninsurance capital focused on non-rated asset-based credit. As an example, this flexible capital makes our team an ideal partner for the banking sector's long-term transition away from noncore assets.\n Similarly, we believe that we've been making the necessary investments to benefit from the significant demand for private infrastructure capital solutions over the next several decades, as global players modernize digital infrastructure and transition to sources of clean energy.\n Infrastructure debt is a multitrillion dollar market that has historically been primarily financed by banks and other traditional providers, where we're seeing a growing need for private capital solutions. Our team, which we believe is one of the leading providers of private infrastructure credit, is well positioned for these trends.\n We continue to see strong fundraising momentum across our platform as both institutional and retail investors remain meaningfully under allocated to alternative investments. We believe that we're continuing to capture an increasing percentage of our investors' capital as existing investors are re-upping into new funds and investing across our strategies at a high rate.\n Our fundraising success has come in different rate cycles and economic environments over the past decades, which supports our view that assets follow performance. We believe that we also set ourselves apart with our differentiated deployment capability and market insights as well as a high-quality investor service.\n During the first quarter, we were active with our various private credit strategies and our 2 largest commingled funds in the market have now each exceeded the sizes of their previous vintages. Our third U.S. senior direct lending fund raised an additional $2.8 billion in the first quarter and subsequent to quarter end, raised another $500 million in equity commitments. The fund now has $9.7 billion in equity commitments and over $17 billion in potential investment capacity at quarter end with current and anticipated future leverage. This compares to the previous vintages $8 billion in equity commitments and approximately $14 billion in total investment capacity. We anticipate the fund's final close will occur sometime this summer.\n Our 6 European direct lending fund raised an additional EUR 1 billion in equity commitments in the first quarter, bringing total equity commitments to EUR 11.5 billion, exceeding the previous vintage of EUR 11 billion. The fund has over EUR 17 billion of potential investment capacity at quarter end with current and anticipated future leverage. We're continuing to raise additional capital, and we anticipate a final close towards year-end. Both of these funds are already investing with over 1/3 of the respective current equity commitments deployed for each fund.\n Alternative credit had another strong fundraising quarter despite the absence of a significant campaign fund in the market. We raised $1.5 billion in 3 separate SMAs for large third-party insurance clients in our rated strategies, of which one has already added an incremental $250 million upsize following quarter end.\n Our open-end core alternative credit fund, which accepts new subscriptions up to twice a year, raised nearly $330 million during the quarter. Since its inception less than 3 years ago, this fund has grown to more than $5 billion in AUM.\n In the first quarter, with the CLO markets recovering, we raised $1.7 billion in liquid credit mandates, including 2 CLOs. We also priced 3 additional CLOs in April and through the first 4 months of the year have already exceeded the amount of capital that we raised in CLOs for all of 2023.\n Our wealth solutions platform is beginning to reach an inflection point, where several of our perpetual funds are experiencing accelerating inflows from our efforts to expand our distribution, both domestically and internationally. In fact, our first quarter equity inflows in the wealth channel, which totaled $2 billion, were more than 50% higher than our fourth quarter last year. 30% of the inflows this quarter came from outside the U.S., and we're seeing a material increase in interest from Europe and Asia.\n Our quarter's strong equity inflows were driven by our nontraded BDC, ASIF, which raised nearly $600 million and our direct lending fund in Europe, ASIF, which raised nearly $500 million in its inaugural quarter.\n Our private equity secondaries fund, APMF, is also gaining significant momentum nearing $1 billion in AUM and our diversified credit fund, CABC, surpassed $5 billion in AUM and is seeing a ramp in new international flows. So including leverage in our credit vehicles, we raised nearly $3.2 billion in total AUM in the wealth channel for the quarter. This momentum continued into April with another $800 million in equity inflows.\n Across our 6 nontraded wealth management products, we've reached approximately $25 billion in AUM, nearly 4x the amount that we had following the launch of our Ares Wealth Management Solutions platform less than 3 years ago. Looking ahead, we're excited about further growth in the wealth management channel as our broadening product suite is enabling us to further penetrate within our existing distribution and to attract a growing number of new distribution partners.\n Finally, Aspida continues to experience strong quarterly growth with assets under management increasing by an additional $1.5 billion, reaching $14 billion in total AUM. We continue to pursue an asset-light balance sheet approach to our affiliated insurance platform and are seeing increased third-party interest in funding Aspida. We believe the third-party capital we raised in the first quarter and expect to raise in the coming months will provide us with sufficient runway for Aspida to maintain its strong growth trajectory for the foreseeable future.\n On the Ares balance sheet at quarter end, we had less than $900 million directly invested in either credit assets or in our affiliated insurance vehicle. This represents approximately 0.2% of our total AUM and stands in stark contrast to the amount of on-balance sheet credit assets held by banks and insurance firms across the country. Our entire investment portfolio represents less than 0.5% of our total AUM, which highlights our commitment to an asset-light approach across our businesses.\n Overall, we expect over 35 different funds in the market this year across our investment strategies, including the 2 private credit funds we discussed, our third special opportunities fund, our sixth infrastructure debt fund, our seventh corporate private equity fund, our fourth European value-add real estate fund, our 11th U.S. value-add fund, our second climate infrastructure fund and secondaries funds in infrastructure and credit, to name several.\n As the traditional credit markets have increasingly become more active, this is drawing out more investment activity across the U.S. markets. CLO formation is robust and banks are becoming more competitive in the syndicated loan market driving increasing transaction volumes. Of note, a significant portion of the transaction activity to date has been refinancing related with less coming from new M&A. Although activity levels in our European and Asia Pacific markets are comparatively slower, we expect to see some pickup in transactions in those regions.\n In the quarter, our gross deployment activity increased to $18.6 billion, a 52% increase over the first quarter of last year, including nearly $15 billion in private credit. Since refinancing activity also increased, our net deployment was a little more muted, which slowed our growth in fee-paying AUM. However, we continue to have conviction that the pent-up demand for M&A, the significant amount of private equity dry powder and the demand from LPs to return capital will be conducive to an improved transaction environment this year.\n Across U.S. and European Direct Lending, we deployed more than $11 billion in the quarter, which is more than double our deployment from a year ago period, as we gained significant market share in a relatively slower market environment. We were active with both incumbent borrowers and new companies, finding opportunities to invest in more traditional middle market companies as well as larger businesses that opted for a direct lending solution.\n Alternative credit experienced robust deployment in the quarter with nearly $2.9 billion invested across various asset-based submarkets. Notable transactions include forming an equipment leasing platform, Ansley Park, acquiring a portfolio of newly originated consumer loans from upstart and investing in digital infrastructure in partnership with the infrastructure equity team. Additionally, the team remained active in fund finance, particularly in NAV lending and structured GP solutions. Subsequent to quarter end, we announced a joint venture within the non-QM residential space. supporting over $2.5 billion in new originations.\n In real estate, transaction activity is improving and our pipeline is growing, driven by our substantial dry powder, more economic certainty and compelling market values. We're seeing low double-digit return opportunities in senior debt, mid-teens return opportunities and funding the gaps within capital structures and intriguing equity opportunities, primarily in our core sectors of industrial, multifamily and student housing. And within secondaries, transaction volumes are expanding with GP-led transactions continuing to outpace LP-led opportunities. We anticipate LP-led opportunities to gain further momentum as portfolios reprice and liquidity needs increase. As an example, in April, we completed the largest LP-led private equity secondaries transaction in our firm's history.\n And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jarrod for more detailed comments on our quarterly financial highlights and outlook. Jarrod? \nJarrod Phillips: Thanks, Mike. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We continue to deliver strong results in the first quarter with mid- to high-teens growth in AUM, management fees, fee-related earnings and realized income along with stronger growth of 28% in our AUM not yet paying fees, which we view as a leading indicator of our capacity for future growth.\n With the current geopolitical risks, sustained inflationary data and high interest rates, our high-quality FRE-based earnings stream provides strong visibility because it's less dependent on the uncertainty arising from the timing of realization activity. As Mike stated, we're off to a solid start in fundraising, raising over $17 billion in the first quarter, and our available capital has reached a new high, positioning us well for future growth and taking advantage of a return to higher levels of M&A activity.\n Starting with revenues. Our management fees totaled over $693 million in the quarter, an increase of 15% compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by the deployment of our available capital. As expected, fee-related performance revenues were also modest in the quarter as the vast majority of FRPR is crystallized in the fourth quarter.\n In our credit segment, our credit FRPR should benefit from the higher for longer interest rate environment, assuming no significant changes to spreads or asset valuations. FRE totaled $302 million, up 18% from the first quarter of 2023, driven by higher management fees and a margin improvement of roughly 150 basis points to 42.1%. We expect continued FRE growth during the rest of 2024 as deployment activity gains momentum throughout the year.\n As Mike mentioned, seasonality, continued rate uncertainty and bid-ask spread differentials on values constrained our realization activity in the first quarter. As a result, we generated $10 million of realized net performance income in the first quarter, up from $7 million a year ago. As we've mentioned on previous earnings calls, our European waterfall realizations are currently more seasonal in nature and meaningfully concentrated in the fourth and second quarters.\n The current seasonality of our European-style waterfall realizations is primarily due to the early stage of our larger eligible credit funds that make distributions to investors to cover tax payments compared to older, smaller European-style funds that are at the end of their life cycles. This seasonality will persist until several of our larger European funds start regularly realizing performance income toward the end of their fund lives.\n For 2024 and 2025, it's best to assume 60% in the fourth quarter, 30% in the second quarter and 10% spread across the other quarters. For the full years 2024 and 2025, we continue to believe that the net realized performance income from European-style waterfall funds will generate $420 million in 2024 and 2025 with over 2/3 of that amount realized in 2025.\n Realized income in the first quarter was $289 million, a 14% increase over the previous year. Importantly, our realized income was entirely comprised of our fee-related earnings due to our limited realized performance income for the quarter. After-tax realized income per share of Class A common stock was $0.80, up 13% from the first quarter of 2023. As of March 31, our AUM stood at $428 billion, up from $360 billion in the previous year, representing a 19% increase. Our fee-paying AUM reached $267 billion at the end of the quarter, up 14% from the previous year.\n Strong deployment across our U.S. and European direct lending, alternative credit and opportunistic credit strategies, all of which pay management fees on invested capital, primarily drove our year-over-year growth in fee-paying AUM.\n Following sustained fundraising momentum, we're building our shadow AUM, setting the stage for higher deployment and future management fee growth. Our AUM not yet paying fees available for future deployment totaled nearly $65 billion at quarter end, representing over $621 million in potential future management fees.\n Our incentive eligible AUM increased by 17% in the first quarter of 2024 to $247 billion. Of this amount, $82 billion is uninvested, representing significant performance fee earning potential. In the first quarter, our net accrued performance income increased to $938 million as we continued to compound interest income above the hurdle rates in our credit strategies. Of the $938 million of net accrued performance income at quarter end, $772 million or just over 80% was in European-style waterfall funds, with $506 million coming from funds that are out of their reinvestment period.\n Finally, in terms of fund performance, we believe our fundraising success is driven by our consistent investment performance throughout market cycles. Our first quarter's performance continues to reinforce that view. Across our credit group, we had another excellent quarter with gross composite returns ranging from approximately 3% to 7% for the quarter, and gross composite returns ranging from 10% to nearly 40% over the last 12 months across our 6 primary credit strategies.\n Across real assets, we generated gross returns and infrastructure debt at approximately 3% for the quarter and 7% for the last 12 months. And in U.S. real estate equity, the quarter composite returns turned positive.\n As Mike stated, we continue to see positive fundamentals in our real estate portfolios, and we're beginning to see signs of a market recovery. Our private equity composite was flat in the quarter but has returned approximately 7% over the last 12 months. Our portfolio fundamentals are sound with low teens year-over-year EBITDA growth. And our latest corporate private equity fund, ACOF VI has generated a 24% gross IRR since inception. Overall, we remain on track for our 20% growth objectives for fee-related earnings and dividends per common share for the year, and we look forward to providing new long-term guidance at our Investor Day on May 21.\n I'll send it back to Mike for closing comments. \nMichael Arougheti: Great. Thanks, Jarrod. We believe our first quarter highlights not only our significant momentum, but also the future growth potential across our business lines. Over the past several years, we've made investments in building out new investment platforms and distribution in significant new growth segments that are now coming online and contributing to our growth profile. These areas include alternative credit, infrastructure, real estate debt, APAC credit, secondaries, wealth management and insurance. We hope to capitalize on these segments secular drivers in the years ahead.\n We've also continued to heavily invest in our more scaled investing strategies, which positions us to outperform when markets get more competitive. As you can see from our first quarter's results, our fundraising momentum remains robust, and we're positioned for growth with a record amount of dry powder and 28% growth in our AUM not yet paying fees. We believe our asset-light business model provides consistent and substantial earnings growth, while limiting our exposure to the volatility of the financial markets.\n And as Jarrod stated, we have great visibility into the future earnings streams from our European waterfall style funds in the years to come. We look forward to providing a deep dive into our business and discussing our promising long-term outlook with you at our Investor Day in a few weeks. And as always, I'm grateful for our team's hard work and dedication, and I appreciate our investors' ongoing support of our company.\n And operator, with that, I think we can now open up the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler, Bank of America. \nCraig Siegenthaler: So we wanted your perspective on the current deployment backdrop in direct lending and how the demand supply dynamics are evolving. So first on the demand side, what are you seeing from other asset managers, bank syndications? And how is this translating into spread? \nMichael Arougheti: Sure. So if you look at the ARCC performance and obviously, look at what we're doing elsewhere in our private credit businesses, I think you're going to see high quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year gross deployment. I do think that we continue to not just hold market share, but gain share, and I'll come back to that in a second. And right now, given that transaction activity has been muted, you could see it in the syndicated loan and high-yield market too, that the transaction activity is skewing more towards refis than new issue activity.\n We've been able to defend the portfolio from that and grow, which I think is very differentiated just given our portfolio size and incumbency. And so I do think both on a gross and net deployment basis, we're outperforming. I would say that spreads have tightened and until we see new activity accelerate, you could expect they may tighten a little bit more from here. They've been stabilized over the last couple of weeks, the pipeline would indicate that they get hold here. But I feel really good about the fundraising and the supply of capital versus the demand, particularly for us.\n One other differentiator, I think, too, is, some of the peer set, I think, are overly relying on the wealth channel for the growth in their private credit capital. And that's, frankly, just a much harder part of equation to manage in terms of the flows versus the deployment, particularly when you get into market back up like this. So I do feel one of the ways that we've been able to outperform in this context is the diversity of the funds that we have in terms of drawdown and nontraded just gives us a little bit of a capital advantage through cycles. \nCraig Siegenthaler: Mike, just a follow-up on the new issue side, what is the outlook from private equity sponsors and also independent private companies, which I know is part of the business. Some of your peers are looking for a pickup in private equity transactions. So that could certainly help on the sponsor side. \nMichael Arougheti: Yes, I think we would -- we're looking for a pickup as well. One of the benefits of being in the private market is you see that pipeline developing before the M&A numbers become public. We talked about this in our year-end call. We are seeing the ingredients for a pickup in M&A activity, both within the sponsored and nonsponsored part of the world. That's a combination of stabilized rates, putting aside whether rates will go down to stabilized rates, by definition should spur transaction activity in the private equity part of the market. Obviously, there is a pretty significant demand from the LP community to see a return of capital, and that should accelerate transaction activity as well.\n One flip side to the technicals and the loan and high-yield market right now is as that machine turns on, it, by definition, spurs transaction activity. And I would also think that, that would be an accelerant. So everything we're seeing would indicate that deal flow will pick up as we move through the year. Obviously, if you look at the advisory community and you talk to the sell side, I think they'll tell you that the shadow pipeline is picking up as well. And we're also optimistic and we're seeing this too in the real estate side of the business, that transaction activity is beginning to unfreeze there as well. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. \nAlexander Blostein: I wanted to start maybe with some opportunities you talked about with respect to third-party insurance space and the momentum you've seen through sort of building up there. Can you maybe help us kind of frame what that business looks like for Ares today in terms of either fee-paying AUM or however you want to frame that? And maybe talk a little bit about the fee rates and the fee structures in that business. So is it just straight up management fee? Or does that include fee-related performance revenue attached to that? Just was hoping to get a little more granularity there. \nMichael Arougheti: Sure. So maybe just zooming out, obviously, the insurance opportunity is an important one for someone like us, obviously, with a market-leading position in private credit. We have chosen to build our insurance solutions practice here to support a pretty large and significant amount of third-party insurance clients as well as our own affiliated insurance business, both of which continue to be fast growing.\n With regard to our affiliated insurance platform, Aspida, if you go back to our Investor Day in the summer of 2021, we laid out an expectation that, that business would approach $25 billion AUM by the end of 2025 on $500 million of guidance. We are on track for that, if not pacing ahead of that. And you could see that in the numbers. We continue to raise third-party capital to grow that business. AUM is up to $14 billion and a very healthy combination of organic annuities distribution and reinsurance relationships would have us growing quite nicely there. The fundraising momentum for the affiliated insurance company is very strong right now. And as we talked about in the prepared remarks, our expectation is as we make our way through the second quarter that the equity that we'll raise there would be ample to meet or exceed the growth objectives of that business.\n In terms of the fees there, the structure is probably what you're used to seeing. We do get an administrative fee on the entirety of the affiliated balance sheet for the services that we provide on capital markets, investment advisory, actuarial, et cetera, and then arm's length fees on the sub-advised strategies as well. Those fees -- the sub-advise fees in terms of our financial presentation are showing up in the underlying business lines, not in the Insurance Solutions P&L. So when you go to the segment reporting, a lot of the financial benefit of that is showing up in our alternative credit business and our secondaries business. But we have been pretty vocal that our goal is to continue to pursue an asset-light approach to this opportunity that we will continue to grow and nurture our third-party insurance clients, which now represent over $50 billion with close to 150 separate insurance relationships. And so I think you'll continue to see the third-party business grow alongside the rapid growth of the affiliate. \nAlexander Blostein: Got you. Okay. And then my second question is around kind of things outside of credit, and you guys have demonstrated tremendous amount of success in credit over the years and the outlook, obviously continues to be pretty strong there. But can you spend maybe a minute on what are the biggest sort of sources of management fee growth you expect in other parts of the business? So whether it's real estate, private equity secondaries, just maybe spend a couple of minutes on the growth outlook there. \nMichael Arougheti: Sure. Look, I think the good news is, and we've said this before, while the market, I think, has come to appreciate the leadership position that we stake out in credit, they may underappreciate the leadership position that we've staked out in other parts of our business. If you were to look at our real assets platform, our real estate business continues to grow and diversify, both in the U.S. and in Europe. And I would expect continued management fee growth across that platform.\n If you look at our infrastructure business, obviously, we have a meaningful climate infrastructure and energy transaction -- transition practice that's growing. We are one of the market leaders on the infrastructure debt space. We believe that, that is a significant global addressable market that is meaningfully undercapitalized, and we'd expect, as we continue to lean into the fundraise for our sixth infrastructure debt fund that will be able to drive pretty meaningful management fee growth there.\n We talked about insurance, that's going to be a meaningful growth engine for us. So most, if not all, of the businesses across the platform are growing at trend. Some will grow faster given the secular backdrop. But I think the diversity of the strategies you'll see are continuing to mature and a lot of the competitive advantages that we've created in credit around scale and origination and information are now starting to show up in real assets and secondaries and PE, et cetera. So I -- without going into every line of business, I think you should come to expect with some episodic growth. But if you smooth it that you're going to see trend growth from almost every business here. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. \nSteven Chubak: So wanted to start out with a question just on opportunistic credit. Recognized that it's only about 5% of aggregate credit AUM. But just given a high number of levered corporates grappling with  growing interest burden, nearly deteriorating cash flow positions, how do you see the opportunity and opportunistic credit unfolding, especially in a prolonged hire for longer ride backdrop? \nMichael Arougheti: Sure. Thank you for asking that question because Alex asked for noncredit growth areas. And so you just teed up, I think, one of the most exciting areas within credit, which is what we would broadly call opportunistic credit, obviously, alternative credit as well. And you hit the nail on the head. In a higher for longer rate environment where asset values have if not come down are difficult to transact on and debt service becomes tight.\n The nature of conversations that we are having with institutional owners of real assets and companies is largely the same, which is I have a high-performing asset that I paid a full price for and a different discount rate and interest rate environment. I need to own it longer in order to realize on my investment thesis, while I'm performing a disproportionate amount of my EBITDA and cash flow and NOI is going to debt service and I need a way to create a runway to execute on my business plan, and that's where most of the businesses here are turning on. And so we're calling on private equity sponsors and institutional real asset owners with a full complement of liquidity solutions, ranging from an opportunistic credit solution that could be structured debt and equity to deleverage and reduce cash burden. We're calling on them with plain vanilla refis. We're calling on them with secondary solutions at the portfolio company level. We're calling on them with NAV loans and fund finance solutions. But most of the origination here is trained on that singular issue, which is high-quality assets with \"bad balance sheets\" that need some form of resolution. And I think opportunistic credit is going to be a big beneficiary of that.\n The issue is particularly acute in private equity because if you look at private equity today in terms of the purchase price multiple environment leading up to the run-up in rates, we were close to two standard deviations higher than historical average on private equity purchase price going into the rate hiking cycle. And so even for the highest quality business, you could argue that there's probably a 30% gap in the capital structure that needs to get filled today with some kind of solution.\n I mentioned the difficulty from a DPI standpoint that the PE market, in particular, is experiencing and the need to get capital back to LPs is very, very acute. And PE now, it's interesting, there's about 3.5x the amount of dollars in the ground in the private equity market than there are sitting undeployed in dry powder. And if you go back to prior cycles, that's typically been at equilibrium where you had $1 in the ground versus $1 uninvested. So in a world where $3.5 trillion is sitting invested in these capital structures and $1 trillion is available for either reinvestment into the existing portfolio or to do new deals, there needs to be some very precise decisions being made by the owners of these companies as to how to use that dry powder. And so opportunistic credit is a very logical way to bring capital and that's not dilutive to the equity, but addresses whatever liquidity challenge may exist and gives the company runway. So we're very optimistic for that part of the market and part of our fundraising strategy for this year is to bring the next vintage fund in that strategy to market this year as well. \nSteven Chubak: And for my follow-up, just on the gross versus origination dynamic that you were discussing earlier, can certainly appreciate the areas of differentiation, some of the sources of relative outperformance you cited for Ares. But just given expectations for continued strong gross origination activity, how do you see the gross versus net origination ratio trajecting over the next few quarters, whether there's any sort of historical period or paradigm that we could anchor to where a sponsor M&A was active in building the syndicated markets were also wide open? \nAlexander Blostein: Yes. I mean if you go back and look at the history of our deployment, you'll be able to get a really good look for that. And I think we are in an anomalous quarter where the gross to net is probably tighter than it has been historically. To put it in perspective, if you were to look at our gross deployment of $18.6 billion, roughly $14 billion or so of it was in our private credit businesses. And then we had obviously strong gross deployment in the U.S., strong gross deployment in all credit and strong gross deployment in European credit. Interestingly in European credit, and this is a little episodic, we had two very large positions that came out of the book, one of which then got refinanced into the book in Q2. And we basically, on that gross deployment of $13.6 billion in private credit, had net deployment about $3.5 billion. That is a very high gross to net adjustment.\n I would say historically, and we can follow up with the exact if I were to think about private credit generally over multiple decades and cycles, we've typically experienced a 25% gross to net, meaning 75% of the gross typically finds its way into net deployment. And so I think as you start to see transaction activity pick up, we would expect to see the gross to net improve from what we saw in Q1. It's still early, but we did talk about on the ARCC earnings call, the backlog and pipeline building through April. And even though it's only one month, you will begin to see that the backlog and pipeline there gross to net is already improving in April, and we hope it would continue through the quarter. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Budish, Barclays. \nBenjamin Budish: I apologize I had the mute hit. I wanted to ask about some of the management fee trends we saw, especially outside the credit business, private equity, real assets, secondaries, it looks there was some movement from Q4. Just curious if there's anything to highlight there or anything we should be keeping in mind? \nMichael Arougheti: No, I don't think so. I mean -- go ahead, Jarrod. \nJarrod Phillips: You got that Mike, either way. Yes, there's nothing really that we talked about it in the fourth quarter. We did have some catch-up fees in both secondaries and real assets. That was about $14.5 million in those two different segments. So what you saw is the effect of those catch-up fees now just being part of our annual run rate. And there and in private equity, it's just regular way of occasionally, there's pay downs within the portfolio and then your fees go down a little bit when you have some aged funds in there. So there's nothing really kind of noteworthy. We still saw -- if you adjust for those catch-up fees, you still saw management fees grow quarter-over-quarter. \nBenjamin Budish: Makes enough sense. \nMichael Arougheti: I was just going to add one thing, Ben, if I may because I didn't know if you're asking about the management fee line item or fee rates. I think it's important. If you look historically, we've been maintaining a fee rate between 100 and 110 basis points pretty consistently. If you were to go strategy by strategy, you'll actually see that the management fee rate quarter-over-quarter has been flat and in certain strategies is slightly up. So putting aside the quarter-over-quarter narrative that Jarrod highlighted, I think it's important in a given quarter, you may see a slight mix shift that will show a little bit of variability in the management fee, but the headline fee rates are holding. \nBenjamin Budish: Got it. I was asking about the fee rate, so that's helpful. I appreciate that, Mike. And maybe for my follow-up, just on the wealth side, it sounds like you're seeing some good momentum. Can you just kind of give us an update in terms of your distribution expansion in terms of product parity, how much of the future growth comes from more wires versus penetrating existing partners more deeply, things like that? \nMichael Arougheti: Yes, we -- I can't really give you a linear view on where the drivers of growth are going to come from. And maybe just to give people a sense for what our wealth management business looks like today, we have about 150 wealth professionals that are singularly focused on distributing and servicing our family of wealth product. We continue to build out the number of products on our platform as well as the number of distribution partners that we have. Today, we have 2 non-traded REITs, a private equity fund, a nontraded BDC, a European credit fund, a credit interval fund, and we are in the process of introducing new funds into the market as well.\n The existing fund family, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, raised about $3.2 billion in the first quarter. That was up from $2 billion in Q4 and $900 million a year ago. So roughly 2.5 plus times growth year-over-year and 50% growth quarter-over-quarter. And April, on the equity side alone, we raised $800 million. So if you assume roughly the same 1:1 leverage, that would be roughly a levered amount. So there's a lot of growth that we're experiencing, and it's a combination of increasing distribution partnerships, building out the fund platform. And I think a real bright spot for us has been the very rapid results that we're seeing in our international distribution. We highlighted AESIF, which is our European credit fund, and they had a very strong inaugural quarter, and we continue to see a lot of international demand for that as well. So we have a road map, obviously, to continue to add distribution partners and new products. And so I think these numbers will both diversify and grow. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Worthington, JPMorgan. \nKenneth Worthington: You highlighted the strength of fundraising this quarter, particularly in credit. Preqin came out recently with private market fundraising data which indicated that fundraise and private credit hit a peak in 2Q last year and has been sort of falling ever since with 1Q '24 levels, the lowest since 2020. And is the backdrop for private credit fundraising changing at all? And if so, what may be contributing to this sort of industry slowdown. And again, you highlighted how strong yours is, is the dialogue you're having with your LPs changing at all in any way sort of reflecting more modest enthusiasm? \nMichael Arougheti: That has not been our experience. We have talked for quite some time with all of you just about the opportunity that we see given our leadership position and scale. And one of the things that we have talked about is that as these markets consolidate, the larger LPs are doing more business with fewer scale managers that can need a broad base of needs. And so private credit, and there's some pretty good data putting aside the frequent report from private debt and other publications that just show the concentration of fundraising and deployment in the hands of the largest managers with us near or at the top of the list. So I think, thankfully, we're not having that experience. We talked about the very positive experience we've seen in our third senior loan fund, which has already exceeded the prior vintage, our 6 European fund, which has already exceeded the prior vintage. We're seeing good momentum in our real estate credit fund. As I mentioned, obviously, we are working through our sixth infrastructure private credit fund. And if the BDC and interval funds that we have in the wealth channel or any indication, I think our brand continues to resonate there. So that has not been our experience, but we're watching the industry data as well.\n If you could attribute it to one thing and frequent hint of this, I do think given the rate environment, you are beginning to see dispersion of performance. And I think that there are many people who think that being great in direct lending is maybe easier than it really is. And you're beginning to see certain managers underperforming, and there could be a little bit of a cautionary moment here where people want to see the credit performance work through their portfolios with certain managers. But no, we're seeing continued demand, and we would expect that to continue. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. \nMichael Cyprys: I was hoping to drill down a bit on the infrastructure and real estate debt side. It seems like a significant opportunity for you that you've alluded to in the prepared remarks. I was hoping maybe you could elaborate on that, particularly with AI driving demand for data centers and power generation that will need finance. I'm just curious how you see that opportunity evolving for Ares to meaningfully participate there as well as the steps that you're taking to enhance the origination and sourcing funnel. I'm just curious how you see -- how you're looking to build that out? \nMichael Arougheti: Sure. Thanks, Mike. So maybe we'll handle them separately because they're both benefiting from different opportunities and different trends covering maybe infrastructure debt first. There are two things I would highlight. One of them you pointed to, which is just the significant amount of capital that is needed to hasten the transition in digital infrastructure to support the hyperscale data center rollout. That is roughly by our estimation, a $5 trillion capital opportunity and the market is woefully undercapitalized to take advantage of it. We are one of the leading debt providers in that market and continue to add people and capital against that opportunity.\n The second I would highlight, which is as the markets are forming capital to support the digital transformation, there have been a disproportionate number of dollars raised on the equity side of the ledger versus the debt. And so if you look at the private equity dry powder that has been raised by the largest infra equity managers to support the evolution of that market, the debt markets have not kept pace. This is one of the main reasons why we went out and acquired the AMP infrastructure debt business, which has been the leading participant in that market for some time. And I think their growth opportunities accelerating under our ownership and our watch. So that was very intentional seeing the secular opportunity developing the way that it is. And I think the debt market is undersupplied relative to the private equity market.\n In real estate, I think the big issue there is going to be what I articulated around opportunistic credit, which is in this rate environment, you have high-quality assets that are owned by high-quality institutional owners, that are upside down on their debt service and need some form of opportunistic credit solution to ultimately realize value on their real estate holdings. And so we're seeing a significant amount of what I would call opportunistic debt opportunities in both the U.S. and Europe to support that investment thesis.\n And then I think given some of the challenges that exist on U.S. bank balance sheets, particularly regional banks, 1 of 2 things will happen, if not both, you'll begin to see primary market share concessions from the banks to nonbank lenders like ourselves. And I think that we can be a much larger participant in new issue volumes as those markets heal. And two, given the size of the installed base of real estate loans, sitting on bank balance sheets and given some of the regulatory capital challenges that they're going through. And then you can also expect that there would be some portfolio acquisitions and opportunistic deals that are going to be coming off bank balance sheets as well that we expect to capitalize on. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. \nBrennan Hawken: Mike, you indicated the desire to not be too reliant on the wealth management channel for fundraising. I just wanted to have a couple of follow-ups about that. Is that because that channel can be a bit pro-cyclical? And what do you see as a good balance as far as fundraising between the channels? \nMichael Arougheti: Yes, I think you're right. It is procyclical. And one of the easiest ways to drive value as an alternative management, in our opinion, is to be countercyclical. We learned I think, earlier than most having run ARCC, the way that we have since 2004 that sometimes those markets are not wanting to grow when the investment opportunity is the best. And so relying on the retail investor to know when the time to allocate is challenging sometimes. So that's point number one. So we learned early running commingled funds with drawdown capacity next to ARCC for over a decade served us well because oftentimes, the institutional investor will turn on when the retail investor is turning off, and that just allows you to be much more consistent in the way that you're investing in deploying through market cycles, and it gives you the luxury of sitting markets out. And there are certain windows in the market where market avoidance is actually a way to generate outperformance.\n The challenge of procyclical capital raising in the retail market is when you get $1 in a traded or non-traded vehicle, just in order to support the continued growth in the dividend, that dollar needs to be put into the market. And so by definition, you are putting capital into the market regardless of the overarching market view. And so we love the channel. We have high expectations for growth in the channel, but we are very focused on making sure that as we grow in that channel, it's alongside prudent growth in the commingled fund families as well, just so that we can make sure that we are investing in these markets when and as we want to. And it's going to be interesting to see, obviously, how this plays out over time and whether or not the retail investor changes in semiliquid vehicles, but it's just something, I think, that's been informed by our experience with the traded BDC market for now 20 years. \nBrennan Hawken: And do you have a view on a good balance between the different channels? \nMichael Arougheti: No. It's -- I can't give you a number because a lot of it just has to do with a constant evaluation that we go through here in terms of what is the deployment capacity that we have in any given strategy, what the pacing of we think that deployment capacity would be and then how we ultimately want to fund it and then not to get into too much of the weeds here, but then you have to look at where you are in the evolution of your drawdown capacity as well because when somebody gives you a dollar and a drawdown fund, there's an expectation for vintage diversification and that you would invest that over 2 to 4 years. So it's a constantly evolving formula when you're looking at the mix of capital and the capacity to deploy. But at the end of the day, it starts with what's the deployment capacity and what do we think the pacing of that is going to be and make sure that we keep the right tension with our capital base. \nBrennan Hawken: Okay. Follow-up. Expectations have been changing a lot around rates, but higher for longer seems to be taking hold. And curious whether or not you have heard or whether or not you would expect here from LPs on a desire to take up hurdle rates given that risk-free rates are higher at this point? \nMichael Arougheti: It's a very good question, and it has not come up. I don't want to say it doesn't come up ever, but it comes up infrequently because as interesting of an idea that may sound we never went and asked for a change in hurdle rates when we were expected to generate significant excess return in the 0 interest rate environment. And so the structure of the market is the structure of the market. We all operate within it. From time to time, someone would academically ask the question whether floating rate hurdles is the way to do it, but the reality is there's downside to that as well. And so I think for the most part, people have agreed that the current construct has worked for 30-plus years and we'll continue to work. So we're not feeling that pressure or not seeing any kind of meaningful move in the market to floating rate hurdles. \nOperator: We have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Michael Arougheti for any closing remarks. \nMichael Arougheti: We don't have any other than to thank everybody for their participation today, and I hope you all have a wonderful quarter, and we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Thank you. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our conference call for today.

            "name": "Jarrod Phillips",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We continue to deliver strong results in the first quarter with mid- to high-teens growth in AUM, management fees, fee-related earnings and realized income along with stronger growth of 28% in our AUM not yet paying fees, which we view as a leading indicator of our capacity for future growth.\n With the current geopolitical risks, sustained inflationary data and high interest rates, our high-quality FRE-based earnings stream provides strong visibility because it's less dependent on the uncertainty arising from the timing of realization activity. As Mike stated, we're off to a solid start in fundraising, raising over $17 billion in the first quarter, and our available capital has reached a new high, positioning us well for future growth and taking advantage of a return to higher levels of M&A activity.\n Starting with revenues. Our management fees totaled over $693 million in the quarter, an increase of 15% compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by the deployment of our available capital. As expected, fee-related performance revenues were also modest in the quarter as the vast majority of FRPR is crystallized in the fourth quarter.\n In our credit segment, our credit FRPR should benefit from the higher for longer interest rate environment, assuming no significant changes to spreads or asset valuations. FRE totaled $302 million, up 18% from the first quarter of 2023, driven by higher management fees and a margin improvement of roughly 150 basis points to 42.1%. We expect continued FRE growth during the rest of 2024 as deployment activity gains momentum throughout the year.\n As Mike mentioned, seasonality, continued rate uncertainty and bid-ask spread differentials on values constrained our realization activity in the first quarter. As a result, we generated $10 million of realized net performance income in the first quarter, up from $7 million a year ago. As we've mentioned on previous earnings calls, our European waterfall realizations are currently more seasonal in nature and meaningfully concentrated in the fourth and second quarters.\n The current seasonality of our European-style waterfall realizations is primarily due to the early stage of our larger eligible credit funds that make distributions to investors to cover tax payments compared to older, smaller European-style funds that are at the end of their life cycles. This seasonality will persist until several of our larger European funds start regularly realizing performance income toward the end of their fund lives.\n For 2024 and 2025, it's best to assume 60% in the fourth quarter, 30% in the second quarter and 10% spread across the other quarters. For the full years 2024 and 2025, we continue to believe that the net realized performance income from European-style waterfall funds will generate $420 million in 2024 and 2025 with over 2/3 of that amount realized in 2025.\n Realized income in the first quarter was $289 million, a 14% increase over the previous year. Importantly, our realized income was entirely comprised of our fee-related earnings due to our limited realized performance income for the quarter. After-tax realized income per share of Class A common stock was $0.80, up 13% from the first quarter of 2023. As of March 31, our AUM stood at $428 billion, up from $360 billion in the previous year, representing a 19% increase. Our fee-paying AUM reached $267 billion at the end of the quarter, up 14% from the previous year.\n Strong deployment across our U.S. and European direct lending, alternative credit and opportunistic credit strategies, all of which pay management fees on invested capital, primarily drove our year-over-year growth in fee-paying AUM.\n Following sustained fundraising momentum, we're building our shadow AUM, setting the stage for higher deployment and future management fee growth. Our AUM not yet paying fees available for future deployment totaled nearly $65 billion at quarter end, representing over $621 million in potential future management fees.\n Our incentive eligible AUM increased by 17% in the first quarter of 2024 to $247 billion. Of this amount, $82 billion is uninvested, representing significant performance fee earning potential. In the first quarter, our net accrued performance income increased to $938 million as we continued to compound interest income above the hurdle rates in our credit strategies. Of the $938 million of net accrued performance income at quarter end, $772 million or just over 80% was in European-style waterfall funds, with $506 million coming from funds that are out of their reinvestment period.\n Finally, in terms of fund performance, we believe our fundraising success is driven by our consistent investment performance throughout market cycles. Our first quarter's performance continues to reinforce that view. Across our credit group, we had another excellent quarter with gross composite returns ranging from approximately 3% to 7% for the quarter, and gross composite returns ranging from 10% to nearly 40% over the last 12 months across our 6 primary credit strategies.\n Across real assets, we generated gross returns and infrastructure debt at approximately 3% for the quarter and 7% for the last 12 months. And in U.S. real estate equity, the quarter composite returns turned positive.\n As Mike stated, we continue to see positive fundamentals in our real estate portfolios, and we're beginning to see signs of a market recovery. Our private equity composite was flat in the quarter but has returned approximately 7% over the last 12 months. Our portfolio fundamentals are sound with low teens year-over-year EBITDA growth. And our latest corporate private equity fund, ACOF VI has generated a 24% gross IRR since inception. Overall, we remain on track for our 20% growth objectives for fee-related earnings and dividends per common share for the year, and we look forward to providing new long-term guidance at our Investor Day on May 21.\n I'll send it back to Mike for closing comments. You got that Mike, either way. Yes, there's nothing really that we talked about it in the fourth quarter. We did have some catch-up fees in both secondaries and real assets. That was about $14.5 million in those two different segments. So what you saw is the effect of those catch-up fees now just being part of our annual run rate. And there and in private equity, it's just regular way of occasionally, there's pay downs within the portfolio and then your fees go down a little bit when you have some aged funds in there. So there's nothing really kind of noteworthy. We still saw -- if you adjust for those catch-up fees, you still saw management fees grow quarter-over-quarter."

            "name": "Michael Arougheti",
            "content": "Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. We hope everybody is doing well. We generated strong first quarter results with double-digit year-over-year growth across our key financial metrics, including 19% growth in AUM, 18% growth in fee-related earnings, over $17 billion in gross capital raised, a 21% increase in our deployment from drawdown funds and strong investment performance across our investment strategies.\n Our AUM increased to $428 billion, which is well ahead of the growth trajectory that we outlined for our year-end 2025 goal of $500 billion and our available capital and AUM not yet paying fees, both reached new records up more than 27% year-over-year.\n In our opinion, we're very well positioned for strong future growth as the transaction environment improves. As we had expected, our first quarter realizations were seasonally light, leading our realized income to be comprised entirely of higher quality, more stable fee-related earnings. Yet, our future performance income potential continues to build as our incentive-generating AUM increased by 26% year-over-year, and our net accrued performance income balance increased by more than $55 million year-over-year despite realizing $136 million in net performance income over the past 12 months.\n As we stated previously, we expect most of the realizations from our European-style funds this year to occur in the second and fourth quarters, with the largest quarterly amount anticipated in the fourth quarter. The economy is proving to be remarkably resilient in the face of higher interest rates and companies in our portfolios are, on the whole, consistently generating strong cash flow and earnings growth.\n Aggregate default levels in our credit portfolios continue to be well below historical levels, while key fundamental credit indicators remain healthy. In the first quarter and continuing into Q2, we are seeing a significant number of upsizing opportunities with our existing borrowers. With over 800 corporate borrowers in our global direct lending portfolio, the benefits of incumbency enable us to efficiently retain and invest more capital to support the growth of our portfolio companies.\n In real estate, operating fundamentals continue to be sound in our highest allocated sectors, particularly within industrial, multifamily and our adjacent sectors like student housing and single-family rental. The strength that we're witnessing is not exclusive to the U.S. European markets are experiencing a moderate rebound in activity across the continent and the economies of the Asia Pacific region are showing signs of growth.\n While we continue to invest in strategic growth initiatives across our firm, such as secondaries, infrastructure and insurance, we believe that we have built one of the top global platforms in private credit, which is one of the fastest-growing sectors and alternatives. We now have over $280 billion in AUM, in what we define as private credit, and it spans direct lending in the U.S., Europe and Asia as well as asset-based credit, opportunistic credit, real estate debt and infrastructure debt.\n We believe that we are early in the transformation of many of these large and fragmented addressable markets, particularly within asset-based credit, opportunistic credit, global infrastructure debt, European real estate debt and Asia private credit.\n For years, we've been investing in the future growth in these areas. And today, we believe that we have leading platforms in many of these segments. For example, our alternative credit team, which now has approximately 70 investment professionals and $36.5 billion in AUM manages what we believe is one of the largest pools of noninsurance capital focused on non-rated asset-based credit. As an example, this flexible capital makes our team an ideal partner for the banking sector's long-term transition away from noncore assets.\n Similarly, we believe that we've been making the necessary investments to benefit from the significant demand for private infrastructure capital solutions over the next several decades, as global players modernize digital infrastructure and transition to sources of clean energy.\n Infrastructure debt is a multitrillion dollar market that has historically been primarily financed by banks and other traditional providers, where we're seeing a growing need for private capital solutions. Our team, which we believe is one of the leading providers of private infrastructure credit, is well positioned for these trends.\n We continue to see strong fundraising momentum across our platform as both institutional and retail investors remain meaningfully under allocated to alternative investments. We believe that we're continuing to capture an increasing percentage of our investors' capital as existing investors are re-upping into new funds and investing across our strategies at a high rate.\n Our fundraising success has come in different rate cycles and economic environments over the past decades, which supports our view that assets follow performance. We believe that we also set ourselves apart with our differentiated deployment capability and market insights as well as a high-quality investor service.\n During the first quarter, we were active with our various private credit strategies and our 2 largest commingled funds in the market have now each exceeded the sizes of their previous vintages. Our third U.S. senior direct lending fund raised an additional $2.8 billion in the first quarter and subsequent to quarter end, raised another $500 million in equity commitments. The fund now has $9.7 billion in equity commitments and over $17 billion in potential investment capacity at quarter end with current and anticipated future leverage. This compares to the previous vintages $8 billion in equity commitments and approximately $14 billion in total investment capacity. We anticipate the fund's final close will occur sometime this summer.\n Our 6 European direct lending fund raised an additional EUR 1 billion in equity commitments in the first quarter, bringing total equity commitments to EUR 11.5 billion, exceeding the previous vintage of EUR 11 billion. The fund has over EUR 17 billion of potential investment capacity at quarter end with current and anticipated future leverage. We're continuing to raise additional capital, and we anticipate a final close towards year-end. Both of these funds are already investing with over 1/3 of the respective current equity commitments deployed for each fund.\n Alternative credit had another strong fundraising quarter despite the absence of a significant campaign fund in the market. We raised $1.5 billion in 3 separate SMAs for large third-party insurance clients in our rated strategies, of which one has already added an incremental $250 million upsize following quarter end.\n Our open-end core alternative credit fund, which accepts new subscriptions up to twice a year, raised nearly $330 million during the quarter. Since its inception less than 3 years ago, this fund has grown to more than $5 billion in AUM.\n In the first quarter, with the CLO markets recovering, we raised $1.7 billion in liquid credit mandates, including 2 CLOs. We also priced 3 additional CLOs in April and through the first 4 months of the year have already exceeded the amount of capital that we raised in CLOs for all of 2023.\n Our wealth solutions platform is beginning to reach an inflection point, where several of our perpetual funds are experiencing accelerating inflows from our efforts to expand our distribution, both domestically and internationally. In fact, our first quarter equity inflows in the wealth channel, which totaled $2 billion, were more than 50% higher than our fourth quarter last year. 30% of the inflows this quarter came from outside the U.S., and we're seeing a material increase in interest from Europe and Asia.\n Our quarter's strong equity inflows were driven by our nontraded BDC, ASIF, which raised nearly $600 million and our direct lending fund in Europe, ASIF, which raised nearly $500 million in its inaugural quarter.\n Our private equity secondaries fund, APMF, is also gaining significant momentum nearing $1 billion in AUM and our diversified credit fund, CABC, surpassed $5 billion in AUM and is seeing a ramp in new international flows. So including leverage in our credit vehicles, we raised nearly $3.2 billion in total AUM in the wealth channel for the quarter. This momentum continued into April with another $800 million in equity inflows.\n Across our 6 nontraded wealth management products, we've reached approximately $25 billion in AUM, nearly 4x the amount that we had following the launch of our Ares Wealth Management Solutions platform less than 3 years ago. Looking ahead, we're excited about further growth in the wealth management channel as our broadening product suite is enabling us to further penetrate within our existing distribution and to attract a growing number of new distribution partners.\n Finally, Aspida continues to experience strong quarterly growth with assets under management increasing by an additional $1.5 billion, reaching $14 billion in total AUM. We continue to pursue an asset-light balance sheet approach to our affiliated insurance platform and are seeing increased third-party interest in funding Aspida. We believe the third-party capital we raised in the first quarter and expect to raise in the coming months will provide us with sufficient runway for Aspida to maintain its strong growth trajectory for the foreseeable future.\n On the Ares balance sheet at quarter end, we had less than $900 million directly invested in either credit assets or in our affiliated insurance vehicle. This represents approximately 0.2% of our total AUM and stands in stark contrast to the amount of on-balance sheet credit assets held by banks and insurance firms across the country. Our entire investment portfolio represents less than 0.5% of our total AUM, which highlights our commitment to an asset-light approach across our businesses.\n Overall, we expect over 35 different funds in the market this year across our investment strategies, including the 2 private credit funds we discussed, our third special opportunities fund, our sixth infrastructure debt fund, our seventh corporate private equity fund, our fourth European value-add real estate fund, our 11th U.S. value-add fund, our second climate infrastructure fund and secondaries funds in infrastructure and credit, to name several.\n As the traditional credit markets have increasingly become more active, this is drawing out more investment activity across the U.S. markets. CLO formation is robust and banks are becoming more competitive in the syndicated loan market driving increasing transaction volumes. Of note, a significant portion of the transaction activity to date has been refinancing related with less coming from new M&A. Although activity levels in our European and Asia Pacific markets are comparatively slower, we expect to see some pickup in transactions in those regions.\n In the quarter, our gross deployment activity increased to $18.6 billion, a 52% increase over the first quarter of last year, including nearly $15 billion in private credit. Since refinancing activity also increased, our net deployment was a little more muted, which slowed our growth in fee-paying AUM. However, we continue to have conviction that the pent-up demand for M&A, the significant amount of private equity dry powder and the demand from LPs to return capital will be conducive to an improved transaction environment this year.\n Across U.S. and European Direct Lending, we deployed more than $11 billion in the quarter, which is more than double our deployment from a year ago period, as we gained significant market share in a relatively slower market environment. We were active with both incumbent borrowers and new companies, finding opportunities to invest in more traditional middle market companies as well as larger businesses that opted for a direct lending solution.\n Alternative credit experienced robust deployment in the quarter with nearly $2.9 billion invested across various asset-based submarkets. Notable transactions include forming an equipment leasing platform, Ansley Park, acquiring a portfolio of newly originated consumer loans from upstart and investing in digital infrastructure in partnership with the infrastructure equity team. Additionally, the team remained active in fund finance, particularly in NAV lending and structured GP solutions. Subsequent to quarter end, we announced a joint venture within the non-QM residential space. supporting over $2.5 billion in new originations.\n In real estate, transaction activity is improving and our pipeline is growing, driven by our substantial dry powder, more economic certainty and compelling market values. We're seeing low double-digit return opportunities in senior debt, mid-teens return opportunities and funding the gaps within capital structures and intriguing equity opportunities, primarily in our core sectors of industrial, multifamily and student housing. And within secondaries, transaction volumes are expanding with GP-led transactions continuing to outpace LP-led opportunities. We anticipate LP-led opportunities to gain further momentum as portfolios reprice and liquidity needs increase. As an example, in April, we completed the largest LP-led private equity secondaries transaction in our firm's history.\n And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jarrod for more detailed comments on our quarterly financial highlights and outlook. Jarrod? Great. Thanks, Jarrod. We believe our first quarter highlights not only our significant momentum, but also the future growth potential across our business lines. Over the past several years, we've made investments in building out new investment platforms and distribution in significant new growth segments that are now coming online and contributing to our growth profile. These areas include alternative credit, infrastructure, real estate debt, APAC credit, secondaries, wealth management and insurance. We hope to capitalize on these segments secular drivers in the years ahead.\n We've also continued to heavily invest in our more scaled investing strategies, which positions us to outperform when markets get more competitive. As you can see from our first quarter's results, our fundraising momentum remains robust, and we're positioned for growth with a record amount of dry powder and 28% growth in our AUM not yet paying fees. We believe our asset-light business model provides consistent and substantial earnings growth, while limiting our exposure to the volatility of the financial markets.\n And as Jarrod stated, we have great visibility into the future earnings streams from our European waterfall style funds in the years to come. We look forward to providing a deep dive into our business and discussing our promising long-term outlook with you at our Investor Day in a few weeks. And as always, I'm grateful for our team's hard work and dedication, and I appreciate our investors' ongoing support of our company.\n And operator, with that, I think we can now open up the line for questions. Sure. So if you look at the ARCC performance and obviously, look at what we're doing elsewhere in our private credit businesses, I think you're going to see high quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year gross deployment. I do think that we continue to not just hold market share, but gain share, and I'll come back to that in a second. And right now, given that transaction activity has been muted, you could see it in the syndicated loan and high-yield market too, that the transaction activity is skewing more towards refis than new issue activity.\n We've been able to defend the portfolio from that and grow, which I think is very differentiated just given our portfolio size and incumbency. And so I do think both on a gross and net deployment basis, we're outperforming. I would say that spreads have tightened and until we see new activity accelerate, you could expect they may tighten a little bit more from here. They've been stabilized over the last couple of weeks, the pipeline would indicate that they get hold here. But I feel really good about the fundraising and the supply of capital versus the demand, particularly for us.\n One other differentiator, I think, too, is, some of the peer set, I think, are overly relying on the wealth channel for the growth in their private credit capital. And that's, frankly, just a much harder part of equation to manage in terms of the flows versus the deployment, particularly when you get into market back up like this. So I do feel one of the ways that we've been able to outperform in this context is the diversity of the funds that we have in terms of drawdown and nontraded just gives us a little bit of a capital advantage through cycles. Yes, I think we would -- we're looking for a pickup as well. One of the benefits of being in the private market is you see that pipeline developing before the M&A numbers become public. We talked about this in our year-end call. We are seeing the ingredients for a pickup in M&A activity, both within the sponsored and nonsponsored part of the world. That's a combination of stabilized rates, putting aside whether rates will go down to stabilized rates, by definition should spur transaction activity in the private equity part of the market. Obviously, there is a pretty significant demand from the LP community to see a return of capital, and that should accelerate transaction activity as well.\n One flip side to the technicals and the loan and high-yield market right now is as that machine turns on, it, by definition, spurs transaction activity. And I would also think that, that would be an accelerant. So everything we're seeing would indicate that deal flow will pick up as we move through the year. Obviously, if you look at the advisory community and you talk to the sell side, I think they'll tell you that the shadow pipeline is picking up as well. And we're also optimistic and we're seeing this too in the real estate side of the business, that transaction activity is beginning to unfreeze there as well. Sure. So maybe just zooming out, obviously, the insurance opportunity is an important one for someone like us, obviously, with a market-leading position in private credit. We have chosen to build our insurance solutions practice here to support a pretty large and significant amount of third-party insurance clients as well as our own affiliated insurance business, both of which continue to be fast growing.\n With regard to our affiliated insurance platform, Aspida, if you go back to our Investor Day in the summer of 2021, we laid out an expectation that, that business would approach $25 billion AUM by the end of 2025 on $500 million of guidance. We are on track for that, if not pacing ahead of that. And you could see that in the numbers. We continue to raise third-party capital to grow that business. AUM is up to $14 billion and a very healthy combination of organic annuities distribution and reinsurance relationships would have us growing quite nicely there. The fundraising momentum for the affiliated insurance company is very strong right now. And as we talked about in the prepared remarks, our expectation is as we make our way through the second quarter that the equity that we'll raise there would be ample to meet or exceed the growth objectives of that business.\n In terms of the fees there, the structure is probably what you're used to seeing. We do get an administrative fee on the entirety of the affiliated balance sheet for the services that we provide on capital markets, investment advisory, actuarial, et cetera, and then arm's length fees on the sub-advised strategies as well. Those fees -- the sub-advise fees in terms of our financial presentation are showing up in the underlying business lines, not in the Insurance Solutions P&L. So when you go to the segment reporting, a lot of the financial benefit of that is showing up in our alternative credit business and our secondaries business. But we have been pretty vocal that our goal is to continue to pursue an asset-light approach to this opportunity that we will continue to grow and nurture our third-party insurance clients, which now represent over $50 billion with close to 150 separate insurance relationships. And so I think you'll continue to see the third-party business grow alongside the rapid growth of the affiliate. Sure. Look, I think the good news is, and we've said this before, while the market, I think, has come to appreciate the leadership position that we stake out in credit, they may underappreciate the leadership position that we've staked out in other parts of our business. If you were to look at our real assets platform, our real estate business continues to grow and diversify, both in the U.S. and in Europe. And I would expect continued management fee growth across that platform.\n If you look at our infrastructure business, obviously, we have a meaningful climate infrastructure and energy transaction -- transition practice that's growing. We are one of the market leaders on the infrastructure debt space. We believe that, that is a significant global addressable market that is meaningfully undercapitalized, and we'd expect, as we continue to lean into the fundraise for our sixth infrastructure debt fund that will be able to drive pretty meaningful management fee growth there.\n We talked about insurance, that's going to be a meaningful growth engine for us. So most, if not all, of the businesses across the platform are growing at trend. Some will grow faster given the secular backdrop. But I think the diversity of the strategies you'll see are continuing to mature and a lot of the competitive advantages that we've created in credit around scale and origination and information are now starting to show up in real assets and secondaries and PE, et cetera. So I -- without going into every line of business, I think you should come to expect with some episodic growth. But if you smooth it that you're going to see trend growth from almost every business here. Sure. Thank you for asking that question because Alex asked for noncredit growth areas. And so you just teed up, I think, one of the most exciting areas within credit, which is what we would broadly call opportunistic credit, obviously, alternative credit as well. And you hit the nail on the head. In a higher for longer rate environment where asset values have if not come down are difficult to transact on and debt service becomes tight.\n The nature of conversations that we are having with institutional owners of real assets and companies is largely the same, which is I have a high-performing asset that I paid a full price for and a different discount rate and interest rate environment. I need to own it longer in order to realize on my investment thesis, while I'm performing a disproportionate amount of my EBITDA and cash flow and NOI is going to debt service and I need a way to create a runway to execute on my business plan, and that's where most of the businesses here are turning on. And so we're calling on private equity sponsors and institutional real asset owners with a full complement of liquidity solutions, ranging from an opportunistic credit solution that could be structured debt and equity to deleverage and reduce cash burden. We're calling on them with plain vanilla refis. We're calling on them with secondary solutions at the portfolio company level. We're calling on them with NAV loans and fund finance solutions. But most of the origination here is trained on that singular issue, which is high-quality assets with \"bad balance sheets\" that need some form of resolution. And I think opportunistic credit is going to be a big beneficiary of that.\n The issue is particularly acute in private equity because if you look at private equity today in terms of the purchase price multiple environment leading up to the run-up in rates, we were close to two standard deviations higher than historical average on private equity purchase price going into the rate hiking cycle. And so even for the highest quality business, you could argue that there's probably a 30% gap in the capital structure that needs to get filled today with some kind of solution.\n I mentioned the difficulty from a DPI standpoint that the PE market, in particular, is experiencing and the need to get capital back to LPs is very, very acute. And PE now, it's interesting, there's about 3.5x the amount of dollars in the ground in the private equity market than there are sitting undeployed in dry powder. And if you go back to prior cycles, that's typically been at equilibrium where you had $1 in the ground versus $1 uninvested. So in a world where $3.5 trillion is sitting invested in these capital structures and $1 trillion is available for either reinvestment into the existing portfolio or to do new deals, there needs to be some very precise decisions being made by the owners of these companies as to how to use that dry powder. And so opportunistic credit is a very logical way to bring capital and that's not dilutive to the equity, but addresses whatever liquidity challenge may exist and gives the company runway. So we're very optimistic for that part of the market and part of our fundraising strategy for this year is to bring the next vintage fund in that strategy to market this year as well. No, I don't think so. I mean -- go ahead, Jarrod. I was just going to add one thing, Ben, if I may because I didn't know if you're asking about the management fee line item or fee rates. I think it's important. If you look historically, we've been maintaining a fee rate between 100 and 110 basis points pretty consistently. If you were to go strategy by strategy, you'll actually see that the management fee rate quarter-over-quarter has been flat and in certain strategies is slightly up. So putting aside the quarter-over-quarter narrative that Jarrod highlighted, I think it's important in a given quarter, you may see a slight mix shift that will show a little bit of variability in the management fee, but the headline fee rates are holding. Yes, we -- I can't really give you a linear view on where the drivers of growth are going to come from. And maybe just to give people a sense for what our wealth management business looks like today, we have about 150 wealth professionals that are singularly focused on distributing and servicing our family of wealth product. We continue to build out the number of products on our platform as well as the number of distribution partners that we have. Today, we have 2 non-traded REITs, a private equity fund, a nontraded BDC, a European credit fund, a credit interval fund, and we are in the process of introducing new funds into the market as well.\n The existing fund family, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, raised about $3.2 billion in the first quarter. That was up from $2 billion in Q4 and $900 million a year ago. So roughly 2.5 plus times growth year-over-year and 50% growth quarter-over-quarter. And April, on the equity side alone, we raised $800 million. So if you assume roughly the same 1:1 leverage, that would be roughly a levered amount. So there's a lot of growth that we're experiencing, and it's a combination of increasing distribution partnerships, building out the fund platform. And I think a real bright spot for us has been the very rapid results that we're seeing in our international distribution. We highlighted AESIF, which is our European credit fund, and they had a very strong inaugural quarter, and we continue to see a lot of international demand for that as well. So we have a road map, obviously, to continue to add distribution partners and new products. And so I think these numbers will both diversify and grow. That has not been our experience. We have talked for quite some time with all of you just about the opportunity that we see given our leadership position and scale. And one of the things that we have talked about is that as these markets consolidate, the larger LPs are doing more business with fewer scale managers that can need a broad base of needs. And so private credit, and there's some pretty good data putting aside the frequent report from private debt and other publications that just show the concentration of fundraising and deployment in the hands of the largest managers with us near or at the top of the list. So I think, thankfully, we're not having that experience. We talked about the very positive experience we've seen in our third senior loan fund, which has already exceeded the prior vintage, our 6 European fund, which has already exceeded the prior vintage. We're seeing good momentum in our real estate credit fund. As I mentioned, obviously, we are working through our sixth infrastructure private credit fund. And if the BDC and interval funds that we have in the wealth channel or any indication, I think our brand continues to resonate there. So that has not been our experience, but we're watching the industry data as well.\n If you could attribute it to one thing and frequent hint of this, I do think given the rate environment, you are beginning to see dispersion of performance. And I think that there are many people who think that being great in direct lending is maybe easier than it really is. And you're beginning to see certain managers underperforming, and there could be a little bit of a cautionary moment here where people want to see the credit performance work through their portfolios with certain managers. But no, we're seeing continued demand, and we would expect that to continue. Sure. Thanks, Mike. So maybe we'll handle them separately because they're both benefiting from different opportunities and different trends covering maybe infrastructure debt first. There are two things I would highlight. One of them you pointed to, which is just the significant amount of capital that is needed to hasten the transition in digital infrastructure to support the hyperscale data center rollout. That is roughly by our estimation, a $5 trillion capital opportunity and the market is woefully undercapitalized to take advantage of it. We are one of the leading debt providers in that market and continue to add people and capital against that opportunity.\n The second I would highlight, which is as the markets are forming capital to support the digital transformation, there have been a disproportionate number of dollars raised on the equity side of the ledger versus the debt. And so if you look at the private equity dry powder that has been raised by the largest infra equity managers to support the evolution of that market, the debt markets have not kept pace. This is one of the main reasons why we went out and acquired the AMP infrastructure debt business, which has been the leading participant in that market for some time. And I think their growth opportunities accelerating under our ownership and our watch. So that was very intentional seeing the secular opportunity developing the way that it is. And I think the debt market is undersupplied relative to the private equity market.\n In real estate, I think the big issue there is going to be what I articulated around opportunistic credit, which is in this rate environment, you have high-quality assets that are owned by high-quality institutional owners, that are upside down on their debt service and need some form of opportunistic credit solution to ultimately realize value on their real estate holdings. And so we're seeing a significant amount of what I would call opportunistic debt opportunities in both the U.S. and Europe to support that investment thesis.\n And then I think given some of the challenges that exist on U.S. bank balance sheets, particularly regional banks, 1 of 2 things will happen, if not both, you'll begin to see primary market share concessions from the banks to nonbank lenders like ourselves. And I think that we can be a much larger participant in new issue volumes as those markets heal. And two, given the size of the installed base of real estate loans, sitting on bank balance sheets and given some of the regulatory capital challenges that they're going through. And then you can also expect that there would be some portfolio acquisitions and opportunistic deals that are going to be coming off bank balance sheets as well that we expect to capitalize on. Yes, I think you're right. It is procyclical. And one of the easiest ways to drive value as an alternative management, in our opinion, is to be countercyclical. We learned I think, earlier than most having run ARCC, the way that we have since 2004 that sometimes those markets are not wanting to grow when the investment opportunity is the best. And so relying on the retail investor to know when the time to allocate is challenging sometimes. So that's point number one. So we learned early running commingled funds with drawdown capacity next to ARCC for over a decade served us well because oftentimes, the institutional investor will turn on when the retail investor is turning off, and that just allows you to be much more consistent in the way that you're investing in deploying through market cycles, and it gives you the luxury of sitting markets out. And there are certain windows in the market where market avoidance is actually a way to generate outperformance.\n The challenge of procyclical capital raising in the retail market is when you get $1 in a traded or non-traded vehicle, just in order to support the continued growth in the dividend, that dollar needs to be put into the market. And so by definition, you are putting capital into the market regardless of the overarching market view. And so we love the channel. We have high expectations for growth in the channel, but we are very focused on making sure that as we grow in that channel, it's alongside prudent growth in the commingled fund families as well, just so that we can make sure that we are investing in these markets when and as we want to. And it's going to be interesting to see, obviously, how this plays out over time and whether or not the retail investor changes in semiliquid vehicles, but it's just something, I think, that's been informed by our experience with the traded BDC market for now 20 years. No. It's -- I can't give you a number because a lot of it just has to do with a constant evaluation that we go through here in terms of what is the deployment capacity that we have in any given strategy, what the pacing of we think that deployment capacity would be and then how we ultimately want to fund it and then not to get into too much of the weeds here, but then you have to look at where you are in the evolution of your drawdown capacity as well because when somebody gives you a dollar and a drawdown fund, there's an expectation for vintage diversification and that you would invest that over 2 to 4 years. So it's a constantly evolving formula when you're looking at the mix of capital and the capacity to deploy. But at the end of the day, it starts with what's the deployment capacity and what do we think the pacing of that is going to be and make sure that we keep the right tension with our capital base. It's a very good question, and it has not come up. I don't want to say it doesn't come up ever, but it comes up infrequently because as interesting of an idea that may sound we never went and asked for a change in hurdle rates when we were expected to generate significant excess return in the 0 interest rate environment. And so the structure of the market is the structure of the market. We all operate within it. From time to time, someone would academically ask the question whether floating rate hurdles is the way to do it, but the reality is there's downside to that as well. And so I think for the most part, people have agreed that the current construct has worked for 30-plus years and we'll continue to work. So we're not feeling that pressure or not seeing any kind of meaningful move in the market to floating rate hurdles. We don't have any other than to thank everybody for their participation today, and I hope you all have a wonderful quarter, and we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Thank you."
